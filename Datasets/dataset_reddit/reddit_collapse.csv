"The World’s 2,000 Billionaires Have More Wealth Than Almost 5 Billion People Combined...Fact: Overconsumption by the elite and extreme wealth inequality have occurred in the collapse of every civilization over the last 5,000 years.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-2-000-billionaires-more-090047225.html,"Wealth inequality is nothing new, but it’s reached staggering proportions in 2020. An Oxfam report released in January found that the world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than that of 4.6 billion other people combined — meaning they are wealthier than 60% of the earth’s entire population combined.

Even more troubling is the fact that these billionaires’ wealth has increased by nearly 30% during the first six months of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Business Insider. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to make ends meet.

The 22 Richest Men Have More Wealth Than All the Women of an Entire Continent

The Oxfam report also estimated that the world’s 22 richest men have more wealth than all the women in Africa combined.

“Women and girls, who spend billions of hours cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and the elderly, are the backbone of our global economy yet benefit the least from it,” Paul O’Brien, vice president of policy and advocacy at Oxfam America, said in a release about the report. “It’s no accident that while most billionaires are men, women handle the care work and dominate the least secure and lowest-paid jobs. Women and girls are subsidizing our sexist economies, enabling rich, white, male billionaires to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of the poorest.”

The Top 1% Is Wealthier Than You Can Imagine

According to Oxfam, the world’s richest 1% of the population have more than twice the wealth of 6.9 billion people. At the same time, around 735 million people are living in extreme poverty.

You Could Save $10,000 a Day and Never Be as Rich as the 5 Richest Billionaires

Saving $10,000 a day is unrealistic for most people, but even if you could, your wealth would never catch up to the wealth of the richest billionaires. According to Oxfam, if you began saving $10,000 a day since the building of the pyramids in Egypt — which dates back to 2,504 B.C. — you would only have one-fifth the average fortune of the five richest billionaires.

The Wealth of Billionaires Is Literally Astronomical Compared to the Average Person

According to the Oxfam report, “if everyone were to sit on their wealth piled up in $100 bills, most of humanity would be sitting on the floor. A middle-class person in a rich country would be sitting at the height of a chair. The world’s two richest men would be sitting in outer space.”

Three Men Are Wealthier Than the Bottom Half of Americans

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffet have a combined net worth of about $300 billion. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of Americans have a combined net worth of $255 billion, according to Inequality.org.

The Concentration of Wealth Has Spiked in Recent Decades

Inequality.org analyzed Forbes’ list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and found that the people on this list have grown exponentially wealthier over time. After adjusting for inflation, the average person on the Forbes 400 list had a net worth of $600 million in 1982; in 2019, the average was $7.4 billion.

Who Is It? This Is America’s Favorite Billionaire

Jeff Bezos Is Worth 21 Times as Much as the Richest American of 1982

In 1982, shipping magnate Daniel Ludwig topped Forbes’ first list of the 400 richest Americans with an adjusted net worth of $5.3 billion. Bezos topped the list in 2019 with a net worth of $114 billion — which is actually much lower than his predivorce net worth of $162.9 billion in 2018.

The Rich Are Getting Richer While the Poor Are Getting Poorer

According to data from the National Bureau of Economic Research, in 1983, the top 0.1% of Americans had an average net worth of $43.3 million, adjusted to 2016 dollars; in 2016, the top 0.1% had an average net worth of $100.8 million. Meanwhile, the bottom 40% of Americans had a net worth of $6,900 in 1983, adjusted to 2016 dollars. By 2016, the bottom 40% had an average net worth of -$8,900 — this “negative wealth” is due to debts exceeding assets.

The Richest 5% of Americans Control Two-Thirds of the Country's Wealth

In 2016, the top 5% of Americans controlled 66.7% of the nation’s wealth, while the bottom 90% combined controlled just 21.2%, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. It wasn’t always this way — from the Great Depression through the next three decades, the share of America’s wealth held by the wealthiest Americans had dropped. But now that evening out has been almost completely undone.

The Top 1% Own More Than Half the Stocks Owned by Americans

The bottom 90% of Americans own only 11.9% of the stock held by Americans, while the top 1% own 54.2% of U.S. stock assets, according to Federal Reserve Distributional Financial Accounts data from the third quarter of 2019. Meanwhile, the bottom 90% has 75.3% of the debt and the top 1% has less than 5%.

The Top 1% of Americans Are Wealthier Than the Entire Middle Class

As of 2016, the top 1% of Americans owned $25 trillion in assets — 29% — of household wealth while the entire middle class — the middle 60% of Americans — owned just $18 trillion in assets, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances.

$165 Million for Jeff Bezos Is Equivalent to $121 for Most Americans

In February, Bezos purchased a $165 million home in Los Angeles — the most expensive residential property in the history of the city, according to the Los Angeles Times. Remarkably, the home is only worth roughly 0.125% of his total net worth. That means the money he spent on his house would be the equivalent of an American with a median net worth spending $121 on a home.

Every Second, Jeff Bezos Makes More Than Twice What the Average American Makes in a Week

Bezos makes $2,489 per second, according to Business Insider calculations. Meanwhile, the median U.S. worker makes $936 a week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

It Takes Jeff Bezos 15 Minutes To Earn What the Average College-Educated Man Will Make in His Lifetime

A man with a bachelor’s degree is expected to earn about $2.2 million over the course of his lifetime, according to a 2015 study published in Demography. Bezos can earn that amount of money in less than 15 minutes, according to Business Insider calculations.

The World's Billionaires Are Worth Nearly Half of the US' GDP

The gross domestic product of the U.S. is $21.7 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Meanwhile, the roughly 2,100 billionaires in the world are worth a combined $10 trillion.

The 400 Richest Americans Own More Wealth Than 33 Million Typical American Families

The median American family has a net worth of $80,000, excluding their car. The combined net worth of the richest 400 Americans is equivalent to the worth of 33 million of the typical American family, a 2017 report by the Institute for Policy Studies found.

America's Wealthiest Families Are Seeing Their Wealth Grow Exponentially While the Average American's Wealth Is Decreasing

Three of the richest families in America — the Waltons, the Kochs and the Mars family — have seen their wealth increase nearly 6,000% since 1982, according to a 2018 report by Inequality.org. Meanwhile, the median household wealth has decreased by 3% over that same time period.

America's Wealthiest Families Are 4 Million Times Richer Than the Average Family

The Waltons, the Kochs and the Marses are worth a combined $348.7 billion — more than 4 million times the median wealth of U.S. families, according to the Inequality.org report.

An Amazon Worker Would Need To Work 2.5 Million Years To Generate Jeff Bezos' Wealth

It would take an Amazon worker earning the company’s minimum wage of $15 an hour 2.5 million years to generate Bezos’ earnings. To put that in perspective, that’s more than 10 times the length of all human existence.

1 in 4 Childless Adults Say Climate Change Has Factored Into Their Reproductive Decisions,https://morningconsult.com/2020/09/28/adults-children-climate-change-polling/,"11% of childless adults say climate change is a “major reason” they don’t currently have children, while 15% say it is a “minor reason.”

Childless Hispanic adults are especially likely to say climate change has factored into their reproductive decisions, at 41%.

A new series from Morning Consult takes a deeper look at how the coronavirus could permanently alter millennials’ behavior and how, in turn, that could impact the economy at large. The data is drawn from a poll of 4,400 adults, including 1,287 millennials.

For some childless adults, climate change looms large when they consider whether or not to reproduce. According to recent Morning Consult data, 11 percent of that group say climate change is a “major reason” they do not currently have children, and 15 percent say it plays a minor role. While climate change was among the least-cited reasons for those who do not currently have children (behind financial, political and career concerns, among others), the fact that it comes to mind for a quarter of respondents underscores the fact that its impacts are becoming increasingly visible to the public.

Childless Hispanic respondents were especially likely to say their concern for climate change has impacted their plans, with 41 percent saying it is a major or minor reason they don’t have children. Thirty percent of Black respondents and 23 percent of whites said the same. This demographic breakdown largely mirrors responses to another poll asking respondents how much of a role climate change has played in recent natural disasters; Black and Hispanic respondents to that survey were especially likely to say climate change contributed substantially to events like the ongoing wildfires scorching the West Coast. And regionally, 33 percent of those in the West said climate change plays a part in their reproductive decision-making. Adults (both with and without children) in the region were also more likely than their counterparts in other parts of the country to say they were considering moving due to natural disasters. The Sept. 8-10 poll surveyed 4,400 U.S. adults. The overall poll has a margin of error of 1 percentage point, and the childless group (2,201 adults) has a margin of error of 2 points. The margin of error is 2 points for white adults and 6 points for both Hispanic and Black adults."
America Is Too Broken to Fight the Coronavirus. No other developed country is doing so badly.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/opinion/us-coronavirus-trump.html?smid=re-share,"When coronavirus cases started exploding on the East Coast in March, there were devastating failures by Democratic leaders. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, not only forced nursing homes to take back residents who’d been hospitalized for the coronavirus, he barred them from testing the residents to see if they were still infected.

As ProPublica reported, following Cuomo’s order, “Covid-19 tore through New York state’s nursing facilities, killing more than 6,000 people — about 6 percent of its more than 100,000 nursing home residents.” In Florida, which prohibited such transfers, the virus has so far killed only 1.6 percent of nursing home residents.

Given how Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, it’s hard to say how much credit he deserves for eventually rising to the occasion. Still, by the time New York’s cases got to where Arizona’s are now, he at least understood that the state faced calamity and imposed the lockdown that helped bring it back from the abyss.

Arizona, Florida and Texas, by contrast, aren’t even doing simple things like mandating mask-wearing. Worse, until last week, the governors of Arizona and Texas prevented cities from instituting their own such requirements.

So far, evidence about the role mass protests over police violence played in coronavirus spikes is mixed, but liberal support for the demonstrations solidified the conviction among many conservatives that strict social distancing rules are a hypocritical tool of social control. The paranoia and resentment that have long been part of the culture of the modern right are now directed at those warning about the ongoing dangers of the pandemic.

Across the country, public health workers have faced death threats, harassment and armed protesters at their homes. No matter how bad things get in red America, it’s hard to imagine where the political will to contain the virus will come from.

So while countries with competent leadership haltingly return to normal, ours will continue to be pummeled. In mid-May, when America’s coronavirus death toll was around 85,000, Trump sycophant Lindsey Graham said that as long as fatalities didn’t go much beyond 120,000, “I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.”

By The Times’s count, we just hit that number. The war goes on, but Trump has already lost it."
"The Brazilian president has fired the head of the country’s space agency over data that shows deforestation up 40% year-over-year. He called the report ""a lie"" even though it's based on high resolution satellite images that have a 95% accuracy rate.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/08/05/bolsonaro-fire-deforestation-denial-sacking-space-agency-chief/,"The Brazilian president forced a top science official out of his job, in a move experts warned could harm the credibility of agricultural exporters

By Chloé Farand

The Brazilian government is under fire for denying scientific evidence, after president Jair Bolsonaro sacked the head of the country’s space agency over deforestation data.

Ricardo Galvao, the head of Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) – the agency which provides official data on the country’s deforestation rate – was fired after Bolsonaro dismissed INPE’s latest report as “a lie”.

The latest data released by INPE shows that deforestation has increased 40% in the last two months compared to the same period a year ago.

Bolsonaro accused the agency of overstating the scale of destruction, saying: “We cannot accept sensationalism, or the disclosure of inaccurate numbers that cause great damage to Brazil‘s image.”

However experts defended the agency. Paulo Barreto, a senior researcher at NGO Imazon, told Climate Home News said if anything the monthly reports erred on the conservative side. INPE’s annual reports, which are based on higher resolution satellite images, have a 95% accuracy rate, he said.

In an interview with Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, Galvao called Bolsonaro a “coward” for attacking his record without meeting him face to face.

“[Galvao] knew he was exposing himself but he did it for the sake of science,” Carlos Rittl, a scientist and the executive secretary of Brazilian NGO Climate Observatory told CHN.

The row has put the Bolsonaro administration under the spotlight, drawing further attention to surging rainforest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon.

INPE is seen as the authority on deforestation and land-use changes data from Brazil. It uses satellite images to produce monthly and annual reports on the rate of deforestation across the country.

Following Galvao’s dismissal, Brazil’s environment minister Ricardo Salles said methodologies for measuring deforestation would be changed and the government would use new technology with greater precision to monitor land use changes.

For Rittl, the use of a monitoring system with higher resolution satellite images is likely to paint an “even worse” picture, rather than fit Bolsonaro’s agenda to open up protected areas of the forest for agriculture and logging.

“Bolsonaro has not yet understood the implications for trying to hide the science,” Rittl said, pointing to the Brazilian economy’s heavy reliance on exports, with the prospect of large markets like the EU closing their doors to deforestation products.

Last month, the EU Commission announced it was considering imposing regulation on the supply chains of companies importing into its market, in a bid to tackle forest clearance abroad.

Meanwhile, the Mercosur trade agreement signed between the EU and the South American trading bloc includes a commitment to tackle deforestation – although critics have raised concerns over the lack of enforceable safeguards.

“If we lose more forests, I think at the end of the day we will lose more markets,” Rittl said. “Right now, the EU will have to play hard on the Brazilian government.”

Barreto agreed denial of the science brought economic risks, noting that agribusiness companies were “under pressure from investors to disclose the impacts of deforestation and climate change”.

Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland, said INPE had long been at the forefront of a transparent system of data collection which informed government policy.

INPE’s annual reports are based on available Nasa satellite images. That means campaign groups and academics around the world can independently analyse the same raw information, checking the official figures.

Those currently providing near real-time monitoring of the Brazil’s rainforest include Imazon, Global Forest Watch, a network of organisations and academics known as MapBiomas led by Climate Observatory, the University of Maryland and the Brazilian army.

Morton said INPE was critical because its reports have long been used across government agencies to develop Brazil’s environmental policies and manage the country’s resources.

“I worry more about the interruption of this information flow which would impede informing government legislation,” he said.

And the issue is not limited to the Brazilian government. Morton told CHN international observers, supply chains and investors may have to transition to use external estimates such as NGO reports to inform their policies on deforestation.

In previous years, the head of INPE has been chosen by the Brazilian government from a shortlist of three compiled by a committee of scientists. Whether the same procedure will be used by Bolsonaro’s government to replace Galvao is yet unknown.

Coronavirus has led to the largest ever drop in CO2 emissions! Which is....4%. Then you remember we need a 100% drop by 2050.,https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-set-to-cause-largest-ever-annual-fall-in-co2-emissions,"The global coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold at a staggering pace, decimating lives, livelihoods and the normal functioning of society, as well as interrupting energy demand and CO2 emissions.

Previous Carbon Brief analysis showed that the crisis temporarily cut CO2 emissions in China by 25%, with emissions still below normal more than two months after the country entered lockdown.

With dozens more countries enforcing lockdowns in response to the pandemic, a wide range of indicators show how transport use, electricity demand and industrial activity are being cut. Yet there have been few attempts, thus far, to quantify the consequences for global CO2 emissions.

To date, most global estimates have been based on informed speculation, or on forecasts of reduced GDP growth. Many have also warned that emissions will quickly rebound, unless the response to the pandemic can create lasting, structural changes towards net-zero emissions.

Here, Carbon Brief gathers the latest evidence on how the coronavirus crisis is affecting energy use and CO2 emissions around the world, as a way to sense-check the GDP-based estimates.

Five key datasets and projections are identified, covering roughly three-quarters of the world’s annual CO2 emissions, including the entire output of China and the US, the EU carbon market, the Indian power sector and the global oil sector.

Carbon Brief analysis of this data suggests the pandemic could cause emissions cuts this year in the region of 2,000m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). Although this number is necessarily uncertain, countries and sectors not yet included in the analysis can be expected to add to the total.

Update 15 April 2020: This analysis was updated in light of new forecasts for global oil demand in 2020, which suggest a significantly larger drop this year. The original version had put the potential impact of coronavirus at 1,600MtCO2 in 2020, equivalent to 4% of 2019 emissions.

This updated tentative estimate is equivalent to around 5.5% of the global total in 2019. As a result, the coronavirus crisis could trigger the largest ever annual fall in CO2 emissions in 2020, more than during any previous economic crisis or period of war.

Even this would not come close to bringing the 1.5C global temperature limit within reach. Global emissions would need to fall by some 7.6% every year this decade – nearly 2,800MtCO2 in 2020 – in order to limit warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.

To put it another way, atmospheric carbon levels are expected to increase again this year, even if CO2 emissions cuts are greater still. Rising CO2 concentrations – and related global warming – will only stabilise once annual emissions reach net-zero.

Update 30 April 2020: The International Energy Agency has forecast the CO2 impact of the crisis, suggesting emissions could fall by 8% this year, some 2,600MtCO2. It draws on more recent data and covers 100% of global emissions, whereas Carbon Brief’s estimate was based on information covering only around 75% of the total.

Emissions data challenges

It is important to stress before explaining Carbon Brief’s analysis that there are many challenges when it comes to estimating the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global emissions in 2020.

The most significant of these are timely data availability, attribution of any changes to coronavirus, and the huge uncertainty over the path and duration of the crisis.

For example, UK data on demand for petroleum products is published monthly, but the figures for January were only released at the end of March. Similarly, the 20 March release of UK tax data – including fuel duty receipts reflecting road-traffic volumes – only covers the month of February.

Estimates of annual global CO2 emissions are usually first published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) in November or December of the year in question, but more definitive figures only arrive the following spring. Official emissions inventories can take years to be finalised.

The US Energy Information Administration (US EIA) publishes national energy data and emissions estimates only a few weeks in arrears. Yet in its 8 April weekly report on oil markets, it notes that, on a global basis, “real-time data remain limited”.

Robbie Andrew, senior researcher in climate economics at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway and a contributor to the GCP, tells Carbon Brief:

“We get frequently updated economic stats, but environmental stats are just occasional. How would it change the way we think if, every time economic stats were published, there were environmental stats updated alongside?”

In terms of attributing any changes to the on-going pandemic, a long list of confounding factors cloud the picture. This means it is hard to attribute a changing indicator solely to coronavirus, given multiple reasons why fossil-fuel demand in March 2020 might have fallen, relative to the same month in previous years.

The mild winter across Europe and North America has cut demand for heating in the first quarter of the year, for example, making it cheaper to burn gas for power and industry. Temperatures also affect electricity demand. Adjustments to account for this are possible, but add complexity.

Renewable capacity was already rising, eating into the market share of fossil fuels, while sunny and windy weather has boosted the output of existing windfarms and solar parks relative to last year.

These trends, combined with low gas prices that were also unrelated to coronavirus, mean coal-fired electricity was already plummeting in many countries – and was expected to continue doing so.

As a practical example, German electricity got much cleaner in the first quarter of 2020, cutting emissions by 20m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2). But only a quarter of this (5MtCO2) was due to the pandemic, according to analysis from the thinktank Agora Energiewende.

German power market developments in Q1 2020:



Renewables +14%



Nuclear -18%

Lignite -33% (!)

Hard Coal -44% (!)



Gas +/-0



Demand -3%

Exports -43% (!) https://t.co/oweWgLzX3U pic.twitter.com/wiglFSGGAr — Philipp Litz (@PhilippLitz) April 1, 2020

Second-order effects add to this already complicated situation. The drop in oil demand due to the pandemic is being compounded by a price war, in which Saudi Arabia and Russia have raised their output. This means oil prices are tumbling, as are those for gas, because of oil-linked contracts.

Finally, the unprecedented nature of the current crisis makes all forecasts and predictions even more than usually susceptible to being wrong. The duration of the crisis and the timing of lockdowns being lifted are particularly uncertain.

In its latest short-term projections, the US EIA says that it expects the biggest hit to oil demand in the second quarter of 2020, but that the reduction will only “gradually dissipat[e] over the course of the next 18 months”. Its outlook notes:

“Although all market outlooks are subject to many risks, the April edition of EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook is subject to heightened levels of uncertainty because the impacts of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on energy markets are still evolving.”

Marcus Ferdinand, head of European carbon and power analytics for data provider ICIS, published one early analysis on 24 March, looking at how coronavirus would affect the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). This covers EU emissions from electricity generation, industry and aviation.

Ferdinand told Carbon Brief on 3 April that while electricity sector data is “relatively good” and despite reasonable proxies being available for transport, there was still a lot of “guesswork” involved at this stage, particularly around the unknown depth and duration of the crisis.

His analysis started by looking at the effect of the 2008-9 global financial crisis, then drew on a mixture of hard data and news reporting of planned measures to extrapolate onto the current situation. He described the effort as a “first impact assessment” that would need to be refined as more data became available. Ferdinand told Carbon Brief on 3 April:

“I’m humble enough to know that I’m wrong. And I think every forecast, in this case, is wrong – unless there is pure luck – because there’s so many unknowns. So I think what we painted here is one potential scenario of what could happen, if the circumstances were as we described them. If the circumstances are different – which we will find out when we get more and more data – then we will need to adjust our analysis.”

Despite all of these challenges, there is plenty of data to draw on that points to significant – though uncertain – changes in CO2 emissions, as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

Estimated impact on global emissions

In order to start building up a global picture of how the pandemic is affecting energy use and emissions, Carbon Brief has been gathering evidence from a wide range of sources.

The information includes direct data, proxy indicators, news reports and third-party forecasts. It covers road-transport demand, aviation, industrial activity, economic output, electricity demand, air pollution, atmospheric carbon and other relevant markers.

In some countries and sectors, notably international aviation, the impact of the current crisis is so severe and dramatic that there can be little doubt it is due to other factors. Even so, a number of assumptions are needed to translate flight cancellations into tonnes of CO2.

Not all of the information can so easily be translated into impacts on emissions. For example, proprietary global traffic data, produced by satnav maker TomTom and tracked by the Financial Times, shows that road use has evaporated in many cities under lockdown. But this city-by-city “congestion index” does not directly correspond with overall transport fuel use.

Similarly, the “truck-toll-mileage index”, published by the German Federal Statistics Office, shows an unprecedented 5.9% monthly fall in goods traffic in March 2020. This only corresponds to one part of German road-transport demand, but also offers a glimpse of the impact on industrial activity.

Ferdinand tells Carbon Brief the index “has a strong correlation with German industry production”, meaning it can provide “some early hints” regarding how economic activity will develop.

So far, five sets of data and existing analysis stand out as offering strong, timely and quantifiable evidence of the coronavirus crisis cutting global CO2 emissions in 2020. These cover the global oil sector, the EU ETS, India’s electricity sector and the entire economies of the US and China.

More detail on all of the pieces of evidence gathered so far will be added to this article over time, with a particular focus on the key countries and sectors highlighted here. (Details of the estimate for China are contained in previously published Carbon Brief analysis; the EU ETS analysis is explained in detail in a report by ICIS analyst Marcus Ferdinand.)

Together, these five areas account for the large majority of annual global CO2 emissions, some three-quarters (76%) of the total in 2018, according to Carbon Brief analysis of data from ICIS and the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2019.

The chart below shows the combined estimated impacts for these five areas in red, alongside an illustrative range (grey bars) showing what a 1, 3 or 5% drop in annual emissions would look like in 2020. Below the dotted line, in blue, are the five largest annual falls ever recorded prior to this year.

As if to emphasise the fast-moving and uncertain nature of the current situation, consultancy Rystad Energy published a significantly updated estimate of the impact on global oil markets on 8 April, after Carbon Brief’s initial analysis had already been finalised.

Whereas the firm had earlier been aligned with the latest US EIA outlook of a roughly 5% decline in oil demand this year, it now expects a much larger 9.4% reduction for the year. Subsequently, on 15 April, the International Energy Agency (IEA) updated its outlook for oil in 2020, such that it now expects a 9.3% decline for the fuel, similar to the forecast from Rystad.

These more dramatic oil-sector forecasts have now been incorporated into Carbon Brief’s analysis. They increase the global oil-sector component of CO2 emissions cuts this year from the 800MtCO2 in Carbon Brief’s initial analysis to 1,300MtCO2.

Carbon Brief’s estimated coronavirus impact on emissions in 2020 is uncertain and incomplete, but amounts to some 2,000MtCO2 this year. This is already roughly 5.5% of global emissions in 2019. (The initial analysis had put the figures at 1,600MtCO2 – 4% of 2019 emissions.)

However, a coronavirus impact equivalent to 5.5% of global emissions will not automatically equate to a 5.5% reduction in 2020. This is because, where possible, the country and sector impact estimates are made relative to “what would have happened without the crisis”.

Pre-crisis estimates of GDP growth suggested CO2 output might rise by around 1% – nearly 500MtCO2 – in 2020. But even if this previously expected growth is deducted from the estimated coronavirus impact, the 2,000MtCO2 effect is so large that it would still result in the largest annual fall in CO2 emissions ever recorded, in records going back to the 18th century.

By way of comparison, the largest annual reduction to date was the 845MtCO2 fall in 1944-45, at the tail-end of the second world war. The decline after the financial crisis of 2008-09 ranks only fifth, at 440MtCO2, and was followed a year later by a stimulus-driven 1,612MtCO2 increase.

To put the potential 2020 coronavirus effect in a broader climate context, it is worth adding that global emissions would need to fall by some 7.6% every year this decade – nearly 2,800MtCO2 in 2020 – in order to limit warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.

(These percentages are taken from the 2019 UNEP gap report, which draws in turn on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report. This found that global emissions in 2030 needed to be 45% below 2010 levels, in order to limit warming to 1.5C.)

Such a rapid rate of annual emissions cuts would be extremely hard to sustain for a decade. The structure of the global economy could continue its slow shift towards lower emissions per unit of GDP – in which case economic output would need to fall by 5% per year. Or GDP could continue to rise if accompanied by rapid and structural shifts towards lower-carbon economies.

If negative emissions technologies are excluded or fail to become available at scale, then the required emissions reductions for 1.5C would be even higher, at 15% every year until 2040.

Even the less stringent 2C limit would require sustained, annual cuts in global emissions of 2.7%, according to UNEP’s gap report, a level equivalent to around 1,000MtCO2 in 2020.

Finally, the nature of the global “carbon budget” means that atmospheric carbon concentrations and global temperatures will continue to rise unless and until annual emissions reach net-zero.

Even if there is a slight decrease in global fossil CO₂ emissions in 2020, the atmospheric concentration of CO₂ will continue to rise.

Even a 10% fall in global fossil-fuel emissions would see some 33,000MtCO2 pumped into the atmosphere in 2020, a higher total than in any year before 2010. Any emissions cuts in 2020 alone will, therefore, have little impact, unless they are followed by longer-lasting changes.

GDP growth and carbon intensity

Carbon Brief’s bottom-up analysis of the emissions impact of the pandemic can be compared with more simplistic estimates based on what has been, to date, the most widespread approach.

These estimates have used the statistical relationship between annual CO2 emissions and the growth in economic output, coupled with revised forecasts for global GDP in 2020.

CO2 emissions and economic output are closely correlated and the ratio of the two – known as the “carbon intensity” of GDP – only changes slowly. When the carbon intensity of GDP is falling, this is often referred to as a “decoupling” of economic growth and emissions.

However, there is little reason to expect the coronavirus crisis to accelerate climate-friendly decoupling, unless post-pandemic recovery efforts make that shift a priority.

Instead, the current crisis may only temporarily cut emissions. Once shuttered factories reopen, commuters get back into their cars and flights once again take to the air, little will have changed in the structure of the global economy – and progress towards net-zero will likely be as slow as ever.

Further issues include that GDP forecasts are inherently uncertain in such an unprecedented crisis and that the economic impacts of the pandemic are highly uneven across sectors, potentially breaking the usual relationship between GDP and emissions.

Ferdinand told Carbon Brief on 3 April that using the statistical relationship between economic output and CO2 emissions for the current crisis was “not the most viable” approach. He said:

“It’s systematically different compared to what we have seen in the past and it’s hitting some sectors much harder than others. I mean it’s disruptive, right, what we see at the moment, and whenever there is disruption in place, it’s difficult to use well-established statistical relationships. Because disruption usually doesn’t care about that.”

Despite all these caveats, there are now a plethora of forecasts of how global GDP growth will be reduced by the crisis, offering a simplistic window into the potential scale of global emissions cuts.

Whereas pre-pandemic forecasts had put global economic growth this year at around 2.5-3%, revised estimates now see GDP rising much more slowly, or even shrinking by as much as 9%.

In early January 2020, for example, the World Bank issued what read at the time as a gloomy projection for the year ahead. It said that “downside risks predominate” and that, as a result, global GDP growth would only reach 2.5% in 2020, up marginally from 2.4% in 2019.

If this forecast had proved accurate, and if the amount of CO2 associated with each unit of GDP had continued to improve in line with recent trends, then global emissions would have risen by some 1.3% to 37.1GtCO2. This would have been an increase of nearly 500MtCO2.

Does a low GDP growth rate (e.g., economic crisis) give a smaller decrease in carbon intensity (CO₂/GDP)?



Not necessarily…

The post-pandemic economic outlook remains extremely uncertain, due to the unknown duration and severity of lockdown controls and doubts over the shape of the recovery.

(Economists describe post-crisis recoveries by the shape of the global GDP trajectory. Most initially expected a “V-shaped” recovery, seen after previous global epidemics, meaning the drop in GDP would be quickly recovered as economies rebound. More prolonged “U-shaped” and “L-shaped” recoveries were initially seen as less likely, but market expectations are shifting.)

Forecasts published in early March have more recently been replaced with far more pessimistic numbers.

On 2 March, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published an “interim economic assessment” saying that global growth might be cut by as little as half a percentage point, to 2.4%, compared with its pre-crisis forecast of 2.9%.

By 26 March, the organisation had dramatically revised its forecast, saying that each month of strict containment measures – ”with no offsetting factors” – would cut the increase in global economic output by around two percentage points.

The OECD said a three-month lockdown could see annual GDP growth some 4-6 percentage points lower than it would otherwise have been. Given its pre-crisis forecast of 2.9% growth in 2020, this could translate into a global economic contraction of up to around 3% for the year.

Similarly, consultancy Oxford Economics said in early March that global GDP growth would be just 0.5 percentage points lower in 2020, at 2.0%, relative to its pre-crisis outlook of 2.5%.

By the time it published a “March/April forecast”, it was expecting 0% growth, described as its “largest-ever forecast revision over two months”. It added that given “huge uncertainty” it also saw potential for the global economy to “enter outright contraction in 2020, with GDP falling 1.3%”.

Based on a range of GDP forecasts available at the time, analysis from the Breakthrough Institute published on 26 March said global emissions might fall by between 0.5% and 2.2% in 2020, shown in the tweet below.

There are huge uncertainties about the impacts of COVID-19 on 2020 CO2 emissions. If forecasts of GDP changes are accurate – and the global economy bounces back in Q3/Q4 2020 – we’d expect declines of 0.5% to 2.2%: https://t.co/OhxGraACPm 1/5 pic.twitter.com/a8zVcxcRyX — Zeke Hausfather (@hausfath) March 26, 2020

However, GDP forecasts have continued to worsen. A 23 March update from the UK-based Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) said the pandemic would cause the “worst economic crisis since the 1930s”, arguing that global GDP would “shrink by at least 4.0% over 2020 before rebounding to growth of 3-4% in 2021”.

The April 2020 edition of the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook puts the contraction in global GDP this year at 3%, pointing to the risk of “even more severe outcomes”. (Notably, it suggests growth will rebound sharply in 2021, with GDP rising 5.8%. This would be likely to mean a large increase in global CO2 emissions next year.)

One of the gloomiest GDP outlooks to date is an 8 April analysis from the World Trade Organization (WTO). It outlines the “wide range of possibilities” for global trade flows, which it says might fall by between 13% and 32% in 2020. The analysis adds:

“WTO economists believe the decline will likely exceed the trade slump brought on by the global financial crisis of 2008‑09. Estimates of the expected recovery in 2021 are equally uncertain, with outcomes depending largely on the duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of the policy responses.”

In its “pessimistic scenario”, the WTO says global GDP could fall by as much as 8.8% in real terms during 2020, before bouncing back with growth of 5.9% in 2021.

Bloomberg says this scenario would be the “most precipitous drop in global commerce since the Great Depression”. It also quotes International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva, saying the world is already in a recession that is “way worse than the global financial crisis”.

A global GDP cut of nearly 9% this year, as outlined by the pessimistic WTO scenario, can be compared with the 1.7% contraction in the wake of the global financial crisis.

Based only on the historical relationship between GDP and CO2, this would translate into a near-10% cut in CO2 emissions in 2020 – a fall of more than 3,600MtCO2 – which is more than double the 2,000MtCO2 figure from Carbon Brief’s bottom-up analysis."
Minimum wage workers cannot afford rent in any U.S. state,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/minimum-wage-workers-cannot-afford-rent-in-any-us-state.html,"Full-time minimum wage workers cannot afford a two-bedroom rental anywhere in the U.S. and cannot afford a one-bedroom rental in 95% of U.S. counties, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's annual ""Out of Reach"" report. In fact, the average minimum wage worker in the U.S. would need to work almost 97 hours per week to afford a fair market rate two-bedroom and 79 hours per week to afford a one-bedroom, NLIHC calculates. That's well over two full-time jobs just to be able to afford a two-bedroom rental.

National Low Income Housing Coalition

The report, released Tuesday, defines ""affordable"" as spending no more than 30% of monthly income on rent, in line with what most budgeting experts recommend. Nationally, NLIHC puts the ""housing wage"" for 2020 — or what a full-time worker must make in order to afford a fair market rental without spending more than 30% of his or her income — at $23.96 per hour for a two-bedroom rental and $19.56 per hour for a one-bedroom. That means even the average hourly worker who earns $18.22 per hour cannot afford rent, the report says. Many workers deemed essential during the coronavirus pandemic earn even less. ""Grocery store cashiers earn a median wage of $11.61 per hour, while building cleaning workers and home health and personal care aides earn $12.94,"" per NLIHC.

"Recycling was a lie — a big lie — to sell more plastic, industry experts say",https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-passionate-eye/recycling-was-a-lie-a-big-lie-to-sell-more-plastic-industry-experts-say-1.5735618,"Although our landfills and oceans are full of it, we are as dependent as ever on plastic. And since COVID-19, it's gotten worse.

Last year, Canada announced it was working on a ban of single-use plastics, which was initally sidelined by the pandemic. Recently, the government announced that many single-use plastics will be banned by the end of 2021. At the same time, CBC News reports our single-use plastic use increased by 250 to 300 per cent as people tossed their personal protective equipment and stopped using reusable bags and containers over fears they would spread the virus.

What makes our lives convenient is also burying us. Plastic Wars, presented by The Passionate Eye, looks at the mounting crisis and how the industry has spent millions promoting recycling — just to sell more plastic.

Less than 10% of the plastics we've used have been recycled

Although activists sounded the alarm about plastic waste in the 1970s, the documentary claims from 1990 to 2010, plastic production more than doubled. We've been sorting our trash for decades, believing it would be recycled. But the truth is the vast majority of the plastic we use won't be. Over the last seven decades, less than 10 per cent of plastic waste has been recycled.

That's because, says David Allaway, from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the conversation has been almost exclusively about recycling and not reducing and reusing.

Plastic Wars: Recycling 1:06 Even as the plastic crisis worsens, the demand for plastic grows and plastic production is rapidly expanding. One issue? Only focusing on recycling, and not reducing the amount of plastic that we use. 1:06

Recycling logo was used as a green marketing tool, says industry expert

In the '80s, the industry was at the centre of an environmental backlash. Fearing an outright ban on plastics, manufacturers looked for ways to get ahead of the problem. They looked at recycling as a way to improve the image of their product and started labeling plastics with the now ubiquitous chasing-arrows symbol with a number inside.

According to Ronald Liesemer, an industry veteran who was tasked with overseeing the new initiative, ""Making recycling work was a way to keep their products in the marketplace.""

Most consumers might have assumed the symbol meant the product was recyclable. But according to experts in the film, there was no economically viable way to recycle most plastics, and they have ultimately ended up in a landfill. This included plastic films, bags and the wrapping around packaged goods, as well as containers like margarine tubs.

""Our own customers … they would flat out say, 'It says it's recyclable right on it,'"" says Coy Smith, former board member of the National Recycling Coalition. ""And I'd be like, 'I can tell you, I can't give this away. There's no one that would even take it if I paid them to take it.'"" He believes manufacturers used the symbol as a green marketing tool.

""If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they're not going to be as concerned about the environment,"" says Larry Thomas, another top industry official interviewed in Plastic Wars.

According to Lewis Freeman, a former vice-president with the Society of the Plastics Industry, many in the industry had doubts about recycling from the start. ""There was never an enthusiastic belief that recycling was ultimately going to work in a significant way,"" he says.

Yet the plastic industry spent millions on ads selling plastics and recycling to consumers.

Lots of our plastic was shipped to China, then Southeast Asia, for 'recycling'

To solve the plastic waste problem, many recyclers started selling their product to China in the 1990s. According to recycling broker Sunil Bagaria, China took waste that North American recyclers couldn't use. ""As long as it remotely resembled plastic, they wanted it,"" he says.

But they used the good stuff and disposed of the rest. And because of a growing plastic waste problem in that country, China finally stopped taking most imported plastic waste in 2018.

""We never asked the question, 'Are they doing it the right way? Are we damaging the environment more in the name of recycling?'"" says Bagaria.

Now, Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia have picked up the plastic waste market. And although some North American plastics recyclers are following up to ensure their products are in fact being recycled, plastic waste is now a growing problem there, too.

In Plastic Wars, local activist Yuyan Ismawati visits a rural community where locals scour through a huge field of plastic waste for items of value and burn the rest. This creates health problems for the residents in addition to destroying the surrounding environment. ""We are struggling to clean up the modern debris and modern litter in Indonesia, the additional burden of waste from overseas — I don't know how we are going to handle it,"" says Ismawati. ""Americans need to know that your waste ended up here.""

Production of plastics expected to triple by 2050

In 2020, roughly 60 years after concerns about plastic waste were first raised, the focus is still on the consumer to recycle, says Allaway, and not on the environmental impact of the product and overproduction by the industry.

Plastic Wars: Full Impact 1:56 Consumers are constantly told that they should do their part to reduce plastic waste, but in reality, consumers have the lowest amount of leverage in reducing waste - it's plastic producers that should be reporting their full environmental impacts. 1:56

According to Plastic Wars the problem is only going to get worse. By 2050, it's estimated the global production of plastic will triple. As the oil and gas industry — which provides the source materials for plastics — faces a future of declining demand for fuel, it has turned to other markets.

The stakes are high, says Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA. ""This is their lifeline,"" she says. ""They are going to double down on single-use plastic like we have never seen. So we're heading towards a real battle.... This is the big war.""

"Qantas offers a seven-hour flight to nowhere - for $1,000+ you too can fly in circles over Australia, both watching it burn AND accelerating planetary death",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/flights-to-nowhere-qantas/index.html,"(CNN) — Pre-pandemic, many of us viewed flying simply as a method of getting from one destination to another as quickly as possible.

But amid global restrictions, travelers have been daydreaming not only about far-flung destinations, but the flying experience itself -- from the thrill of the take-off to the unmatched views of the Earth from the cabin window.

That's where ""flights to nowhere"" come in -- air travel that takes place purely for the purpose of the journey, not the destination.

Proving how popular these now are, a sightseeing flight to nowhere offered by Qantas sold out within 10 minutes, according to the airline, with passengers eager to take to the skies at at time when Australia has grounded almost all international flights paying premium prices.

""It's probably the fastest selling flight in Qantas history,"" the airline's CEO, Alan Joyce, said in a statement.

""People clearly miss travel and the experience of flying. If the demand is there, we'll definitely look at doing more of these scenic flights while we all wait for borders to open.""

The seven-hour scenic flight will perform a giant loop taking in Queensland and the Gold Coast, New South Wales and the country's remote outback heartlands.

From above, keen fliers should be able to spot famous Aussie attractions including Sydney Harbour and the Great Barrier Reef. The jet will do a low flyover over certain landmarks, including Uluru and Bondi Beach.

Special onboard entertainment is promised too, including a surprise celebrity host.

The journey will take place on a Qantas Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, usually reserved for intercontinental journeys across continents. Right now, there are very few flights operating to and from Australia due to travel restrictions and Qantas international fleet has been grounded.

The Dreamliner is renowned for its big windows, making it ideal for sightseeing from 30,000 feet.

Flight QF787, due to depart Sydney Domestic Airport on October 10 and return to the Australian metropolis seven hours later, had 134 tickets on sale -- spanning business class, premium economy and economy and costing from AUD$787 to $3,787 (US$566 to $2,734).

New trend

Across Asia, where the majority of borders remain closed, limiting leisure tourism, there have been a spate of recent flights with no destination.

Qantas' flight follows on the heels of EVA Air's Taiwan-based flight to nowhere , which offered a one-off journey on August 8, on board its Hello Kitty-themed A330 Dream jet.

Meanwhile All Nipon Airways (ANA) also operated a short scenic flight in Japan in August , which the airline said sought to replicate ""the Hawaiian resort experience,"" with 300 travelers boarding the 1.5 hour flight.

And on September 19, a scenic flight is due to depart Taipei Airport, offering 120 Taiwanese tourists the opportunity to view South Korea's Jeju island from the sky.

The journey is due to be an experience in itself, according to the Korea Tourism Organization's press release, offering an in-flight quiz show and local cuisine.

Singapore Airlines is also reportedly considering operating flights to nowhere from October, according to the local Straits Times newspaper

A spokesperson for Singapore Airlines told CNN Travel that the airline ""is considering several initiatives that would allow us to continue engaging both our customers and members of the public. Currently, none of these plans have been firmed up.""

From an environmental perspective, the proposal of a flight to nowhere is potentially contentious.

But while there might be concerns about unnecessary fuel usage, Covid-19 worries might be mitigated by recent scientific studies that suggest the odds of catching Covid on an airplane are less than you might think, due to the air ventilation systems."
World's richest 1% cause double CO2 emissions of poorest 50%,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/worlds-richest-1-cause-double-co2-emissions-of-poorest-50-says-oxfam,"The wealthiest 1% of the world’s population were responsible for the emission of more than twice as much carbon dioxide as the poorer half of the world from 1990 to 2015, according to new research.

Carbon dioxide emissions rose by 60% over the 25-year period, but the increase in emissions from the richest 1% was three times greater than the increase in emissions from the poorest half.

The report, compiled by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute, warned that rampant overconsumption and the rich world’s addiction to high-carbon transport are exhausting the world’s “carbon budget”.

Such a concentration of carbon emissions in the hands of the rich means that despite taking the world to the brink of climate catastrophe, through burning fossil fuels, we have still failed to improve the lives of billions, said Tim Gore, head of policy, advocacy and research at Oxfam International.

“The global carbon budget has been squandered to expand the consumption of the already rich, rather than to improve humanity,” he told the Guardian. “A finite amount of carbon can be added to the atmosphere if we want to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. We need to ensure that carbon is used for the best.”

The richest 10% of the global population, comprising about 630 million people, were responsible for about 52% of global emissions over the 25-year period, the study showed.

Globally, the richest 10% are those with incomes above about $35,000 (£27,000) a year, and the richest 1% are people earning more than about $100,000.

Carbon dioxide emissions accumulate in the atmosphere, causing heating, and temperature rises of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would cause widespread harm to natural systems. That accumulation gives the world a finite carbon budget of how much carbon dioxide it is safe to produce, which scientists warn will be exhausted within a decade at current rates.

If left unchecked, in the next decade the carbon emissions of the world’s richest 10% would be enough to raise levels above the point likely to increase temperatures by 1.5C, even if the whole of the rest of the world cut their emissions to zero immediately, according to Monday’s report.

Oxfam argues that continuing to allow the rich world to emit vastly more than those in poverty is unfair. While the world moves towards renewable energy and phases out fossil fuels, any emissions that continue to be necessary during the transition would be better used in trying to improve poor people’s access to basic amenities.

“The best possible, morally defensible purpose is for all humanity to live a decent life, but [the carbon budget] has been used up by the already rich, in getting richer,” said Gore.

He pointed to transport as one of the key drivers of growth in emissions, with people in rich countries showing an increasing tendency to drive high-emitting cars, such as SUVs, and take more flights. Oxfam wants more taxes on high-carbon luxuries, such as a frequent-flyer levy, to funnel investment into low-carbon alternatives and improving the lot of the poor.

“This isn’t about people who have one family holiday a year, but people who are taking long-haul flights every month – it’s a fairly small group of people,” said Gore.

While the coronavirus crisis caused a temporary dip in emissions, the overall impact on the carbon budget is likely to be negligible, according to Gore, as emissions have rebounded after lockdowns around the world. However, the experience of dealing with the pandemic should make people more aware of the need to try to avert future catastrophe, he said.

Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: “This is a stark illustration of the deep injustice at the heart of the climate crisis. Those who are so much more exposed and vulnerable to its impacts have done least to contribute to the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing it. The UK has a moral responsibility here, not only because of its disproportionately high historic emissions, but as hosts of next year’s critical UN climate summit. We need to go further and faster in reaching net zero.”

World governments are meeting virtually for the 75th UN general assembly this week, with the climate crisis high on the agenda. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, is expected to set out his vision for the next UN climate summit, called Cop26 and to be convened in Glasgow in November 2021, after the coronavirus crisis forced a year’s delay to the event.

As host nation, the UK government is being urged to set out its plans for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, a target enshrined in law last year, but for which there are still few national policies."
‘Collapse of civilisation is the most likely outcome’: top climate scientists,https://voiceofaction.org/collapse-of-civilisation-is-the-most-likely-outcome-top-climate-scientists/,"The world’s most eminent climate scientists and biologists believe we’re headed for the collapse of civilisation, and it may already be too late to change course.

Australia’s top climate scientist says “we are already deep into the trajectory towards collapse” of civilisation, which may now be inevitable because 9 of the 15 known global climate tipping points that regulate the state of the planet have been activated.

Australian National University emeritus professor Will Steffen (pictured) told Voice of Action that there was already a chance we have triggered a “global tipping cascade” that would take us to a less habitable “Hothouse Earth” climate, regardless of whether we reduced emissions.

Steffen says it would take 30 years at best (more likely 40-60 years) to transition to net zero emissions, but when it comes to tipping points such as Arctic sea ice we could have already run out of time.

Evidence shows we will also lose control of the tipping points for the Amazon rainforest, the West Antarctic ice sheet, and the Greenland ice sheet in much less time than it’s going to take us to get to net zero emissions, Steffen says.

“Given the momentum in both the Earth and human systems, and the growing difference between the ‘reaction time’ needed to steer humanity towards a more sustainable future, and the ‘intervention time’ left to avert a range of catastrophes in both the physical climate system (e.g., melting of Arctic sea ice) and the biosphere (e.g., loss of the Great Barrier Reef), we are already deep into the trajectory towards collapse,” said Steffen.

“That is, the intervention time we have left has, in many cases, shrunk to levels that are shorter than the time it would take to transition to a more sustainable system.

“The fact that many of the features of the Earth System that are being damaged or lost constitute ‘tipping points’ that could well link to form a ‘tipping cascade’ raises the ultimate question: Have we already lost control of the system? Is collapse now inevitable?”

This is not a unique view – leading Stanford University biologists, who were first to reveal that we are already experiencing the sixth mass extinction on Earth, released new research this week showing species extinctions are accelerating in an unprecedented manner, which may be a tipping point for the collapse of human civilisation.

Also in the past week research emerged showing the world’s major food baskets will experience more extreme droughts than previously forecast, with southern Australia among the worst hit globally.

Steffen used the metaphor of the Titanic in one of his recent talks to describe how we may cross tipping points faster than the time it would take us to react to get our impact on the climate under control.

“If the Titanic realises that it’s in trouble and it has about 5km that it needs to slow and steer the ship, but it’s only 3km away from the iceberg, it’s already doomed,” he said.

‘This is an existential threat to civilization’

Steffen, along with some of the world’s most eminent climate scientists, laid out our predicament in the starkest possible terms in a piece for the journal Nature at the end of last year.

They found that 9 of the 15 known Earth tipping elements that regulate the state of the planet had been activated, and there was now scientific support for declaring a state of planetary emergency. These tipping points can trigger abrupt carbon release back into the atmosphere, such as the release of carbon dioxide and methane caused by the irreversible thawing of the Arctic permafrost.

9 of 15 known Earth tipping points have been activated

“If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a global tipping point cannot be ruled out, then this is an existential threat to civilization,” they wrote.

“No amount of economic cost–benefit analysis is going to help us. We need to change our approach to the climate problem.

“The evidence from tipping points alone suggests that we are in a state of planetary emergency: both the risk and urgency of the situation are acute.”

Steffen is also the lead author of the heavily cited 2018 paper, Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene, where he found that “even if the Paris Accord target of a 1.5°C to 2°C rise in temperature is met, we cannot exclude the risk that a cascade of feedbacks could push the Earth System irreversibly onto a ‘Hothouse Earth’ pathway.”

Steffen is a global authority on the subject of tipping points, which are prone to sudden shifts if they get pushed hard enough by a changing climate, and could take the trajectory of the system out of human control. Further warming would become self-sustaining due to system feedbacks and their mutual interaction.

Steffen describes it like a row of dominos and his concern is we are already at the point of no return, knocking over the first couple of dominos which could lead to a cascade knocking over the whole row.

“Some of these we think are vulnerable in the temperature range we’re entering into now,” said Steffen.

“If we get those starting to tip we could get the whole row of dominos tipping and take us to a much hotter climate even if we get our emissions down.”

Even the notoriously conservative United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that already with the 1.1°C of warming we have had to date, there was a moderate risk of tipping some of these – and the risk increased as the temperatures increased.

Steffen believes we are committed to at least a 1.5°C temperature rise given the momentum in the economic and climate system, but we still have a shot at staying under 2°C with urgent action.

+4°C world would support < 1 billion people

Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director emeritus and founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, believes if we go much above 2°C we will quickly get to 4°C anyway because of the tipping points and feedbacks, which would spell the end of human civilisation.

“There is a very big risk that we will just end our civilisation”: Professor Schellnhuber

Johan Rockström, the head of one of Europe’s leading research institutes, warned in 2019 that in a 4°C-warmer world it would be “difficult to see how we could accommodate a billion people or even half of that … There will be a rich minority of people who survive with modern lifestyles, no doubt, but it will be a turbulent, conflict-ridden world”.

Schellnhuber, one of the world’s leading authorities on climate change, said that if we continue down the present path “there is a very big risk that we will just end our civilisation. The human species will survive somehow but we will destroy almost everything we have built up over the last two thousand years.”

Schellnhuber said in a recent interview that the IPCC report stating we could stay below 1.5°C of warming was “slightly dishonest” because it relies on immense negative emissions (pulling CO2 out of the air) which was not viable at global scale. He said 1.5°C was no longer achievable but it was still possible to stay under 2°C with massive changes to society.

If we don’t bend the emissions curve down substantially before 2030 then keeping temperatures under 2°C becomes unavoidable. The “carbon law” published in the journal Science in 2017 found that, to hold warming below 2°C, emissions would need to be cut in half between 2020 and 2030.

Steffen told Voice of Action that the three main challenges to humanity – climate change, the degradation of the biosphere and the growing inequalities between and among countries – were “just different facets of the same fundamental problem”.

This problem was the “neoliberal economic system” that spread across the world through globalisation, underpinning “high production high consumption lifestyles” and a “religion built not around eternal life but around eternal growth”.

“It is becoming abundantly clear that (i) this system is incompatible with a well-functioning Earth System at the planetary level; (ii) this system is eroding human- and societal-well being, even in the wealthiest countries, and (iii) collapse is the most likely outcome of the present trajectory of the current system, as prophetically modelled in 1972 in the Limits to Growth work,” Steffen told Voice of Action.

Eternal growth is not possible

The Limits to Growth model released by the Club of Rome in 1972 looked at the interplay between food production, industry, population, non-renewable resources and pollution.

The basic findings were that you can’t grow the system indefinitely as you will cause environmental and resource issues that will ultimately cause the whole global system to collapse (ABC’s This Day Tonight program covered it here). At the time of the model’s release it accurately reproduced the historical data from 1900 to 1970.

A 2008 study by Graham Turner, then a senior CSIRO research scientist, used three decades of real-world historical data to conclude that the Limits to Growth model’s predictions were coming to pass: “30 years of historical data compare favourably with key features of a business-as-usual [BAU] scenario called the ‘standard run’ scenario, which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st century.”

Former CSIRO scientist Graham Turner has been warning about collapse for decades

Turner ran updated figures through the model again in 2012 for another peer-reviewed paper, and again in 2014 when he had joined the University of Melbourne’s Sustainable Society Institute.

“Data from the forty years or so since the LTG study was completed indicates that the world is closely tracking the BAU scenario,” Turner concluded in the 2014 paper.

“It is notable that there does not appear to be other economy-environment models that have demonstrated such comprehensive and long-term data agreement.”

Turner semi-retired in 2015 but runs a small organic market garden on a rural property in the NSW south coast’s Bega Valley.

He and his wife grow most of their own food and live off grid powered by a solar energy system. Turner said this saved him during last summer’s catastrophic bushfires as his power stayed online but most people in the area lost power for weeks.

Turner has continued tracking the data as best as possible since his last official report in 2014, and last year he helped a Harvard masters student update the data for their thesis.

Turner told Voice of Action that under his modelling the business as usual scenario “ends up resulting in a global collapse from about now through the next decade or so”.

It was difficult to predict a timeline but Turner said he believed “there’s an extremely strong case that we may be in the early stages of a collapse right at the moment”.

“Vested interests and corrupt politicians combined with a population happy to deny problems overwhelm those that are trying to promulgate truth and facts,” said Turner.

Fossil fuel emissions continue to rise

‘By 2030 we’ll know what path we’ve taken’

Steffen told Voice of Action that it’s “highly likely that by 2030 we’ll know what pathway we’ve taken”, “the pathway towards sustainability or the current pathway towards likely collapse”.

“I think the ‘fork in the road’ will come in this decade, probably not a single point in time but as a series of events,” said Steffen.

Steffen told Voice of Action he believes collapse “will likely not come as a dramatic global collapse, but rather as overall deterioration in many features of life, with regional collapses occurring here and there”.

“For example, it appears that the USA is entering a long period of decline in many aspect of its society, with a potential for a more rapid collapse in the coming decade,” said Steffen.

Samuel Alexander, a lecturer with the University of Melbourne and research fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, told Voice of Action that the coming collapse would not be a single black or white event.

“With respect to civilisations, what is more likely is that we have entered a stage of what JM Greer calls ‘catabolic collapse’ – where we face decades of ongoing crises, as the existing mode of civilisation deteriorates, but then recovers as governments and civil society tries to respond, and fix things, and keep things going for a bit longer,” said Alexander.

“Capitalism is quite good at dodging bullets and escaping temporary challenges to its legitimacy and viability. But its condition, I feel is terminal.”

Alexander, who studies the economic, political and cultural challenges of living on a full planet in an age of limits, believes the future will be “post-growth / post capitalist / post-industrial in some form”.

“The future will like arrive in part by design and in part by disaster. Our challenge is to try to constitute the future through planning and community action, not have the future constitute us,” said Alexander.

Alexander said that it would never be “too late” to act sensibly as whether we’re trying to avoid or manage collapse there is lots of work to be done (“a 3 degree future is better than a 4 degree future”).

Steffen believes the current US mass uprisings are not a sign of collapse but one of “growing instability”.

Alexander said it was a sign of “steam building up within a closed system”. Without bold grassroots and political action we were “likely to see explosions of civil unrest increasingly as things continue to deteriorate”.

“As economies deteriorate and as inequalities deepen, more people get disenfranchised, incentivising resistance and sadly sometimes making people look for scapegoats to blame for new or intensifying hardships (e.g. the so-called alt-right),” said Alexander.

If we don’t stabilise the climate we will fall into an irreversible Hothouse Earth scenario

Funding dried up after inconvenient truths

When Turner joined CSIRO in the early 2000s the organisation was working on the Australian Stocks and Flows Framework – a model of the economy using physical things rather than dollars.

The work was funded by the Department of Immigration but Turner says the reports – the last of which was done in 2010 – were buried because the conclusions did not support high population growth.

The research found the economic benefits in terms of wealth per person would be outweighed by social ills including the impact on quality of life and the environment from resource use and pollution. The reports warned there would be nil net flow to the Darling River, loss of habitat and animal and plant species, traffic congestion, city water deficits and reduced biodiversity due to polluted creeks.

Turner’s findings went against the neoliberal orthodoxies as they challenged the notion of infinite growth on a finite planet. He said he and others pursuing similar research in “stocks and flows” models of the economy “found it harder and harder to get work funded”.

It is no wonder then that the latest Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration report found “there is no literature that synthesises the large scale impacts that climate change could have on Australia’s economy, and no reliable snapshot of Australia’s economic vulnerability to future climate warming in a regional and global context”.

Steffen said he hadn’t received any political pressure over his work “but I probably haven’t attacked the growth/capitalism paradigm as directly as Graham [Turner] has”. He says he has not hesitated to note the incompatibility of the neoliberal economic system with a stable Earth system in his talks.

“It seems obvious that very fundamental changes are required, all the way down to core values – what do we really value in life?,” said Steffen.

Turner said the “absolutely immense changes” required to deliver a sustainable future were just “too hard for the vast majority of people to contemplate”.

“You’d have to halve the birth rate, you’d have to have net zero immigration, you’d have to go totally renewable energy and double efficiencies in every sector of the economy, and the really key thing is you’d have to reduce the working week over time so that it would become half of what it is,” said Turner.

“But that would also mean that people wouldn’t have the same level of income and it goes hand in hand with reducing household consumption by half. And unless you do all of those things, you don’t achieve a steady state, sustainable future, and if you leave some things out you’ve got to go even harder at the others.”

Turner believes it would be possible to provide for everyone’s needs in a sustainable way but we would have to live a 1950s or 1960s-style lifestyle with limits such as one car and TV per household. We wouldn’t be living in caves and we’d still have technology but the rate of change would be a lot slower.

“I think if we all manage to live a simpler and arguably more fulfilling life then it would be possible still with some technological advances to have a sustainable future, but it would seem that it’s more likely … that we are headed towards or perhaps on the cusp of a sort of global collapse,” Turner told Voice of Action.

Turner said he fears that the public at large won’t take the problem seriously enough and demand change until they’re “actually losing their jobs or losing their life or seeing their children directly suffer”.

‘Potentially infinite costs of climate change’

The political discourse is about getting back to growth, supported by taxpayer-subsidised fossil fuels, but evidence shows that even if the government was committed to renewable energy, “green growth” is just not possible at a global scale.

A 2019 IMF Working Paper notes a growing agreement between economists and scientists “that risk of catastrophic and irreversible disaster is rising, implying potentially infinite costs of unmitigated climate change, including, in the extreme, human extinction”.

Slide from Steffen’s recent presentation showed the temperature anomaly over 2000 years

The Australian-based Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration has spent years publishing reports warning that the science shows we are headed for civilisational collapse. They stress there is no further carbon budget today for a realistic chance of staying below 2°C, so there can be no further fossil fuel expansion.

The Breakthrough reports have been critical of the scientific community – including the IPCC – for underplaying the full risks of climate change particularly the tipping points and existential risk. Its latest report, Fatal Calculations, takes aim at economists for failing to adequately account for costs of inaction in their models, which in turn has been used by politicians to delay action.

“Despite the escalating climate disasters globally, not least our bushfires, this preoccupation with the cost of action — and a blind eye turned to overwhelming future damage — remains the dominant thinking within politics, business and finance,” the Breakthrough report found.

“Because climate change is now an existential threat to human society, risk management and the calculation of potential future damages must pay disproportionate attention to the high-end, extreme possibilities, rather than focus on middle-of-the-spectrum probabilities.”

In a discussion paper released in May, titled COVID-19 climate lessons, Breakthrough draws parallels between climate change and the lack of preparedness for the pandemic.

“The world is sleepwalking towards disaster. The UN climate science and policymaking institutions are not fit-for-purpose and have never examined or reported on the existential risks,” the paper reads.

“There are no national or global processes to ensure that such risk assessments are undertaken and are efficacious. The World Economic Forum reports on high-end global risks, including climate disruption, once a year and then everybody goes back to ignoring the real risks.”

Tipping points are poorly accounted for in climate change models

Human activity is causing temperature rises beyond the envelope of natural variability that the biosphere is built to support. Steffen said there’s only been two times in the last 100 million years that we have seen a spike in temperature like this, the first was when the dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago and the second was another mass extinction event 56 million years ago.

The last time atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions were at the current level was during the early-to-mid Pliocene 3–4 million years ago, when temperatures were around 3°C warmer than the late 19th century, and sea levels were around 25 metres higher.

Government failing to meet the challenge

Despite recent bushfires which burnt 35 million hectares, caused 445 excess deaths from smoke and incinerated 1 billion animals – doubling Australia’s annual CO2 emissions in the process – the government is refusing to commit to even modest emissions reduction targets and is pushing a “gas-fired recovery”.

It has emerged this week that the government was warned about the likelihood of severe bushfires but failed to do enough to prepare. Fire chiefs were also gagged from talking about climate change.

The Great Barrier Reef this year was hit with its third mass bleaching event in 5 years.

The Australian government, beholden to the fossil fuel industry and with no corruption watchdog to keep it in check, continues to resist pressure to increase its climate change commitment. Australia will not even be able to meet its Paris targets without an accounting loophole – targets which themselves are inadequate to prevent collapse.

It’s not just climate change that is leading us to collapse but also the fact that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history.

Around 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many within decades. As Steffen notes, the web of life on Earth is getting smaller and increasingly frayed.

Humans thoroughly dominate the land biosphere making up 32% of all terrestrial biomass followed by around 65% in domesticated animals, leaving less than 3% of vertebrate wildlife.

There has also been what’s called “The Great Acceleration”, whereby human population and economic growth is accelerating leading to accelerating use of resources like water and energy. This has also led to exponential growth in: greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, surface temperatures, marine fish capture, terrestrial biosphere degradation, tropical forest lost and domesticated land.

Many countries, including parts of Australia, are running out of water and having to truck in bottled water. It is predicted that 1.8 billion people will be living in water-scarce regions by 2025.

Steffen says net zero emissions by 2050 would be “too late” and the only thing that will save us are radical solutions committing to:

No new fossil fuel developments of any kind from now

A 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 100% renewable energy

Reaching net zero emissions by 2040

Steffen says it’s much, much cheaper not to use fossil fuels in the first place than to try to capture the CO2 after the fact, as you’re “fighting the second law of thermodynamics when you’re trying to recapture CO2”.

Turner believes the Corporations Act should be rewritten “so that corporations don’t have more legal rights than people, and are not compelled to make a profit for shareholders”.

‘We’re possibly gone already’

Associate Professor Anitra Nelson, honorary principal fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, advocates for “de-growth” policies which would reduce global consumption and production to sustainable levels. She says we’re currently consuming resources as if there were four Earths and if we don’t change fast we will face conditions that we can’t survive under.

‘Time for degrowth’: Anitra Nelson

“On the current trajectory we’re possibly gone already, and if we’re not, unless we act very quickly and in very serious ways we just can’t get back into a kind of balance with nature,” Nelson told Voice of Action.

“I do actually think we’re already into the collapse and it’s just likely to get worse and more quickly worse as we go.”

Nelson said we have to wholesale change how we live on this planet and that includes discussions about population control (such as restrictions on the number of kids people have) and even maximum income limits.

Nelson said we also need to get rid of capitalism as fundamentally that economic system could not survive without growth.

Instead of firms competing in a global market we need to be “localising economies” so that “basically people are producing locally for local needs and only basic needs”. This would involve having “autonomous communities” with “substantive and direct democracy” and consensus decision making.

Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), told Voice of Action that our economic model “will have to change or collapse” as “we are reaching the limits to growth”. The health and social costs were increasingly evident and “we are getting to the point where it can’t be avoided”.

“I think global capitalism is realising that the parasitical nature that has emerged (where the top 1% own the vast majority of the world’s wealth), can only be sustained for so long,” said Buckley.

“If they kill the host (the bottom 99% of the people), their position in absolute terms is worse off, even if they own all the wealth, the total pie will shrink, and they are most impacted. So in order to protect their ‘elite’ position, they will allow changes to make the model more sustainable, so they can remain the top 1%, but sharing a little more to make the model more sustainable.”

Buckley is more optimistic than most in that he believes the world’s financial elites will reorganise the global economy to become sustainable out of self preservation.

“The economics of renewables make this economically sensible. It is not about saving the poor of the world. It is about an economic reality – solar is killing coal fired power plant investments. Technology and economics win, not environmentalism.”"
"Good news everyone: David Koch, billionaire businessman and influential GOP donor, dies",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/politics/david-koch-dead/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Conservative billionaire David Koch, who became a household name through the policy and political empire he created with his older brother, Charles, has died. He was 79.

Charles Koch, the CEO of the family's industrial conglomerate Koch Industries, announced the death Friday.

""It is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of my brother David. Anyone who worked with David surely experienced his giant personality and passion for life,"" the elder Koch said in a statement. The statement did not cite a cause of death but noted David Koch's decades-old battle with prostate cancer. He is survived by his wife Julia and their three children.

Koch retired from the company and the Koch political operations in 2018 , citing health reasons. Sources close to the family told CNN he had been in declining health in recent weeks.

The Koch brothers were best known -- and vilified by Democrats -- for their role in politics, and they used their vast wealth to build a sprawling array of think tanks, foundations and political groups to spread their small-government, free-market message. In some elections, the Koch network rivaled the spending and scope of the national Republican Party, and analysts view their activism as helping to have fueled the Tea Party movement.

Koch's death is not expected to bring major changes to the network founded by Charles Koch and now overseen on a day-to-day basis by his top lieutenant Brian Hooks.

The organization already was in midst of transformation when David Koch stepped away from his formal roles. The Koch groups now are called Stand Together and have made more investments in philanthropy and policy issues, such as K-12 education.

David Koch was most active in Americans for Prosperity, the grassroots arm of the Koch's sprawling network, which built a coalition of more than 3 million activists to push the agenda of the Kochs and the roughly 700 like-minded donors to help fund their public policy work.

In June, Americans for Prosperity announced four new political action committees and said it would wade into primaries to help incumbent politicians, including Democrats, who side with Koch on trade, immigration and other issues.

David Koch himself entered politics decades ago, waging an unsuccessful bid as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 1980 with Ed Clark. They won just 1% of the vote.

The Koch network has spread a hardline, limited-government message that has helped move the GOP to the right in recent years, as they bankrolled efforts to elect conservatives to Congress and statehouses around the country.

David Koch, instantly recognizable in any crowd at 6-feet-5-inches, was the more affable and public face of the duo, while Charles Koch, who still lives in the compound where they were raised in Wichita, was the driving force behind the company and the brothers' political activism.

""I think (David Koch) would like to be seen as a philanthropist in the traditional sense,"" said Daniel Schulman, the author of the 2014 book about the brothers' rise, ""Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America's Most Powerful and Private Dynasty.""

""But his legacy is intertwined with his very robust role in politics and the political culture,"" he added. The brothers' work to boost the Tea Party wave in the 2010 election ""is a precursor to the politically fractious era we are living in,"" Schulman said.

Their activism made them villains to Democrats; then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, once denounced them as ""power-drunk billionaires"" out ""to buy the country."" But it also put them at odds with Trump, who called them a ""total joke"" last year after Charles Koch and his top lieutenants publicly criticized the administration's trade policies.

Even so, the Kochs have close ties to key figures in the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who represented Wichita in the US House.

Pompeo on Friday tweeted his condolences, calling David Koch ""a compassionate philanthropist, successful businessman, and a proud American.""

David Koch was born on May 3, 1940 to Fred Koch -- an ultra-conservative businessman who was a founding member of the John Birch Society -- and Mary Koch.

David was one of four Koch brothers: Frederick, the oldest; Charles; and William, David's fraternal twin.

Charles, who was groomed at a young age to take over the family's oil business, and David prevailed in a years-long feud with Frederick and William to retain control of a company that would become one of the country's largest industrial empires.

The two brothers largely made their fortune through Koch Industries, an industrial conglomerate and one of the world's largest private companies, the company is engaged in everything from oil refining to making consumer products such as Brawny paper towels. In March, Forbes listed both Koch brothers as the 11th wealthiest men in the world, with an estimated individual worth of $50.5 billion.

As philanthropists, the brothers' mission expanded to include large donations to colleges and universities as well as advocating for criminal justice reform. They also dedicated funds toward medical research and the arts.

David Koch, a well-known figure in New York, became a major benefactor of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a patron to arts organizations. A dance-focused theater at Lincoln Center bears his name, courtesy of his $100 million pledge in 2008. Last year, Koch Industries said David Koch's donations and pledges to philanthropic organizations had topped $1.3 billion.

""Twenty-seven years ago, David was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given a grim prognosis of a few years to live,"" Charles Koch said in Friday's statement. ""David liked to say that a combination of brilliant doctors, state-of-the-art medications and his own stubbornness kept the cancer at bay. We can all be grateful that it did, because he was able to touch so many more lives as a result."""

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The mayor of Portland, Oregon was tear-gassed by U.S. government agents as he stood outside a federal courthouse during another night of protests against the presence of federal police sent by President Donald Trump to quell the city’s ongoing unrest.

Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, appeared slightly dazed and coughed and said Wednesday night it was the first time he’d been tear-gassed.

He put on a pair of goggles someone handed him and drank water but did not leave his spot at the front of the protest and continued to take tear gas as the demonstration raged — with protesters lighting a large fire between protective fencing and the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse amid the pop-pop-pop sounds of the federal agents deploying tear gas and stun grenades into the crowd.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the agents knew Wheeler was among those in crowd when they used the tear gas.

Earlier in the night, Wheeler was mostly jeered as he tried to rally demonstrators who have clashed nightly with federal agents but was briefly applauded when he shouted “Black Lives Matter” and pumped his fist in the air.

In a tweet Thursday, Trump referred to Wheeler as the “Radical Left Mayor of Portland, who last night was booed & shouted out of existence by the agitators & anarchists.”

Wheeler has opposed federal agents’ presence in Oregon’s largest city. He has faced harsh criticism and his presence wasn’t welcomed by many demonstrators who yelled and swore at him.

“I want to thank the thousands of you who have come out to oppose the Trump administration’s occupation of this city,” Wheeler told hundreds of people gathered downtown. “The reason this is important is it is not just happening in Portland ... we’re on the front line here in Portland.”

Wheeler has been accused by critics including city council members of not reining in local police who used tear gas multiple times on protesters before federal agents arrived early this month in response to nearly two months of nightly protests since George Floyd was killed. And city business leaders have condemned Wheeler for not bringing the situation under control before the agents showed up.

Department of Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf denied that federal agents were inflaming the situation in Portland. He told “CBS This Morning” on Thursday that Wheeler legitimized criminality in the city by going to the front of the crowd of demonstrators where the fires were lit and people were trying to pull down the protective fence.

Wolf said Wheeler had cited violence in the city before federal officers arrived.

Wheeler did not participate in lighting any of the fires or attempting to tear down the fence and was surrounded by his security team when he was gassed.

Earlier, protesters held signs saying “Tear Gas Ted” in reference to the Portland Police Bureau’s use of the substance before federal agents arrived. As Wheeler left the protest zone about 12:40 a.m. Thursday, one person shouted that he should be there “every single night.”

Less than an hour after Wheeler left, the Portland Police Bureau declared there was a riot at the site and threatened to use tear gas but officers never did and made no arrests.

In a statement later Thursday, police said the crowd threw Molotov cocktails, lit fires in a park and in trash cans and released hundreds of gallons of water from fire hydrants.

Before he was tear-gassed, Wheeler was criticized for cutting the local police budget and for not assigning Portland police to protect protesters from federal agents.

Wheeler’s appearance in the protest zone came hours after state attorneys for Oregon urged a judge to issue a restraining order against agents deployed to tamp down on the protests.

The arguments came in a lawsuit filed by Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who accused federal agents of arresting protesters without probable cause, whisking them away in unmarked cars and using excessive force. Federal authorities have disputed those allegations.

The lawsuit is part of the growing criticism of Trump’s order that sent the federal agents to Portland and pending orders for them to head to Chicago and Albuquerque, New Mexico, to fight rising crime.

Trump’s move has deepened the country’s political divide and has potentially set up a constitutional crisis months ahead of the presidential election. Democratic mayors of 15 cities have condemned the use of federal officers in a letter to the U.S. attorney general.

Full Coverage: Racial injustice

The court hearing focused on the actions of the more than 100 federal agents responding to protests outside the Portland courthouse.

The motion asks U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman to command agents from the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Patrol, Federal Protective Service and U.S. Marshals Service to immediately stop detaining protesters without probable cause, identify themselves and their agency before arresting anyone, and explain why an arrest is taking place.

On Thursday, a judge is expected to hear arguments in a legal challenge that the American Civil Liberties Union filed on behalf of journalists — including a freelance photographer for The Associated Press — and legal observers who say they were targeted by Portland police while documenting demonstrations.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of volunteer medics who have been attending to injured protesters.

Wheeler, 57, a sixth-generation Oregonian was born and raised in Portland and attended local public schools.

Millennials own less than 5% of all U.S. wealth,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/millennials-own-less-than-5percent-of-all-us-wealth.html,"Despite making up the largest portion of the workforce, millennials controlled just 4.6% of U.S. wealth through the first half of 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Baby boomers control over 53% of the country's wealth, while Gen X accounts for just over 25% and the silent generation holds around 17%, according to the Fed's data, which breaks down U.S. wealth in the beginning of 2020 by age, class and race.

While it's not abnormal for older generations to be wealthier than younger generations — they have had longer to earn money and accumulate assets, after all — the Fed's data also shows that millennials have far less wealth than boomers did at the same age.

In 1989, when baby boomers were around the same age as millennials are today, they controlled 21% of the nation's wealth. That's almost five times as much as what millennials own today.

Many previous reports have found that millennials are, on average, worse off financially than their parents and grandparents were at the same age, despite being better educated.

And the coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the inequality. While every corner of the economy has been impacted, job losses have been particularly heavy on low-wage workers in industries like retail, education and hospitality. Millennial workers — as well as women and minorities — make up a disproportionate share of these workforces.

Additionally, millennials have largely missed out on the gains made in the stock market over the past few months. They own just 2% of total equity in corporations and mutual fund shares. Baby boomers, meanwhile, own over 55%.

"""Green capitalism will never facilitate the scale of action that is necessary to keep warming below 1.5ºC or even 2ºC""",https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/10/we-cant-stop-climate-change-without-class-war,"As fires rage in California, the permafrost melts in Siberia, heat waves strike Europe, and hurricanes and typhoons grow ever stronger, there is an urgent need for ambitious climate action. The question is what it will look like, and who will bear the burden of a transition to a more sustainable world.

For several decades now, the dominant environmental messaging to the public has been about individual action. We were told that to solve the climate crisis, we needed to change our lightbulbs, switch to energy-efficient appliances, buy hybrid or electric vehicles, better insulate our homes, stop using plastic bags, and alter our personal consumption in other ways.

These things are undoubtedly positive changes, but they are not enough to address the scale of the crisis we face and they can lead to perverse conclusions about where the blame for the climate crisis truly lies.

There is a growing argument that one of the driving forces of the climate crisis is the global population. The world is overpopulated, these people say, and that is why emissions are so high. This view is most commonly expressed by eco-fascists, who believe a genocide is needed to reduce the human population. But overpopulation has also been cited by leading liberal figures such as primatologist Jane Goodall and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, helping to fuel misleading and troubling conclusions about what is fuelling climate change.

While focusing on personal consumption places the responsibility on all of us somewhat equally, focusing on population growth shifts the blame to countries in Africa and Asia where populations have continued growing in recent decades. Yet these people have among the lowest carbon footprints in the world, and when we look at which jurisdictions have emitted the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, the answer is definitive: the United States and Europe.

But even blaming it wholly on Americans and Europeans is missing the bigger picture. A new Oxfam report finds that the richest 1% of people alone are responsible for double the emissions of the poorest 50% of the global population. That means that even if the working class of the Global North took all the individual actions that are recommended or we forced poor people in the Global South stop having kids, that still wouldn’t solve the problem.

Our remaining carbon budget is being sacrificed so the global elite can keep their lavish lifestyles, while they take private jets to climate conferences so they can give the impression they care. Virgin founder Richard Branson has been a leader in this billionaire greenwashing, making climate pledges he didn’t follow through on while expanding his airline business. Similarly, Elon Musk claims to care about the climate to sell more automobiles, while criticising public transit and trying to stop high-speed rail projects.

But maybe the most prominent of these billionaires who greenwash their unsustainable activities is Jeff Bezos. Earlier this year, the Amazon CEO was lauded in the press for his $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund — he even bought the rights to rename a Seattle stadium after his Climate Pledge! But no grants have yet been issued from the fund, while Amazon continues to help oil and gas companies more efficiently extract fossil fuels.

These billionaires assert that capitalism can solve the climate crisis, and their investments are helping to create a new form of “green capitalism” that will reduce emissions and usher in a sustainable future. Governments are also falling for this myth and putting it at the centre of their pandemic recovery plans.

In July, the British government announced a £350 million recovery plan to put the country at the forefront of “green innovation” – a drop in the ocean of the investment needed. Predictably, it included no suggestion of taking on the emissions of the wealthy by reducing their wealth, banning private jets, or winding down the polluting industries from which they profit.

Meanwhile, in the United States, President Donald Trump doesn’t have a climate plan, but even Joe Biden focuses on renewables and electric cars, while promising new highways with charging stations and refusing to ban fracking. To their north, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent throne speech promised to make climate action a “cornerstone” of Canada’s pandemic recovery, while centring on electric vehicles, mining more components for them, and investing more in hydro power. He was silent on the environmental impacts of those initiatives.

Green capitalism will never facilitate the scale of action that is necessary to keep warming below 1.5ºC or even 2ºC because it refuses to take on the powerful people and industries that are fuelling the climate crisis in the first place. It continues to ensure the benefits flow to the top while hollowing out the middle class and producing climate narratives which shift the burden of responsibility onto those who have little power to make the necessary changes: the public, if not the global poor.

The kind of climate action we need requires taking on the wealthy and organising around a vision for a different kind of society. That means not just making the rich pay higher taxes, but actively dismantling the economic structures that facilitate their wealth accumulation, treat the planet as an unlimited bounty of free raw materials, and generate all the emissions warming the planet.

Either we take on capitalism and its victors, or we’ll be unable to stop runaway climate change, help the climate refugees it will create, or stop the eco-fascist myth of overpopulation that will surge as a result. Our choice is socialism or barbarism, as Rosa Luxemburg once said. Green capitalism won’t save us."
71% of People in This Country Believe Civilization Will Collapse,https://247wallst.com/economy/2020/10/12/71-of-people-in-this-country-believe-civilization-will-collapse/,"71% of People in This Country Believe Civilization Will Collapse

The bruising global competition among Russia, China and the United States has added to an environmental crisis that will flood much of the world and help burn more of it. Mass starvation and internal political strife in countries around much of the globe has caused an unexpectedly large number of people to think human civilization will end. A new survey asked people about their beliefs on the subject. In one large country, 71% of those asked say civilization is on its way out.

French think tank the Jean Jaurès Foundation surveyed people in five countries about their views of the future. These countries included France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. The exact question was whether civilization as we know it today will collapse in the years to come. Among Italians, 71% agreed. This was followed by 65% of French respondents, 56% of those from the United Kingdom, 52% of Americans and 39% of Germans. Among the experts who study the trends, it is called “collapsology.”



The view people have of the future prospects of their own nations played an important part in the level of pessimism. As the authors point out:

[I]t should be noted that it is in Germany, a country with a very strong economic and institutional base, that the prognosis for the collapse of civilization is the least widespread, followed by the two Anglo-Saxon countries and finally by France and Italy, nations with less satisfactory economic performance and where social and political tensions are high.



The level of pessimism about the future varies by income, political leanings and age. For example, in the United States, 63% of those under 35 years old questioned believed a collapse was in the future. This dropped to 54% among people ages 35 to 49 who answered yes to the question. This dropped to 45% for those between 50 years old and 64. For those 65 years old or older, the number fell to 41%. Based on age levels, the figures were spread in the same way across the other countries.

People with lower educational attainment and low incomes were more likely to believe society would collapse than those with high incomes and more education.

Those who believe civilization will collapse fall into two discrete segments:

Those who think that the consequences of global warming and overconsumption (disappearance of species, climatic disasters, depletion of resources) will drive a fairly sudden collapse.

Those who think there will be no sudden collapse but rather a gradual deterioration of current living conditions.

About two-thirds of the people in each country subscribed to one or the other outlook. The balance of those questioned had other theories.

Many survivalists think world civilization will collapse, the research shows. These people often believe their future will be built on three factors: “garden, autonomy and self-defense.”

Given the state of unrest, global environmental challenges and poverty in the United States and Europe, that some people think society will collapse is no surprise. What is shocking is that the beliefs come in such large numbers.

"China is rapidly and illegally gobbling up the world’s second largest rainforest, in Africa, to fuel America’s appetite for cheap furniture",https://returntonow.net/2018/10/29/china-is-turning-the-rainforest-into-cheap-furniture-for-the-u-s/,"U.S. consumers have long f, but little have we known the high price the global community has paid for it.

Recent reports of Brazil’s new president’s plans to open up the Amazon rain forest to agriculture and mining have the world worried about the effects of deforestation on global climate change.

The entire planet is dependent on these two major rainforests for sinking carbon dioxide and keeping global warming from spiraling out of control.

In addition to potential climate catastrophe, China’s illegal deforestation of the Congo Basin is robbing local Africans of resources vital to their survival.

And because Chinese loggers want only round logs (raw timber), they’re not even providing any local employment (via sawmilling or woodworking) to those whose land is being raped.

This ensures China maximizes profits while local countries stay poor.

A report by the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency found that state-owned Chinese companies play a major role in the illegal logging industry, a $30 billion dollar industry globally.

“More than half of China’s current supplies of raw timber material are sourced from countries with a high risk of illegal logging and poor forest governance,” the agency said.

Many developed nations – such as the U.S., Australia, and E.U. – are enacting laws to ban illegal timber imports.

For example, in 2013, the European Union introduced the E.U. Timber Regulation. It requires ‘due diligence’ from importers to verify that timber being brought into E.U. markets isn’t illegally harvested.

This slowed timber exports from the Congo Basin to the E.U., but China was quick to exploit the void.

While some environmental groups focus on encouraging China to outlaw illegal logging imports, others say there needs to be more awareness in consumer nations, like the United States, about where their furniture comes from."
"Max Brooks, author of the novel World War Z, saw COVID-19 coming. ""I wasn’t given some secret information. I got my information from the news."" ""The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I’m the smartest guy in the room, we’re in big trouble.""",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/max-brooks-pandemics-science-fiction-world-war-z-devolution,"Max Brooks is getting a little tired of being proved right. An author with cult appeal and massive sales, he is regularly referred to as “a soothsayer” and “a genius”. His 2006 novel, World War Z, was about a deadly virus originating in China that causes global devastation, and his compulsive new one, Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Sasquatch Massacre, is about people forced into self-isolation, huddling in terror from an unimaginable threat outside. But Brooks, 47, is dismissive of the hyperbole: “Everything I write about has already happened. The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I’m the smartest guy in the room, we’re in big trouble,” he tells me over Skype from his home in Los Angeles (our interview was in May, before the national protests after the killing of George Floyd, but well after lockdown started.). He has the jittery energy of the chronically anxious, and the easy confidence of one who has been thoroughly validated.

He certainly saw the coronavirus coming long before most politicians, and was making preparations in January. On 16 March, when most people in the western world were barely getting to grips with the lockdown, he made a video about the importance of social distancing to protect the elderly. He enlisted the help of the oldest person in his life, his father, comedy god, Mel Brooks. “If I get the coronavirus, I’ll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who can give it to Dick Van Dyke, and before I know it, I’ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends,” says Brooks, pointing to his father behind a glass door and listing his closest friends. The video has been watched more than 16m times. “I wasn’t given some secret information. I got my information from the news. Really deep state: turning on CNN and watching Wuhan getting locked down,” he says dryly.

I thought World War Z was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote

Nonetheless, he even scared himself when he predicted a day in his own life. Despite its title, Devolution has nothing to do with Scottish political independence, “and I’ll do a Scottish apology tour if it’s a problem, from the Outer Hebrides to Hadrian’s Wall,” he says. It tells the story of an eco-community that is cut off from the outside world after a volcano erupts, and that is only the start of their problems. The novel is largely told through the journal of Kate, one of the community’s inhabitants, and in one scene she warns her partner, Dan, against cleaning the solar panels on their roof, because she’s worried he’ll hurt himself. “Injury turns you from a giver to a taker,” another inhabitant adds.

Cut to spring 2020 and Brooks is in lockdown at home with his wife, Michelle Kholos (“the greatest playwright in the world!”) and their teenage son, Henry. He heads up to clean out the gutters on the roof. “And my wife said: ‘Oh no you don’t! If you fall, you can’t cook, you can’t clean, you just consume resources,’” he recalls. Does it freak him out to live in his own books? “It doesn’t freak me out, it saddens me. Because I would much rather be wrong,” he says

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Brad Pitt, left, and Daniella Kertesz in the 2013 film adaptation of World War Z.

World War Z, which uses zombies as a metaphor for the Sars virus, with the infected turning into killer creatures, takes a geopolitical perspective of a pandemic, with each country responding to the crisis in characteristic style: Israel makes brutally pragmatic choices to save itself; the US is overconfident about its exceptionalism. The parallels with today are breathtaking.

“But on a personal level, the day-to-day life of what we’re all going through now, that’s played out in Devolution. And that I did not expect,” says Brooks. And that’s no surprise, given Devolution is a thriller about Big Foot. Yet the novel provides very practical solutions for how to deal with isolation and fear – growing your own vegetable garden, seeking out small groups of trusted friends – and it is to Brooks’s credit that his galumphing beasts are genuinely scary, as opposed to laughable. When I make the mistake of mentioning the saccharine 1980s Big Foot family comedy, Harry and the Hendersons, Brooks – who takes his responsibilities to fans of horror (“my tribe”) as seriously as any other part of his research – recoils in disgust: “Noooo!”

Brooks has always been a worrier. When I ask if he was an anxious kid, he reels back as if I’d asked if the Pacific Ocean is wet: “Oh GAHHHHD. Yes!” he gasps. He researches disasters because it’s when he doesn’t understand something, or what to do about it, that he spins out. “Knowledge calms me down. I can deal with fear, it’s the anxiety I have trouble with,” he says. It’s a testament to the thoroughness of his research that after the publication of World War Z he was invited to join the Modern War Institute at West Point as a non-resident fellow. There, he writes articles about “non-military issues that could turn violent in the future,” he says, such as a recent piece about how corporations now control the food chain, and he lectures cadets about how to think creatively.

Max Brooks (@maxbrooksauthor) A message from me and my dad, @Melbrooks. #coronavirus #DontBeASpreader pic.twitter.com/Hqhc4fFXbe

But how to educate the public? He knows some people don’t listen to lectures, or even the news. So instead he channels his knowledge into popular fiction. “I write about fictional threats, because they’re easier for people to deal with, but I provide factual solutions,” he says. World War Z, which has sold over 1m copies, has been named among the best horror books of all time, alongside Stephen King’s It and Bram Stoker’s Dracula. But Brooks’s writing hero is thriller writer Tom Clancy, famously another fan of research. “The best way to educate is to entertain. In the second world war, the US government got Hollywood on board to break down the complicated strategic ideas into very simple stories, and America used to be the best at that. But somewhere along the line we gave up,” he says.

While stressing that he’s “quite proud to be the child of these two awesome parents” – his mother was the late, great Anne Bancroft – Brooks has generally kept his parents at arm’s length from his career. Unlike plenty of other Hollywood progeny, he has not wanted to be known as anyone’s junior, because he found out early on that it would only hurt him: his first book, The Zombie Survival Guide (2003), was originally marketed as “Mel Brooks Jr writes Young Frankenstein part two!” The book flopped, “and no surprise, because the media looked at it and said: ‘This is the least funny book ever’, and the horror people thought Mel Brooks’s brat was taking a giant dump on something they loved,” he says.

Everyone wanted Anne Bancroft to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes

Brooks is not anyone’s image of a Hollywood brat. Yes, his parents had famous friends: Reiner, Van Dyke, Gene Wilder. But when they would all meet up on Sundays, they tended to talk about whether anyone had found a good dentist in Los Angeles, and who knew of a decent car mechanic. “They were all immigrants to this town – they were trying to figure out how to live,” Brooks says. The family was comfortable, but his father drove him to school in a Honda Accord 1982 (“best car ever”) because, he told his son: “It’s OK to make your fortune. But don’t drive your fortune past people who are starving.” His dad may have written the line, “If you got it, flaunt it”, for The Producers, but that was very much not how he lived. “Both my parents came from poverty and most people who are first-generation wealth always worry they’re going to lose their money, because they’re not really sure where it came from,” says Brooks. His father lives close by in Santa Monica and, until the virus started, he would come to Brooks’s house every evening before heading off for his nightly dinner with his best friend, Carl Reiner. These days, Brooks and his son go to his father’s house and wave at him through the glass door, just as he did in the video.

Brooks has his mother’s dark Italian colouring and his father’s features as well as his wit. (When I ask if he liked the 2013 movie adaptation of World War Z, starring Brad Pitt, he replies: “I thought it was a really cool movie that happened to have the same title of a book I once wrote.”) He credits his love of science and research to his mother: “In show business they only ever want one flavour and everyone just wanted her to be sexy Mrs Robinson. Nobody cared that her favourite book was about microbes – but I did. Everything I am comes from her,” he says.

Bancroft was 40 when she was pregnant with Brooks and had long since given up hope of conceiving. She was asked if she wanted a test for Down’s syndrome, but was warned if she had a termination she would never be able to get pregnant again. Bancroft refused, saying she would love this baby whatever. “So I was very ... appreciated,” says Brooks.

America has the most incompetent, disastrous, captain ever, but the ship has had mechanical problems for some time

As a child, he struggled with reading, and although the school dismissed him as another lazy Hollywood kid, his mother suspected he was dyslexic. She was right. There was little help available to dyslexic kids in the early 80s, but in 1959 Bancroft had won an Oscar for her performance in The Miracle Worker as Annie Sullivan, who taught Helen Keller, who was deaf and blind, how to read. So she knew about services available to blind children and she adapted them for her son, such as turning his schoolbooks into audiobooks, so he could read along to the tapes. “People assume because of who my parents are that I had this very privileged childhood. And they’re damn right, because I had this incredible mother who understood her son,” he says. His father, he says, “was busy feeding us. My parents were great partners.” Bancroft died from uterine cancer in 2005, two months after Brooks’s son was born, “so she got to be a grandmother for a bit. Thank God,” he says.

After college, Brooks worked briefly at Saturday Night Live, but soon realised he is really more of a solo worker than a collaborator. At 31, he published The Zombie Survival Guide, turning a lifetime of anxiety about existential threats into something potentially productive. For every one hour of writing, he says, he spends up to 100 hours researching, “and that totally comes from my mom”. People often ask if writing about zombies and Big Foot and apocalypses scares him, because they don’t understand that the writing calms him down. But now he has a different problem: he knows too much.

“I can’t pacify myself with the ignorant notion that we were caught unaware [by the virus]. I can’t go to bed at night thinking, we didn’t have a plan so all the mistakes are forgivable. Here it is!” he says, brandishing a thick wodge of papers, which is the National Response Framework, the United States’s plan for how to respond to emergencies. “So there is absolutely a plan.” According to Brooks, if America had fully locked down the country for three weeks, instead of doing it piecemeal state by state, and maintained a strict lockdown, the virus would have gone.

I ask if the problem was the incumbent president. “I don’t want to blame everything on Trump. America has the most incompetent, disastrous, dangerous captain that we’ve ever had. But the ship has had mechanical problems for some time,” he says. He launches into an engrossing monologue about how trust in the government has collapsed, after it was attacked first by the left in the 1960s, then by the right in the 80s, eroding public trust to a disastrous effect. “We have planted a very bitter crop, and now it’s harvest time,” he says.

But none of this explains why the UK’s response has been so terrible, I say. He throws his hands in the air, exasperated. “I expected all this from us. But I did not expect it from you. I’m shocked, because you already had a national health service, you’re much more unified than us, you still understand the need for government. So what’s your excuse?” he asks. There are some questions even Max Brooks can’t answer.

CDC report gives Covid-19 an R0 of 5.7! Every person infected will infect an average of 5.7 more people. This makes it one of the most infectious diseases on the planet.,https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the current rapidly growing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), originating from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). Initially, 41 cases of “pneumonia of unknown etiology” were reported to the World Health Organization by the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee at the end of December 2019 (2). On January 8, 2020, the pathogen was identified (1), and human-to-human transmission was reported soon after. By January 21, most provinces of China had reported COVID-19 cases. By March 16, the outbreak had led to >170,000 total confirmed cases and >6,500 deaths globally. In a period of 3 months, an outbreak of apparent idiopathic pneumonia had become the COVID-19 pandemic.

Studying dynamics of a newly emerged and rapidly growing infectious disease outbreak, such as COVID-19, is important but challenging because of the limited amount of data available. In addition, unavailability of diagnostic reagents early in the outbreak, changes in surveillance intensity and case definitions, and overwhelmed healthcare systems confound estimates of the growth of the outbreak based on data. Initial estimates of the exponential growth rate of the outbreak were 0.1–0.14/day (a doubling time of 6–7 days), and a basic reproductive number (R 0 ; defined as the average number of secondary cases attributable to infection by an index case after that case is introduced into a susceptible population) ranged from 2.2 to 2.7 (1,3–5). These estimates were based on 2 broad strategies. First, Li et al. used very early case count data in Wuhan before January 4 (1). However, case count data can be confounded by reservoir spillover events, stochasticities in the initial phase of the outbreak, and low surveillance intensity. The epidemic curve based on symptom onset after January 4 showed a very different growth rate (6). Second, inference was performed by using international flight data and infected persons reported outside of China (3–5). Because of the low numbers of persons traveling abroad compared with the total population size in Wuhan, this approach leads to substantial uncertainties (7,8). Inferences based on a low number of observations are prone to measurement error when data are incomplete or model assumptions are not fully justified; both conditions are common challenges associated with rapid and early outbreak analyses of a new pathogen.

We collected an expanded set of case reports across China on the basis of publicly available information, estimated key epidemiologic parameters, and provided a new estimate of the early epidemic growth rate and R 0 in Wuhan. Our approaches are based on integration of high-resolution domestic travel data and early infection data reported in provinces other than Hubei to infer outbreak dynamics in Wuhan. They are designed to be less sensitive to biases and confounding factors in the data and model assumptions. Without directly using case confirmation data in Wuhan, we avoid the potential biases in reporting and case confirmation in Wuhan, whereas because of the high level of domestic travel before the Lunar New Year in China, inference based on these data minimizes uncertainties and risk for potential misspecifications and biases in data and model assumptions.

We collected publicly available reports of 140 confirmed COVID-19 cases (mostly outside Hubei Province). These reports were published by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and provincial health commissions; accession dates were January 15–30, 2020 ( Appendix 1 Table 1). Many of the individual reports were also published on the China CDC official website ( http://www.chinacdc.cn/jkzt/crb/zl/szkb_11803 ) and the English version of the China CDC weekly bulletin ( http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/news/TrackingtheEpidemic.htm ). These reports include demographic information as well as epidemiologic information, including potential periods of infection, and dates of symptom onset, hospitalization, and case confirmation. Most of the health commissions in provinces and special municipalities documented and published detailed information of the first or the first few patients with confirmed COVID-19. As a result, a unique feature of this dataset includes case reports of many of the first or the first few persons who were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in each province, where dates of departure from Wuhan were available.

By using data collected outside Hubei Province, we minimized the effect of changes in surveillance intensity. By the time cases were confirmed in provinces outside Hubei, all of the provinces of China had access to diagnostic kits and were engaging in active surveillance of travelers out of Wuhan (e.g., using temperatures detectors and digital data to identify infected persons [ 9 ]) as the outbreak unfolded. Furthermore, the healthcare systems outside Hubei were not yet overwhelmed with cases and were actively searching for the first positive case, leading to much lower bias in the reporting in each province compared with the time series of confirmed cases in Wuhan.

In the second model, the case count model, we accounted for the detection of additional persons who were infected in Wuhan and received their diagnoses in other provinces and explicitly modeled those persons by using a hybrid deterministic–stochastic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model. We then fitted this model to new daily case count data reported outside Hubei Province during the period before substantial transmission occurred outside of the province.

We developed 2 modeling approaches to infer the growth rate of the outbreak in Wuhan from data from provinces other than Hubei. In the first model, the first arrival model, we computed the likelihood of the arrival times of the first known cases in provinces outside of Hubei as a function of the exponential growing population of infected persons in Wuhan before late January. This calculation involved using domestic travel data to compute the probability that an infected person traveled from Wuhan to a given province as a function of the unknown actual number of infected persons in Wuhan and the probability that they traveled. The timings of the arrivals of the first infected persons in different provinces would reflect the rate of the epidemic growth in Wuhan.

Results

Estimating Distributions of Epidemiologic Parameters We first translated reports from documents or news reports published daily from the China CDC website and official websites of health commissions across provinces and special municipalities in China during January 15–30, 2020. Altogether, we collected 137 individual case reports from China and 3 additional case reports from outside of China (Appendix 1 Table 1). Figure 1 By using this dataset, we estimated the basic parameter distributions of durations from initial exposure to symptom onset to hospitalization to discharge or death. Our estimate of the time from initial exposure to symptom onset (i.e., the incubation period) is 4.2 days (95% CI 3.5–5.1 days) (Figure 1, panel A), based on 24 case reports. This estimated duration is generally consistent with a recent report by Guan et al. (10) showing that the median incubation period is 4 days. Our estimate is ≈1 day shorter than 2 previous estimates (1,11). One potential caveat of our estimation is that because most of the case reports we collected were from the first few persons detected in each province, this estimation might be biased toward patients with more severe symptoms if they are more likely to be detected. The time from symptom onset to hospitalization showed evidence of time dependence (Figure 1, panel B; Appendix 2 Figure 1). Before January 18, the time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 days (95% CI 4.6–6.6 days), whereas after January 18, the duration shortened significantly to 1.5 days (95% CI 1.2–1.9 days) (p<0.001 by Mann–Whitney U test). The change in the distribution coincides with news reports of potential human-to-human transmission and upgrading of emergency response level to Level 1 by the China CDC. The emerging consensus about the risk for COVID-19 probably led to substantial behavior changes among symptomatic persons, in terms of seeking more timely medical care during this period. However, because most of the individual reports were collected in provinces other than Hubei, the change in durations might only reflect changes in the rest of China (rather than in Hubei). We also found that the time from initial hospital admittance to discharge was 11.5 days (95% CI 8.0–17.3 days) (Figure 1, panel C) and from initial hospital admittance to death was 11.2 days (95% CI 8.7–14.9 days) (Figure 1, panel D). The time from symptom onset to death was estimated to be 16.1 days (95% CI 13.1–20.2 days).

Estimating the Growth Rate of the Outbreak in Wuhan in January 2020 Figure 2 Moving from empirical estimates of basic epidemiologic parameters to an understanding of the early growth rates of COVID-19 requires model-based inference and data. We first collected real-time travel data during the epidemic by using the Baidu Migration server, which provides real-time travel patterns in China based on mobile-phone positioning services (Figure 2, panel A; Appendix 1 Methods Table 2,). We estimated that, before the January 23 lockdown of the city, ≈40,000–140,000 people in Wuhan traveled to destinations outside Hubei Province each day (Figure 2, panel B). The extensive travel before the Lunar New Year was probably an important driver of the spread of COVID-19 in China. Figure 3 We then integrated spatiotemporal domestic travel data to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using two mathematical approaches (Appendix 2; conceptual framework depicted in Figure 3, panel A). The first-arrival model uses a unique feature of our case report dataset whereby the dates of departure from Wuhan for many of the first persons who were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in each province were known (Appendix 1 Table 1). We assumed an exponential growth for the total infected population I* in Wuhan, , where I* includes infected persons who are asymptomatic or symptomatic, r is the exponential growth rate, and t 0 is the theoretical time of the exponential growth initiation, so that I*(t 0 ) = 1 in the deterministic model. We call t 0 a “theoretical” time in the sense that it should not be interpreted as the time of first infection in a population. We should expect that t 0 is later than the date of the first infection because multiple spillover events from the animal reservoir might be needed to establish sustained transmission and stochasticity might play a large role in initial dynamics before the onset of exponential growth (12–14). We used travel data for each of the provinces (Appendix 1 Table 3) and the earliest times that an infected person arrived in a province, across a total of 26 provinces (Figure 3, panel B), to infer r and t 0 (Appendix 2). Model predictions of arrival times in the 26 provinces fitted the actual data well (Appendix 2 Figure 2). The growth rate r is estimated to be 0.29/day (95% CI 0.21–0.37/day), corresponding to a doubling time of 2.4 days (95% CI 1.9–3.3 days). t 0 is estimated to be December 20, 2019 (95% CI December 11–26). As we show later, there exist larger uncertainties in the estimation of t 0 . We further estimated that the total infected population size in Wuhan was ≈4,100 (95% CI 2,423–6,178) on January 18 (Appendix 2 Figure 3), which is consistent with a recently posted estimate (7). The estimated number of infected persons was ≈18,700 (95% CI 7,147–38,663) on January 23 (i.e., the date when Wuhan started its lockdown). We projected that without any control measures, the infected population would be ≈233,400 (95% CI 38,757–778,278) by the end of January. Figure 4 An alternative model, the case count approach, used daily new case counts of persons who had COVID-19 diagnosed in other provinces but who had been in Hubei Province within 14 days of becoming symptomatic. This model uses data beyond the first appearance of an infected person from Wuhan but also accounts for the stochastic nature of the process by using a hybrid model. In this model, the infected population in Wuhan was described with a deterministic model, whereas the infected persons who traveled from Wuhan to other provinces were tracked with a stochastic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model (12). We restricted the data to the period of January 19–26, when new cases reported were mostly infections imported from Wuhan (i.e., indicative of the dynamics in Wuhan). The transitions of the infected persons from symptom onset to hospitalization and then to case confirmation were assumed to follow the distributions inferred from the case report data (Appendix 2). Simulation of the model using best-fit parameters showed that the model described the observed case counts over time well (Figure 3, panel C). The estimated theoretical time (t 0 ) is December 16, 2019 (95% CI December 12–21), and the exponential growth rate is 0.30/day (95% CI 0.26–0.34/day). These estimates are consistent with estimates in the first arrival approach (Figure 4; Appendix 2 Figure 4). In both models, we assumed perfect detection (i.e., of infected cases outside of Hubei Province). However, a certain fraction of cases probably was not reported. To investigate the robustness of our estimates, we performed extensive sensitivity analyses to test 23 different scenarios of surveillance intensity (Appendix 2). First, we tested the assumption that a constant fraction of infected persons (e.g., persons with mild or no symptoms) (15) were not detected. We found that under this assumption, t 0 would be earlier than our estimate but the estimation of the growth rate remained the same (Appendix 1 Table 4). Second, we tested the assumption that the intensity of surveillance increases over the period of data collection, although this scenario is less likely because of the intensive surveillance implemented outside Hubei Province. We found that our data in general do not support this hypothesis on the basis of corrected Akaike Information criterion scores (Appendix 1 Table 4). However, if the intensity of surveillance outside Hubei Province increased over the period of January, we would predict a lower growth rate than the estimate we just described. For the worst-case scenario considered, we estimated the growth rate of the outbreak to be 0.21/day (Appendix 2).

Other Evidence of a High Growth Rate of the Outbreak in Wuhan In addition to using 2 modeling approaches, we looked for other evidence of a high outbreak growth rate to cross-validate our estimations. We found that the time series of reported deaths in Hubei, which is less subject to the biases of the confirmed case counts, is simply not consistent with a growth rate of 0.1/day (Appendix 2 Figure 5). As the infected population grows, the number of death cases will grow at the same rate but with a delayed onset corresponding to the time from infection to death. Fitting a simple exponential growth model to the number of reported deaths in Hubei during late January 2020 yields an estimate of 0.22–0.27/day, which is within the 95% CI of the estimation we previously described. Overall, these analyses suggest that although there exist uncertainties depending on the level of surveillance, the exponential growth rate of the outbreak is probably 0.21–0.3/day. This estimation is much higher than previous reports, in which the growth rate was estimated to be 0.1–0.14/day (1,3–5).

Estimating R 0 The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is dependent on the exponential growth rate of an outbreak, as well as additional factors such as the latent period (the time from infection to infectiousness) and the infectious period (16,17), both of which cannot be estimated directly from the data. Following the approach by Wearing and Rohani (16), we found that with a high growth rate of the outbreak, R 0 is in general high and the longer the latent and the infectious periods, the higher the estimated R 0 (Appendix 2 Figure 6). Figure 5 To derive realistic values of R 0 , we used previous estimates of serial intervals for COVID-19. The serial interval is estimated to be ≈7–8 days based on data collected early in the outbreak in Wuhan (1). More recent data collected in Shenzhen Province, China, suggests that the serial interval is dependent on the time to hospital isolation (Q. Bi et al., unpub. data, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423). When infected persons are isolated after 5 days of symptoms (a probable scenario for the early outbreak in Wuhan, where the public was not aware of the virus and few interventions were implemented), the serial interval is estimated to be 8 days (Q. Bi et al., unpub. data). Thus, these results suggest a serial interval of 7–8 days. With this serial interval, we sampled latent and infectious periods within wide biologically plausible ranges (Appendix 2) and estimated the median R 0 to be 5.8 (95% CI 4.4–7.7) (Figure 5, panel A). To include a wider range of serial interval (i.e., 6–9 days) (Figure 5, panel A; Appendix 2 Figure 6), given the uncertainties in these estimations, we estimated that the median of estimated R 0 is 5.7 (95% CI of 3.8–8.9) (Figure 5, panel B). The estimated R 0 can be lower if the serial interval is shorter. However, recent studies reported that persons can be infectious for a long period, such as 1–3 weeks after symptom onset (18; R. Woelfel et al., unpub data. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20030502); thus, we believe that a mean serial interval shorter than 6 days is unlikely during the early outbreak in Wuhan, where infected persons were not rapidly hospitalized."
"Amid unprecedented wildfires in Oregon, ""the state's largest firefighting helicopters are unavaliable; they were deployed to Afghanistan""",https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/479493-387403-oregon-governor-issues-emergency-fire-order-three-prisons-evacuated-pwoff,"Oregon governor issues emergency fire order; three prisons evacuated

The state's largest firefighting helicopters are unavailable; they were deployed to Afghanistan.

A large number of fires breaking out across the state is a ""once in a generation event,"" that will last for at least another two days, Gov. Kate Brown said Tuesday, Sept. 8.

Brown declared a conflagration emergency on Tuesday due to rapidly spreading wildfires. She said thousands of people had been ordered to evacuate in the swiftly changing situation.

""Get the hell out,"" Brown said, quoting a comment about evacuation orders by Sen. Herman Baertschiger Jr., R-Grants Pass.

The Santiam Fire had burned 131,000 acres and is moving west toward the Salem area. The Holiday Farm Fire in Lane County closed Highway 126 between Springfield and Bend. Fire officials said both blazes started on the east side of the Cascades and jumped the ridges to the west.

The scope of the fires was presented late Tuesday in a press conference that included state fire, emergency management and public health officials. About 3,000 firefighters are involved from around the state, with the focus Tuesday on evacuations.

The rapidly expanding map of fires included Clackamas and Washington counties in the Portland area, along with Lincoln, Klamath and Lane counties, according to said Doug Grafe of the Oregon Department of Forestry.

A 2,000 acre-fire near Chiloquin in Klamath County closed U.S. Highway 97. In the late afternoon, two fires were reported in the Medford area.

Officials said they are unaware of any loss of life. Fires have destroyed structures in Mill City in Marion County and other areas.

""We know our losses are going to be great,"" Brown said.

State officials were working on evacuation plans and shelters that will take into account the COVID-19 pandemic.

Winds that topped 50 miles per hour in valleys west of the Cascades on Monday pushed fires rapidly west. The winds topped 30 mph on Tuesday, with occasional gusts of 40 mph. Winds are expected to drop to less than 15 mph on Wednesday.

""Thursday is really our turning point to go on the offensive,"" Grafe said.

Grafe said the fires were stoked by the driest conditions and the largest amount of underbrush and other fuel in three decades.

In addition to winds from the east, winds from the north will take hold on Wednesday, pushing smoke from fires south.

Brown said there are initial reports that some of the fires may have been caused by downed power lines. She promised an investigation into the causes of the fires after the emergency is over.

The Oregon Department of Corrections evacuated 1,450 inmates from three Salem-area facilities due to the fire danger. The inmates from the Oregon State Correctional Institution, Santiam Correctional Institution, and Mill Creek Correctional Facility were moved to the Oregon State Penitentiary. No inmates were released from custody, officials said.

Smoke was reported as far west as U.S. Highway 101 on the Oregon Coast. Much of the Willamette Valley was under a heavy cloak of smoke, with ash falling on homes and cars.

The Oregon National Guard is operating four UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters out of Madras to drop fire retardant. Six of the state's largest firefighting helicopters, the CH-47 Chinooks, are not available because they have been deployed to Afghanistan at the request of the Department of Defense to aid in military missions. The National Guard was activating three 125-soldier firefighting teams to be deployed as needed.

The Oregon National Guard is operating a total of seven helicopters supporting firefighting efforts. Six HH-60M Black Hawks, five outfitted with Bambi buckets to support water drops and one to support search and rescue operations. A UH-72 Lakota with infrared radar is being used to aid in fire mapping.

Fairgrounds in Marion, Polk and Lane counties were opened for evacuated livestock.

High winds caused power outages in the Crater Lake National Park area.

Nationwide, 15 new large fires were reported Monday bringing the national total to 87 large fires that have burned more than 2.7 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. An update on Tuesday's new fires would be posted Wednesday, according to the agency.

Officials said Oregon residents should monitor the mass emergency notification systems of their local law enforcement and fire agencies. Most offer alerts via cell phone."
Portland protesters report severe and lasting side effects from the chemical weapons used during Trump’s “Operation Diligent Valor.”,https://theintercept.com/2020/10/10/portland-tear-gas-chemical-grenades-protests/,"By the time she was standing in front of the federal courthouse on Lownsdale Square on the night of July 25, Olivia Katbi Smith had already been exposed to tear gas several times. On those previous occasions during the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, Oregon, this summer, being gassed had been very unpleasant: leaving her coughing and making her eyes and nose run and sting. But this time, standing about 30 feet from the fence that was surrounding the downtown courthouse, Smith felt suddenly and violently worse than she ever had before. “I didn’t know if I was going to puke or pass out,” she recalled recently. “I was stumbling, trying to get away.” Smith, who is 28, was wearing goggles plus an N95 mask and thought that whatever was making her ill might have been trapped inside her mask. “So I made a really bad instinctual decision to take it off,” she said. “And instead of bringing relief, it instantly felt so much worse, like I was trapped in the air. It was overwhelming. I could not breathe.” Smith, like thousands of others in Portland, took to the streets in June to protest the suffocation and killing of George Floyd by a police officer. By the beginning of July, the crowds had begun to thin somewhat. But after Trump decided to send federal law enforcement to the city that month, the number of protesters surged and violence escalated. And according to interviews with more than a dozen people who attended the protests and research by the Portland-based Chemical Weapons Research Consortium, there was a marked shift in the use of chemical munitions on the crowds in the second half of July, as the federal agents released greater amounts and different types of smoke and gas onto crowds that seemed to set off severe and sometimes lasting health effects. Smoke Grenades The Portland Police Bureau began using tear gas on Black Lives Matters protesters almost as soon as they first assembled in late May. Mayor Ted Wheeler acknowledged that the city has used “CS” tear gas. The commonly used formulation contains 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, a compound that was designed to induce immediate pain but can also have long-term effects, including chronic bronchitis. In early September, Wheeler ordered the police to stop using it. Tear gas is banned in war but can be used to disperse crowds of civilians.

After federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security descended on Portland in July in a mission dubbed “Operation Diligent Valor,” the use of chemical irritants to control, drive away, and confuse protesters and obscure the actions of law enforcement grew and intensified. Among the products that federal agents appear to have used during the military-style crackdown is a hexachloroethane “smoke grenade” manufactured by a company called Defense Technology and sold as “Maximum HC Smoke.” Volunteers for the Chemical Weapons Research Consortium collected 20 canisters from the protest area that are the size and shape of the smoke grenades, at least five of which still had Defense Technology labels on them. The group also analyzed the chemical residue on one of the recovered spent canisters and found it contained chemicals known to be released by the smoke grenades. Juniper Simonis, a scientist and researcher with the Portland-based group, said that they were also able to track the use of the “HC” bombs or grenades through video and photographs because of their distinctive burning patterns. “No other type of munition they used burns like it,” said Simonis, who described the smoke bombs as giving off “visible heat” for one-and-a-half to two minutes. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries from The Intercept about its agents’ use of hexachloroethane “smoke grenades” and other kinds of crowd control weapons on protesters in Portland. Defense Technology referred questions about the use of the grenade to its parent company, the Safariland Group, which did not respond.

The HC smoke bomb, which was developed in the 1930s to disperse people and conceal actions on the battlefield, is particularly dangerous to health and the environment. The Military-Style Maximum Smoke HC grenade from Defense Technology is “very toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects” and is “suspected of causing cancer,” according to the grenade’s safety data sheet. Environmental effects of the smoke bombs include defoliation of trees and a long-term reduction in their growth. The health effects of hexachloroethane include nausea, vomiting, central nervous system depression, and kidney and liver damage, according to the compound’s material safety data sheet. Zinc chloride, a compound released by the grenades in even greater amounts than hexachloroethane, has “long-lasting effects” on aquatic life, according to its manufacturer’s safety data sheet. The toxic compound also causes fever, chest pain, and liver damage and is associated with anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss. Although the grenade’s manufacturer, Defense Technology, markets it as “military style,” the Department of Defense appears to have begun phasing out the smoke bomb years ago because it was incredibly dangerous. A 1994 report of the U.S. Army Biomedical Research and Development Laboratory notes, “Exposure of unprotected soldiers to high concentrations of HC smoke for even a few minutes has resulted in injuries and fatalities.” The Department of Defense did not respond to an inquiry about whether it had discontinued use of HC smoke grenades. But a 2012 report by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, the Department of Defense’s environmental program, indicates that the U.S. military was at the time exploring the adoption of several less toxic “obscurants” because of the serious breathing difficulties, swelling of the lungs, severe liver problems, and death associated with the grenades. The SERDP report notes that those health issues “pose a threat to the health of the war fighters that are exposed to this smoke during training and combat.”

Immediate and Lasting Effects Protesters who were exposed to chemical gas and smoke during the standoffs with federal agents in Portland report a constellation of immediate and enduring effects not usually associated with tear gas, including vomiting, hair loss, inability to eat, and inability to focus or “brain fog.” Some of the symptoms are consistent with those the military and the chemical manufacturers have linked to both hexachloroethane and zinc chloride. Many people were instantly sickened by the chemical cloud. “I vomited and the people around me were vomiting as well,” said a medic who goes by Opal Hexen. “A whole block of people was throwing up into their respirators,” said Hexen, who was also wearing a respirator that covered much of her face. “At that point, I felt like I had to take it off to vomit,” she said. “And when I did, I had a blinding, choking feeling. My whole body started shaking. I couldn’t see, and I couldn’t process anything.” Laura Jedeed, who went to the majority of protests in July, didn’t vomit but wanted to. “There’s a gag reflex,” she said of her immediate reaction to the substance that federal agents sprayed into the air. While she had been exposed to tear gas from the Portland Police Bureau on several occasions, “whatever the feds were putting out there felt a lot worse,” said Jedeed. “It burns like you’re on fire for 24 hours.” The night after being exposed, Jedeed slept clutching frozen cans to cool her hands. “And for about a day after, I’d get a gag reflex when I was swallowing.” Long after that, she struggled to eat and by August had lost 10 pounds. Although Jedeed served in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division and was deployed twice to Afghanistan, she said the ordeal of being exposed to chemicals “felt more like combat than anything I experienced in the military.” Others also reported being uninterested in or repelled by food, and weight loss that persisted for days and sometimes weeks after the initial exposure. Mac Smiff, a music journalist and regular at the protests, began to find it difficult to eat in late July after being repeatedly exposed to tear gas and smoke bombs lobbed by federal agents. By early August, he had dropped from 193 to 181 pounds and recently said that he has yet to regain the weight.

The harms caused by the chemical agents are among the many physical injuries that resulted from the clashes with federal agents and local police in Portland. In a report released Thursday, Physicians for Human Rights documented a “consistent pattern of disproportionate and excessive use of force” by both Portland Police Bureau officers and federal agents during the protests throughout June and July. The report details brutal injuries from rubber bullets, other impact munitions, and tear gas canisters thrown at protesters in the city, which has logged more instances of police brutality during this summer of protest than any other U.S. city. The report also noted that the number of serious injuries from these “kinetic impact projectiles” in Portland increased after federal agents arrived in July. Nationwide, the group has confirmed 115 head injuries during the protests following George Floyd’s death between May 26 and July 27. Nate Cohen was one of the people in Portland whom federal agents shot with a tear gas canister in July. Cohen was working as a medic around 1 a.m on July 26. And although U.N. guidance says governments have to protect medical personnel so that protesters have timely access to emergency medical services, and Cohen was wearing seven visible red crosses at the time, he said he felt clearly targeted at close range by the federal agents. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing Cohen and several volunteer street medics in a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the city of Portland for targeting them at the protests.

“Tear gas canisters are not designed and explicitly not meant to be shot at human beings.”

“Tear gas canisters are not designed and explicitly not meant to be shot at human beings,” said Cohen, who has a chronic heart condition that has worsened since the incident and now has a canister-shaped scar on his chest. While local police also used gas canisters as ballistic weapons, the federal agents used them differently, according to Cohen. “The Portland Police Bureau usually shot them into the air,” he said. “The feds were shooting them at people.” And that’s only one of several ways that chemical crowd control weapons were misused to potentially dangerous effect. While Portland police did consistently use tear gas, the federal agents used far more of it. “The amount of tear gas that they used, especially in late July, was so extreme relative to normal procedures that we have no idea what that level of exposure does to people,” said Cohen. The fact that several of the tear gas canisters recovered after the protests showed that the products had expired long ago raises further questions, according to Cohen. “These were 10 to 15 years past their throw-out dates,” he said. “None of us have any clear idea of what happens to CS gas after it begins to break down.”

"Turns out the widely-praised U.S. unemployment rate of ""only"" 13%, reported on Friday, is actually around 16%. The government counted wrong.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/heres-why-the-real-unemployment-rate-may-be-higher-than-reported.html,"Spencer Platt | Getty Images

The unemployment rate in the U.S. improved last month as millions of people returned to the workforce. But the official 13.3% unemployment rate, while still high relative to any point since the Great Depression in the early 20th century, likely understates the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. The real unemployment rate is likely at least 16%, according to the federal government. That would mean roughly 1 in 6 people can't find work.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which published its monthly jobs report Friday morning, admitted the official unemployment rate may be low relative to reality due to an error in data collection.

Furloughed workers

Around 21 million Americans were unemployed as of mid-May, a reduction of 2.1 million people from a month earlier, according to BLS data.

That number includes workers who were furloughed — meaning those who were temporarily laid off — by their companies in recent weeks. More than 15 million workers — about 73% — of the total unemployed are on temporary layoff and expect to be recalled to work once business rebounds. More from Personal Finance:

What the unemployment rate actually means and why it's so important

The stock market could crater again. Investors shouldn't worry

Beware these common scams that specifically target seniors That share is far higher than at any other time in modern history (with the exception of April, when the share was 78.3%). Yet the BLS may have severely undercounted the number of workers classified as ""unemployed on temporary layoff"" due to an error, the agency said.

The BLS determines how many people are unemployed based on a household survey. Survey interviewers misclassified several furloughed workers as being ""absent from work due to 'other reasons,'"" according to the BLS. That's the same category of workers who'd be on vacation, for example.

16.3% unemployment rate

The overall unemployment rate would have been ""about 3 percentage points higher than reported"" if those individuals had been identified correctly, according to the agency. (The estimate isn't seasonally adjusted.) That would put the official unemployment rate at 16.3%. The true rate could be higher still.

The unemployment rate doesn't include the share of workers who may have dropped out of the workforce, perhaps due to feeling pessimistic about the chances of finding a job in the current economy. More than 6 million workers have dropped out of the labor force since February. In fact, the unemployment rate is a much-higher 21.2% as judged by another metric. This metric, which the BLS calls U-6, includes people ""marginally attached to the labor force."" These are people who aren't currently working or looking for work but are available for work, as well as part-time employees who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for part-time employment. The U-6 metric doesn't include the workers misclassified by the agency. Of course, furloughed workers could be recalled back to work quickly, depending on the speed of the economic rebound as states begin to reopen certain business sectors. The unemployment rate would likely rebound faster in this eventuality than if the layoffs were permanent. The same misclassification phenomenon occurred in April, too — the official 14.7% unemployment rate would have been nearly 20% if furloughed workers had been identified correctly, the BLS said."
"MIT Professor: ""Our mission here is to save humanity from extinction due to climate change....We need dramatic change, not yesterday, but years ago. So every day I fear we will do too little too late, and we as a species may not survive Mother Earth’s clapback.""",https://scitechdaily.com/mits-asegun-henry-on-grand-thermal-challenges-to-save-humanity-from-extinction-due-to-climate-change/,"“Our mission here is to save humanity from extinction due to climate change,” says MIT professor.

More than 90 percent of the world’s energy use today involves heat, whether for producing electricity, heating and cooling buildings and vehicles, manufacturing steel and cement, or other industrial activities. Collectively, these processes emit a staggering amount of greenhouse gases into the environment each year.

Reinventing the way we transport, store, convert, and use thermal energy would go a long way toward avoiding a global rise in temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius — a critical increase that is predicted to tip the planet into a cascade of catastrophic climate scenarios.

But, as three thermal energy experts write in a letter published today in Nature Energy, “Even though this critical need exists, there is a significant disconnect between current research in thermal sciences and what is needed for deep decarbonization.”

In an effort to motivate the scientific community to work on climate-critical thermal issues, the authors have laid out five thermal energy “grand challenges,” or broad areas where significant innovations need to be made in order to stem the rise of global warming. MIT News spoke with Asegun Henry, the lead author and the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, about this grand vision.

Q: Before we get into the specifics of the five challenges you lay out, can you say a little about how this paper came about, and why you see it as a call to action?

A: This paper was born out of this really interesting meeting, where my two co-authors and I were asked to meet with Bill Gates and teach him about thermal energy. We did a several-hour session with him in October of 2018, and when we were leaving, at the airport, we all agreed that the message we shared with Bill needs to be spread much more broadly.

This particular paper is about thermal science and engineering specifically, but it’s an interdisciplinary field with lots of intersections. The way we frame it, this paper is about five grand challenges that if solved, would literally alter the course of humanity. It’s a big claim — but we back it up.

And we really need this to be declared as a mission, similar to the declaration that we were going to put a man on the moon, where you saw this concerted effort among the scientific community to achieve that mission. Our mission here is to save humanity from extinction due to climate change. The mission is clear. And this is a subset of five problems that will get us the majority of the way there, if we can solve them. Time is running out, and we need all hands on deck.

Q: What are the five thermal energy challenges you outline in your paper?

A: The first challenge is developing thermal storage systems for the power grid, electric vehicles, and buildings. Take the power grid: There is an international race going on to develop a grid storage system to store excess electricity from renewables so you can use it at a later time. This would allow renewable energy to penetrate the grid. If we can get to a place of fully decarbonizing the grid, that alone reduces carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production by 25 percent. And the beauty of that is, once you decarbonize the grid you open up decarbonizing the transportation sector with electric vehicles. Then you’re talking about a 40 percent reduction of global carbon emissions.

The second challenge is decarbonizing industrial processes, which contribute 15 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. The big actors here are cement, steel, aluminum, and hydrogen. Some of these industrial processes intrinsically involve the emission of carbon dioxide, because the reaction itself has to release carbon dioxide for it to work, in the current form. The question is, is there another way? Either we think of another way to make cement, or come up with something different. It’s an extremely difficult challenge, but there are good ideas out there, and we need way more people thinking about this.

The third challenge is solving the cooling problem. Air conditioners and refrigerators have chemicals in them that are very harmful to the environment, 2,000 times more harmful than carbon dioxide on a molar basis. If the seal breaks and that refrigerant gets out, that little bit of leakage will cause global warming to shift significantly. When you account for India and other developing nations that are now getting access to electricity infrastructures to run AC systems, the leakage of these refrigerants will become responsible for 15 to 20 percent of global warming by 2050.

The fourth challenge is long-distance transmission of heat. We transmit electricity because it can be transmitted with low loss, and it’s cheap. The question is, can we transmit heat like we transmit electricity? There is an overabundance of waste heat available at power plants, and the problem is, where the power plants are and where people live are two different places, and we don’t have a connector to deliver heat from these power plants, which is literally wasted. You could satisfy the entire residential heating load of the world with a fraction of that waste heat. What we don’t have is the wire to connect them. And the question is, can someone create one?

The last challenge is variable conductance building envelopes. There are some demonstrations that show it is physically possible to create a thermal material, or a device that will change its conductance, so that when it’s hot, it can block heat from getting through a wall, but when you want it to, you could change its conductance to let the heat in or out. We’re far away from having a functioning system, but the foundation is there.

Q: You say that these five challenges represent a new mission for the scientific community, similar to the mission to land a human on the moon, which came with a clear deadline. What sort of timetable are we talking about here, in terms of needing to solve these five thermal problems to mitigate climate change?

A: In short, we have about 20 to 30 years of business as usual, before we end up on an inescapable path to an average global temperature rise of over 2 degrees Celsius. This may seem like a long time, but it’s not when you consider that it took natural gas 70 years to become 20 percent of our energy mix. So imagine that now we have to not just switch fuels, but do a complete overhaul of the entire energy infrastructure in less than one third the time. We need dramatic change, not yesterday, but years ago. So every day I fear we will do too little too late, and we as a species may not survive Mother Earth’s clapback.

"CIA veterans who monitored crackdowns abroad see troubling parallels in Trump handling of protests - ""This is what autocrats do. This is what happens in countries before a collapse. It really does unnerve me.""",https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/CIA-veterans-who-monitored-crackdowns-abroad-see-15312234.php,"CIA veterans who monitored crackdowns abroad see troubling parallels in Trump handling of protests

WASHINGTON - The scenes have been disturbingly familiar to CIA analysts accustomed to monitoring scenes of societal unraveling abroad - the massing of protesters, the ensuing crackdowns and the awkwardly staged displays of strength by a leader determined to project authority.

In interviews and posts on social media in recent days, current and former U.S. intelligence officials have expressed dismay at the similarity between events at home and the signs of decline or democratic regression they were trained to detect in other countries.

""I've seen this kind of violence,"" said Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst responsible for tracking developments in China and Southeast Asia. ""This is what autocrats do. This is what happens in countries before a collapse. It really does unnerve me.""

Helt, now a professor at King University in Tennessee, said the images of unrest in U.S. cities, combined with President Donald Trump's incendiary statements, echo clashes she covered over a dozen years at the CIA tracking developments in China, Malaysia and elsewhere.

Other former CIA analysts and national security officials rendered similarly troubled verdicts.

Marc Polymeropoulos, who formerly ran CIA operations in Europe and Asia, was among several former agency officials who recoiled at images of Trump hoisting a Bible in front of St. John's Episcopal Church after authorities fired rubber bullets and tear gas to clear the president's path of protesters.

""It reminded me of what I reported on for years in the third world,"" Polymeropoulos said on Twitter. Referring to the despotic leaders of Iraq, Syria and Libya, he said: ""Saddam. Bashar. Qaddafi. They all did this.""

The impression Trump created was only reinforced by others in the administration. Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged governors to ""dominate the battlespace"" surrounding protesters as if describing U.S. cities as a foreign war zone. Later, as military helicopters hovered menacingly over protesters, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured the streets of the nation's capital in his battle fatigue uniform.

""As a former CIA officer, I know this playbook,"" Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said in a tweet. Before her election to Congress last year, she worked at the agency on issues including terrorism and nuclear proliferation.

One U.S. intelligence official even ventured into downtown Washington on Monday evening, as if taking measure of the street-level mood in a foreign country.

""Things escalated quickly,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of his job. He emphasized that he went as a concerned citizen, not in any official capacity. After seeing tear gas canisters underfoot, he said he ""knew it was time to go"" and departed.

Former intelligence officials said the unrest and the administration's militaristic response are among many measures of decay they would flag if writing assessments about the United States for another country's intelligence service.

They cited the country's struggle to contain the coronavirus, the president's attempt to pressure Ukraine for political favors, his attacks on the news media and the increasingly polarized political climate as other signs of dysfunction.

Trump supporters have defended his handling of the unrest, and his trip across Lafayette Square as a display of the strength needed to restore order in dozens of cities where protests have led to looting, fires and violence.

Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican, said it was ""hard to imagine"" any other president ""having the guts to walk out of the White House like this.""

But there were also indications that senior members of the administration were uncomfortable with the president's outing and eager to minimize their role in it.

A senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that neither Esper nor Milley knew when they set out to accompany Trump that police were about to charge through seemingly docile protesters or that they would find themselves playing supporting roles in a photo op.

Even away from the cameras, Trump has assiduously cultivated the aura of a strongman. Earlier Monday, he had chided governors as ""weak"" for failing to employ adequate force in the face of mounting protests.

""If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time,"" Trump said. He offered no words on how to ease tensions in crowds that have massed largely in anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who was killed while being pinned to the ground, a knee against his neck, by police in Minneapolis.

Brett McGurk, a former top U.S. envoy to the Middle East who spent two years in the Trump administration, said the president's words - recorded by participants and shared with news organizations - would only embolden the world's autocrats and undermine U.S. authority.

""The imagery of a head of state in a call with other governing officials saying 'dominate the streets, dominate the battlespace' - these are iconic images that will define America for some time,"" said McGurk, who led U.S. diplomatic efforts to counter the Islamic State terrorist group. ""It makes it much more difficult for us to distinguish ourselves from other countries we are trying to contest"" or influence, he said.

In recent years, U.S. officials have urged restraint or denounced crackdowns against protesters or vulnerable groups in Russia, Iran, Turkey, Malaysia, Syria and other countries.

Even this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lectured China about its efforts to prevent citizens of Hong Kong from holding a vigil to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests.

""If there is any doubt about Beijing's intent, it is to deny Hong Kongers a voice and a choice,"" Pompeo said in a statement that was met with derision on Twitter because it coincided with Trump-urged crackdowns in the United States.

The seeming hypocrisy in the U.S. position has not been lost on foreign targets of American pressure or criticism.

Ramzan Kadyrov, a Chechen leader previously sanctioned by the United States for alleged human rights abuses, said Tuesday that he was ""watching with horror the situation in the United States, where the authorities are maliciously violating ordinary citizens' rights,"" according to reports from Moscow.

Video emerged on Friday of Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who has since tested positive for the virus, enthusiastically hugging other attendees. He is also seen holding his mask in his hand.

Almost no one is seen wearing a mask at the Rose Garden announcement that Judge Amy Coney Barrett is nominated to the court.

Judge Barrett’s colleague, the president of Notre Dame Reverend John Jenkins has also tested positive. In an email to students, faculty, and staff, he wrote: “I regret my error of judgment in not wearing a mask during the ceremony and by shaking hands with a number of people in the Rose Garden.”

A Trump administration press staffer and a journalist have also tested positive, but are unidentified at present.

Health secretary Alex Azar was seen putting one on at one point during the speech, CNN reports. Attorney General William Barr and Dr Scott Atlas, the latest addition to the White House coronavirus taskforce, were also seen without masks and shaking hands with people.

The news that the president’s close adviser Hope Hicks had Covid-19 broke on Thursday evening, and overnight it was confirmed that both Trump and first lady Melania Trump were also positive.

Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel tested positive earlier in the week and has been isolating at home since Saturday and so is not believed to have been at the Rose Garden event.

Judge Barrett and her husband both had Covid-19 over the summer but made full recoveries.

Covid-19 symptoms can take between two and 14 days to develop, the average being five days. Factoring in the schedules of the president, first lady, Ms Hicks, and Senator Lee over the past week creates a web of many dozens or even hundreds of people with whom they may have come into direct contact.

This potentially includes all of the attendees at the first presidential debate in Ohio; those that joined or met the president on trips to New Jersey and Minnesota; White House and Capitol Hill reporters; GOP senators, and the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Vice president Mike Pence and second Karen Pence have tested negative, as have former vice president Joe Biden and his wife Jill, and Senator Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff."

Saudi Arabia king quarantined as 150 members of the Royal family test positive for coronavirus,https://www.mazechmedia.com/2020/04/saudi-arabia-king-quarantined-as-150-members-of-the-royal-family-test-positive-for-coronavirus/,"Share to friends

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have both gone into isolation after 150 members of the royal family including Saudi Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud tested positive for Coronavirus, according to new reports.

Saudi Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the governor of the capital Riyadh who is in his 70s – is in intensive care after contracting the virus, according to The New York Times, which cited hospital communications, doctors in the country and sources familiar with the family.

Salman, 84, secluded himself on an island palace near Jeddah, while the crown prince quarantined to a remote site on the Red Sea coast.

Doctors at the elite King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh that treats members of the royal family are preparing 500 more beds for an expected influx of patients.

The operators of the facility said:

“Directives are to be ready for VIPs from around the country,” the operators of the elite facility, the King Faisal Specialist Hospital, wrote in a “high alert” sent out electronically on Tuesday to senior doctors and later obtained by the Times.

“We don’t know how many cases we will get but high alert,” said the message, which instructed “all chronic patients to be moved out ASAP” and only “top urgent cases” will be accepted, according to the newspaper.

Saudi princes travel regularly to Europe and some are believed to have contracted the virus abroad and brought it back to Saudi Arabia, the report said.

Saudi Arabia is expecting up to 200,000 coronavirus cases within weeks, the country’s health minister said on Tuesday.

‘Within the next few weeks, studies predict the number of infections will range from a minimum of 10,000 to a maximum of 200,000,’ said minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah, according to state media.

Rabiah, who warned the kingdom faces a ‘critical moment’ in the fight against the virus, said the projection was based on four studies by Saudi and international experts.

Some Saudi cities including the capital Riyadh are under a 24-hour curfew imposed by the interior minister."

The study of 261 senior professionals in the United States found that 21 per cent had clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits. The rate of psychopathy in the general population is about one in a hundred.

Nathan Brooks, a forensic psychologist who conducted the study, said the findings suggested that businesses should improve their recruitment screening.

He said recruiters tend to focus on skills rather than personality features and this has led to firms hiring “successful psychopaths” who may engage in unethical and illegal practices or have a toxic impact on colleagues.

“Typically psychopaths create a lot of chaos and generally tend to play people off against each other,” he said."
Scientists Predict There's 90% Chance Civilization Will Collapse Within 'Decades',https://www.ibtimes.sg/scientists-predict-theres-90-chance-civilization-end-will-collapse-within-decades-49295,"It is just a matter of few decades when the world will witness the ""irreversible collapse"" of the human civilization, unless mankind drastically changes the course, said researchers from the Alan Turing Institute and the University of Tarapacá.

The physicists, Mauro Bologna and Gerardo Aquino have predicted that deforestation will claim the last forests on Earth between 100 and 200 years but the end of civilization would come sooner. As per their prediction, civilization has only a 10 percent chance to survive, which they described as the most ""optimistic scenario.""

The End of Civilization

The team of researchers believes that the end of civilization will come within decades. In the new study, which was published in Nature, the researchers wrote, ""Clearly it is unrealistic to imagine that the human society would start to be affected by the deforestation only when the last tree would be cut down.""

Before humans started to dominate the world, the planet was covered by 60 million square kilometers of the forest but now there are less than 40 million square kilometers of forest, revealed the study.

As trees and forests play a huge role to balance Earth's ecosystem, fewer forests will cause more deduction of oxygen from the blue planet and create an unwanted change in the food chain. ""It is highly unlikely to imagine the survival of many species, including ours, on Earth without [forests],"" the study added.

Based on the scientific model, the researchers came to the conclusion that due to resource consumption, a catastrophic collapse in the human population is the most likely scenario of the dynamical evolution based on current parameters.

The calculations have shown that maintaining the actual rate of population growth and resource consumption, particularly forest consumption, the humans have only a few decades left before the collapse of the civilization

The research finding added that ""A rapid disastrous collapse in population occurs before eventually reaching a low population steady-state or total extinction. We call this point in time the 'no-return point' because if the deforestation rate is not changed before this time the human population will not be able to sustain itself and a disastrous collapse or even extinction will occur.""

Deforestation Is Leading Towards the End

As most deforestation is happening in the tropical regions, a report by scientists from the University of Maryland revealed that the tropics lost about 61,000 square miles of forest in 2017-- an area equivalent to the size of Bangladesh.

The World Bank estimated that since the beginning of the 20th century, around 3.9 million square miles of forest have been lost. As per a 2018 report by The Guardian, every second, a chunk of forest same as the size of a soccer field is lost.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) have claimed that there are four commodities-- responsible for tropical deforestation-- these are beef, soy, palm oil, and wood products. They have estimated that an area almost the size of Switzerland—around 14,800 square miles-- gets lost due to deforestation every year.

Experts believe that developing alternatives to deforestation can help decrease the need for tree clearing which will save the human civilization from extinction. For example, instead of expanding agricultural land by cutting trees, if people adopt sustainable farming practices or new farming technologies and crops, the need for more land would be diminished.

(Bloomberg) -- Jeff Bezos added $13 billion to his net worth on Monday, the largest single-day jump for an individual since the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was created in 2012.

Amazon.com Inc. shares surged 7.9%, the most since December 2018 on rising optimism about web shopping trends, and are now up 73% this year.

Bezos, Amazon’s 56-year-old founder and the world’s richest person, has seen his fortune swell $74 billion in 2020 to $189.3 billion, despite the U.S. entering its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. He’s now personally worth more than the market valuation of giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Nike Inc. and McDonald’s Corp.

Mackenzie Bezos, his ex-wife, gained $4.6 billion Monday and is now the 13th-richest person in the world.

Other tech titans are also enjoying a surge driven partly by people forced to stay at home and helped by the boost given to markets by unprecedented stimulus efforts by governments and central bankers.

Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has added almost $15 billion to his net worth so far this year, even as the company deals with brands boycotting ads on the social network.

USDA let millions of pounds of food rot while food-bank demand soared - State officials and growers say Trump’s Agriculture Department has been woefully slow to respond to farm crisis caused by coronavirus.,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/26/food-banks-coronavirus-agriculture-usda-207215,"Tom Vilsack, who served as agriculture secretary during the Obama administration, put it this way: “It’s not a lack of food, it’s that the food is in one place and the demand is somewhere else and they haven’t been able to connect the dots. You’ve got to galvanize people.”

It has been six weeks since President Donald Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first urged Americans to avoid restaurants as part of national social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of Covid-19 — a move that immediately severed demand for millions of pounds of food earmarked for professional kitchens across the country.

Just 50 miles from Trump’s home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida growers, much of whose produce was destined for restaurant chains, faced an immediate crisis: Find customers for surplus crops or plow the fields under to avoid attracting pests.

Images of farmers destroying tomatoes, piling up squash, burying onions and dumping milk shocked many Americans who remain fearful of supply shortages. At the same time, people who recently lost their jobs lined up for miles outside some food banks, raising questions about why there has been no coordinated response at the federal level to get the surplus of perishable food to more people in need, even as commodity groups, state leaders and lawmakers repeatedly urged the Agriculture Department to step in.

Demand at food banks has increased an average of 70 percent, according to Feeding America, which represents about 200 major food banks across the country. The group estimates that 40 percent of those being served are new to the system.

In mid-April, USDA unveiled a long-awaited $19 billion aid program with $3 billion set aside to buy excess food, a pot of money that would cover a major ramp-up of fresh produce purchases, along with dairy and meats. But federal officials predicted it would take the better part of a month before that food is packed and shipped to food banks and other nonprofits in need. At that point, it will be too late for many produce growers who saw a huge drop in demand right at the peak of their season.

“By the time that comes through, it won’t help Florida,” said Brittany Lee, a blueberry farmer and executive director of the Florida Blueberry Growers Association. Blueberry prices are about half of what they were this time last year, she said.

The Agriculture Department said it has moved expeditiously to respond to the crisis.

“USDA is committed to maximizing our services and flexibilities to ensure children and others who need food can get it during this coronavirus epidemic,” Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement to POLITICO. “This is a challenging time for many Americans, but it is reassuring to see President Trump and our fellow Americans stepping up to the challenges facing us to make sure kids and those facing hunger are fed.”

Department officials declined requests to discuss the government’s approach to capturing the perishable food glut. A spokesperson noted that the department distributes about $2 billion in agricultural products every year to schools, food banks, tribal organizations and others. That number doubled to $4 billion last year as USDA bought up more commodities to help compensate farmers harmed by the trade war.

Nonetheless, the coronavirus catastrophe has laid bare just how tied up in red tape the USDA’s commodity buying system can be. The process typically takes months from start to finish. And the department has historically focused on buying foods that can be stored for long periods — like canned fruit and meats and cheeses — and so is not accustomed to handling an influx of fresh food.

Sudden plunge in demand

In March, about a week after much of the country shut down restaurants, events and other food-service businesses, several produce groups wrote to USDA with an urgent plea to buy perishable commodities because at least $1 billion was “sitting stagnant in the supply chain.”

“There is no reason these high-quality, nutritious, farmer-grown products should be left in facilities to rot when there are so many American families who are suddenly faced with food insecurity,” the groups wrote to Perdue. “These growers and companies are already donating to food banks and others in need and will continue ... but they are also facing their own economic crises.”

The department did not make any fresh purchases in response to that request, according to USDA records. Perdue has yet to respond to the letter.

Shutting down restaurants, cruise ships, hotels and schools may have been crucial for stopping the spread of the virus, but it quickly became a train wreck for the food system. The food-service sector represents about half of the food dollars spent and a quarter of food consumed in the country. Some 40 percent of the country’s fresh produce goes into food service, as consumers increasingly prefer to eat vegetables if someone else is preparing them."
D.C. Mayor Demands Trump’s Military and Unidentified Riot Officers Get the Hell Off Her Streets,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889gkb/dc-mayor-demands-trumps-military-and-unidentified-riot-officers-get-the-hell-off-her-streets,"Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.

WASHINGTON — D.C.’s mayor wants President Trump’s mystery troops off her streets.

In a fiery letter to Trump, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser demanded he withdraw any military presence and “extraordinary law enforcement” from the city. That includes the well-equipped riot officers who aren’t wearing insignias and have refused to identify themselves.

At least some of them are Bureau of Prisons officers, dispatched by Attorney General William Barr, who are specially trained in putting down inmate riots.

The federal officers’ presence is just making the already tense situation worse, according to Bowser, who slammed the “war-like tactic” of using low-flying helicopters to buzz protesters in an attempt to make them scatter.

“The deployment of federal law enforcement personnel and equipment are inflaming demonstrators,” Bowser wrote. “This multiplicity of forces can breed dangerous confusion, such as when helicopters are used in a war-like tactic to frighten and disperse peaceful protesters.”

Bowser ended the city’s state of emergency on Friday after violence appeared to recede following several days of unrest that accompanied protests against police brutality.

But it’s not clear Trump will listen to her demands. D.C.’s unique federal status limits Bowser’s ability to control what happens in her city. And it’s allowed the Trump administration to deploy federal agents patrol territory near the White House with extraordinary independence.

President Trump has openly mulled deploying the U.S. military against demonstrators around the country. But D.C. is a special case where he’s already been able to operate much more freely.

Control of the National Guard in D.C. illustrates the difference between the nation’s capital and regular states.

In Washington D.C., the president is the commander in chief of the area’s National Guard. In a normal state, the governor is in charge, until the president moves to federalize control.

That’s why Trump berated governors as “jerks” and “fools” for not deploying the National Guard in their states to quell unrest — but could turn them loose in D.C. himself without bothering to hurl insults at anyone first.

Barr has coordinated the use of federal officers around the White House, and his own statements have made it sound like a sprawling federal effort involving a host of different agencies.

On June 2, Barr thanked “the many federal law enforcement agencies and personnel who helped protect the District, including the FBI, Secret Service, Park Police, ATF, DEA, Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Marshals Service, Capitol Police, Department of Homeland Security’s CBP and Border Patrol units, and others.”

Some Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at the lack of visible identification. Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia called it “unacceptable.”

BOP director Michael Carvajal denied Thursday that they were deliberately trying to go incognito.

“I’m not aware of any specific Bureau of Prisons personnel being told not to identify themselves,” Carvajal told a press conference Thursday. “What I attribute that to is probably the fact that we normally operate within the confines of our institution, and we don’t need to identify ourselves.”

Some of the Bureau of Prison officers are also part of teams trained at stopping inmate riots known as Special Operations and Response Teams, the administration said Thursday.

There’s history there: In 1992, the BOP deployed 20 SORT teams to Los Angeles during the unrest caused by Rodney King’s violent beating by LAPD officers. Barr was the attorney general in 1992, too.

This time around, Bowser said the officers and the confusion they bring is making tensions worse — and she wants them gone.

“When citizens are unable to clearly identify legitimate law enforcement officers, it creates unnecessary risks for both protestors and officers,” she wrote. “In fact, we found many years ago that conflict between police and citizens is reduced when law enforcement affiliation is apparent.”"
"The Guardian: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the catastrophic fallout of decades of global privatisation and market competition. Global markets have failed to provide people with basic needs like housing and water, say UN special rapporteurs.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/19/covid-19-exposed-catastrophic-impact-privatising-vital-services,"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the catastrophic fallout of decades of global privatisation and market competition.

When the pandemic hit, we saw hospitals being overwhelmed, caregivers forced to work with virtually no protective equipment, nursing homes turned into morgues, long queues to access tests, and schools struggling to connect with children confined to their homes.

People were being urged to stay at home when many had no decent roof over their heads, no access to water and sanitation, and no social protection.

For many years, vital public goods and services have been steadily outsourced to private companies. This has often resulted in inefficiency, corruption, dwindling quality, increasing costs and subsequent household debt, further marginalising poorer people and undermining the social value of basic needs like housing and water. We need a radical change in direction.

There was a glimmer of hope when people seemed to recognise the crucial centrality of public services to the functioning of society. As French president Emmanuel Macron put it on 12 March, the pandemic had revealed that there are goods and services that must be placed outside the laws of the market.

Take water, a commodity all the more vital as washing your hands is one of the best ways to protect yourself from the virus. About 4 billion people worldwide experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. In the Chilean Petorca province, for example, one avocado tree uses more water than the daily quota allocated to each resident. Despite increasing daily water allocation to residents, the ministry of health revoked this decision just eight days later – an indication of how authorities continue to put the interests of private companies above the rights of their people.

And what about the long-awaited vaccine? Recognising that we cannot rely on market forces, more than 140 world leaders and experts have called on governments and international institutions to guarantee that Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines are made available to all, without charge. But the reality is that pharmaceutical companies around the world are competing to sell the first vaccine.

By contracting out public goods and services, governments are paying lip service to human rights

The global mantra to practise physical distancing to avoid spreading the coronavirus is meaningless for the 1.6 billion people living in grossly inadequate housing, let alone the 2% of the world’s population who are homeless. Yet most governments seem unwilling to step back into the housing arena to regulate the financial organisations that have helped create these conditions. The financialisation of housing by these actors has for years resulted in higher rents, evicting low-income tenants, failing to properly maintain housing in good repair and hoarding empty units in order to increase their profits.

By continuing to opt for contracting out public goods and services, governments are paying lip service to their human rights obligations. Rights holders are transformed into the clients of private companies dedicated to profit maximisation and accountable not to the public but to shareholders.

This affects the core of our democracies, contributes to exploding inequalities and generates unsustainable social segregation.

We are six UN independent experts from many different backgrounds, current and former special rapporteurs on a range of economic, social and cultural rights. It is in this capacity that, together, we want to share this message: if human rights are to be taken seriously, the old construct of states taking a back seat to private companies must be abandoned.

New alternatives are necessary. It is time to say it loud and clear: the commodification of health, education, housing, water, sanitation and other rights-related resources and services prices out the poor and may result in violations of human rights.

States can no longer cede control as they have done. They are not absolved of their human rights obligations by delegating core goods and services to private companies and the market on terms that they know will effectively undermine the rights and livelihoods of many people. It is equally crucial that multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, stop imposing financialised models and the privatisation of public services on countries.

This is also a pivotal moment for the human rights community. We call on all those committed to human rights to address the consequences of privatisation head on. Human rights can help articulate the public goods and services we want – participatory, transparent, sustainable, accountable, non-discriminatory and serving the common good.

We are in a state of emergency. This is probably the first of a series of larger crises awaiting us, driven by the growing climate emergency. The Covid-19 crisis is expected to push another 176 million people into poverty. Each of them may see their human rights violated unless there is a drastic change of model and investment in quality public services."
"Police are leaving their post all over Atlanta, calling in sick to protest colleagues' murder charges",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/17/us/rayshard-brooks-atlanta-police-not-answering-calls/index.html,"Atlanta (CNN) The morning after an unusual number of police officers called out sick, only two sergeants and one officer showed up in one of Atlanta's six police zones, according to police officers who don't want to be named.

The shortages come in the wake of the Fulton County district attorney bringing charges against two officers who were involved in the deadly shooting of Rayshard Brooks.

On Wednesday, multiple sources within the Atlanta Police Department told CNN that officers were not responding to calls in three of the department's six zones.

Though the department denied that was the case, a police union director backed CNN's sources' accounts and said that, in some instances, officers were refusing to leave their precincts unless a fellow police officer required backup.

The police department said an unusual number of officers working the late shift had called out sick. The mayor said the city would be OK.

""There's a lot happening in our cities, and our police officers are receiving the brunt of it, quite frankly,"" Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said.

The city has shown its commitment to the officers through a pay raise, and ""we expect that our officers will keep their commitment to our communities,"" she said.

However, she thinks morale is down tenfold, she said.

""We do have enough officers to cover us through the night,"" she said. ""Our streets won't be any less safe because of the number of officers who called out, but it is just my hope again that our officers will remember the commitment that they made when they held up their hand and they were sworn in as police officers.""

The mayor didn't say how many officers had called out.

In its statement, the Atlanta Police Department said reports that multiple officers from each zone had walked off the job were inaccurate.

Earlier suggestions that multiple officers from each zone had walked off the job were inaccurate. The department is experiencing a higher than usual number of call outs with the incoming shift. We have enough resources to maintain operations & remain able to respond to incidents. — Atlanta Police Department (@Atlanta_Police) June 18, 2020

""The department is experiencing a higher than usual number of call outs with the incoming shift. We have enough resources to maintain operations & remain able to respond to incidents,"" the statement said.

Some officers were staying past their shift to make up the difference, Bottoms said, and the city can call on partners in other departments across the metropolitan area if needed.

'They're just fed up'

Vince Champion, the southeast regional director of the International Brother of Police Officers, presented a different account: He received calls throughout the night saying officers were calling out and walking off their shifts.

""Some were just refusing to leave the precincts unless an officer needed help, so it was different things,"" Champion said.

While he didn't have hard numbers, he has heard officers are planning to call out on Thursday, he said.

""They're just fed up. I mean, their mayor has come out and said everything that they used to do with use of force is not valid -- 'Don't do it' -- so I don't know how we defend ourselves when people want to fight us,"" he said.

The callouts are not organized, he said, and he wouldn't consider them a strike. The union had no knowledge of the officers' actions beforehand, he said.

The staffing at Zone 6 was so sparse that when the department heard that several protesters were planning to take over the precinct, the remaining staff removed critical equipment from the building and relocated to another zone, according to Atlanta police officers who didn't want to be named.

There was severe staffing shortages in Zone 1 overnight, the officers said.

Atlanta police officers each patrol one of six zones covering some 500,000 residents who live in the city limits. They also cover Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced Wednesday 11 charges against Garrett Rolfe, who was fired after he shot Rayshard Brooks twice in the back Friday night. A third shot hit a car with three people inside.

The 11 charges Rolfe faces are felony murder, five counts of aggravated assault, four counts of violating his oath of office and one count of criminal damage to property.

Devin Brosnan, the other officer at the shooting, faces an aggravated assault charge for allegedly standing on Brooks in the parking lot. He also faces two counts of violating his oath of office.

Rolfe was a member of a special traffic enforcement unit, which Brosnan requested come to the scene when he suspected Brooks might be intoxicated.

Attorneys for both officers have said they are not guilty.

Bonus for police

The Atlanta Police Foundation is giving every police officer a $500 bonus as a way of saying thanks. Officers are expected to receive the money on Friday.

When asked about the bonus, one Atlanta police officer told CNN, ""I'll believe it when I see it.""

""This is the first time anything like this has been done and the foundation are good people as well, but it's for APD only and it's definitely about morale,"" the officer said."
'My patient caught Covid-19 twice. So long to herd immunity hopes.' Emerging cases of Covid-19 reinfection suggest herd immunity is wishful thinking.,https://www.vox.com/2020/7/12/21321653/getting-covid-19-twice-reinfection-antibody-herd-immunity,"“Wait. I can catch Covid twice?” my 50-year-old patient asked in disbelief. It was the beginning of July, and he had just tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, for a second time — three months after a previous infection.

While there’s still much we don’t understand about immunity to this new illness, a small but growing number of cases like his suggest the answer is yes.

Covid-19 may also be much worse the second time around. During his first infection, my patient experienced a mild cough and sore throat. His second infection, in contrast, was marked by a high fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, resulting in multiple trips to the hospital.

Recent reports and conversations with physician colleagues suggest my patient is not alone. Two patients in New Jersey, for instance, appear to have contracted Covid-19 a second time almost two months after fully recovering from their first infection. Daniel Griffin, a physician and researcher at Columbia University in New York, recently described a case of presumed reinfection on the This Week in Virology podcast.

It is possible, but unlikely, that my patient had a single infection that lasted three months. Some Covid-19 patients (now dubbed “long haulers”) do appear to suffer persistent infections and symptoms.

My patient, however, cleared his infection — he had two negative PCR tests after his first infection — and felt healthy for nearly six weeks.

I believe it is far more likely that my patient fully recovered from his first infection, then caught Covid-19 a second time after being exposed to a young adult family member with the virus. He was unable to get an antibody test after his first infection, so we do not know whether his immune system mounted an effective antibody response or not.

Regardless, the limited research so far on recovered Covid-19 patients shows that not all patients develop antibodies after infection. Some patients, and particularly those who never develop symptoms, mount an antibody response immediately after infection only to have it wane quickly afterward — an issue of increasing scientific concern.

What’s more, repeat infections in a short period are a feature of many viruses, including other coronaviruses. So if some Covid-19 patients are getting reinfected after a second exposure, it would not be particularly unusual.

In general, the unknowns of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 currently outweigh the knowns. We do not know how much immunity to expect once someone is infected with the virus, we do not know how long that immunity may last, and we do not know how many antibodies are needed to mount an effective response. And although there is some hope regarding cellular immunity (including T-cell responses) in the absence of a durable antibody response, the early evidence of reinfections puts the effectiveness of these immune responses in question as well.

Also troubling is that my patient’s case, and others like his, may dim the hope for natural herd immunity. Herd immunity depends on the theory that our immune systems, once exposed to a pathogen, will collectively protect us as a community from reinfection and further spread.

There are several pathways out of this pandemic, including safe, effective, and available therapeutics and vaccines, as well as herd immunity (or some combination thereof).

Experts generally consider natural herd immunity a worst-case-scenario backup plan. It requires mass infection (and, in the case of Covid-19, massive loss of life because of the disease’s fatality rate) before protection takes hold. Herd immunity was promoted by experts in Sweden and (early on in the pandemic) in the UK, with devastating results.

Related A vaccine may not be enough to end the pandemic

Still, the dream of herd immunity, and the protection that a Covid-19 infection or a positive antibody test promises to provide, has taken hold among the public. As the collective reasoning has gone, the silver lining of surviving a Covid-19 infection (without debilitating side effects) is twofold: Survivors will not get infected again, nor will they pose a threat of passing the virus to their communities, workplaces, and loved ones.

While recent studies and reports have already questioned our ability to achieve herd immunity, our national discourse retains an implicit hope that herd immunity is possible. In recent weeks, leading medical experts have implied that the current surge in cases might lead to herd immunity by early 2021, and a July 6 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal was similarly optimistic.

This wishful thinking is harmful. It risks incentivizing bad behavior. The rare but concerning “Covid parties,” where people are gathering to deliberately get infected with the virus, and large gatherings without masks, are considered by some to be the fastest way out of the pandemic, personally and as a community. Rather than trying to wish ourselves out of scientific realities, we must acknowledge the mounting evidence that challenges these ideas.

In my opinion, my patient’s experience serves as a warning sign on several fronts.

First, the trajectory of a moderate initial infection followed by a severe reinfection suggests that this novel coronavirus might share some tendencies of other viruses such as dengue fever, where you can suffer more severe illness each time you contract the disease.

Second, despite scientific hopes for either antibody-mediated or cellular immunity, the severity of my patient’s second bout with Covid-19 suggests that such responses may not be as robust as we hope.

Third, many people may let their guard down after being infected because they believe they are either immune or incapable of contributing to community spread. As my patient’s case demonstrates, these assumptions risk both their own health and the health of those near them.

Last, if reinfection is possible on such a short timeline, there are implications for the efficacy and durability of vaccines developed to fight the disease.

I am aware that my patient represents a sample size of one, but taken together with other emerging examples, outlier stories like his are a warning sign of a potential pattern. If my patient is not, in fact, an exception but instead proves the rule, then many people could catch Covid-19 more than once, and with unpredictable severity.

With no certainty of personal immunity nor relief through herd immunity, the hard work of beating this pandemic together continues. Our efforts must go beyond simply waiting for effective treatments and vaccines. They must include continued prevention through the use of medically proven face masks, face shields, hand-washing, and physical distancing, as well as wide-scale testing, tracing, and isolation of new cases.

This is a novel disease: Learning curves are steep, and we must pay attention to the inconvenient truths as they arise. Natural herd immunity is almost certainly beyond our grasp. We cannot place our hopes on it.

"A climate denier is about to join the Supreme Court. Barrett belongs to the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal network with ties to climate deniers and polluting interests like Koch Industries and ExxonMobil. She used to work at a firm representing Exxon and Shell. Fossil fuel money wins again.",https://www.desmogblog.com/2020/10/14/amy-coney-barrett-not-scientist-climate-denier-supreme-court-federalist-society,"During her Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, October 13, Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett trotted out a tired and dismissive refrain from climate deniers, saying, “I’m certainly not a scientist” when Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) asked specifically about her views on climate change.

After Barrett said she doesn’t have “firm views” on the subject, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) pressed her on those views during the hearing Wednesday, where she continued to dodge the question. “I don’t think that my views on global warming or climate change are relevant to the job I would do as a judge,” Barrett said, adding, “I haven’t studied scientific data. I’m not really in a position to offer any informed opinion on what I think causes global warming.”

Her use of the “not a scientist” line, and her subsequent doubling down on the idea, drew swift criticism from activists, journalists, politicians, and other professionals engaged with the issue of climate change.

Barrett: “I'm certainly not a scientist. I have read things about climate change. I would not say I have firm views on it.”

Whether Barrett is truly a climate science denier herself remains unclear, though the president nominating her has left no doubt about his own stance on climate change. Despite President Trump's history of calling climate change a hoax and brushing aside the extensive scientific expertise of federal agencies on the subject, Barrett claimed she was unaware of the President's views when Sen. Blumenthal asked point-blank whether she agreed with Trump.

“I don’t know that I’ve seen the president’s expression of his views on climate change,” she said.

On climate change, the science is clear. The evidence is irrefutable.



Why isn't Amy Coney Barrett willing to acknowledge it? pic.twitter.com/xidTw0RSaV — Demand Justice (@WeDemandJustice) October 14, 2020

At the least, Barrett appears to identify with the broader conservative ideology that finds it acceptable to dismiss the overwhelming scientific consensus on the threat of climate change. Some activists have said this alone should be disqualifying for a Supreme Court nominee who would be presiding over cases on a range of issues including climate change, which scientists warn is a planetary emergency. For example, a number of lawsuits are winding through the courts right now that ultimately target the Supreme Court's landmark ruling upholding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's “Endangerment Finding” that greenhouse gases are pollutants that threaten public health due to climate change and therefore require regulation under the Clean Air Act.

Barrett does have ties through her and her family's work in corporate law firms to multi-national oil giants like Royal Dutch Shell, new research from the nonpartisan watchdog Accountable.US shows. Her father spent most of his career working as a lawyer for Shell Oil, and Barrett worked at the firm Baker Botts while the firm represented major oil corporations like Exxon and Shell. She has included Shell on her recusal list, according to Accountable.US, but the research also shows that as a judge she ruled in favor of corporate interests over people 76 percent of the time.

“Amy Coney Barrett’s record and views prove that she is anti-science, anti-environment, and an outright climate denier,” Accountable.US spokesperson Jayson O'Neill said in a statement.

Amy Coney Barrett is a climate denier. This is disqualifying.

Despite the scientific warnings, Republican politicians have for years downplayed the risks by peddling this “I’m not a scientist” talking point, basically a softer version of climate denial. Former President Barack Obama called this out during his State of the Union address in 2015. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has only recently stopped using this evasive line.

The fact that Barrett, who is soon set to be seated on the nation’s highest court, repeated it indicates just how pervasive climate-dismissive messaging has become among political conservatives. It also raises the concern that big business interests opposed to climate action are using dark money to effectively buy the judges they want in federal courts, including at the Supreme Court.

Senate Democrats released a report in May addressing this issue of dark money influence in the federal judiciary. According to that report, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority under Chief Justice John Roberts has handed down 80 decisions along partisan lines (by a 5-4 margin) that benefit conservative and corporate interests.

And 86 percent of President Trump’s nominees to federal appellate courts, including Barrett, have been members of the influential right-wing legal network the Federalist Society. Barrett, whom Trump appointed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, was an official member of the Federalist Society from 2005-2006 and 2014-2017 and continues to be affiliated with the organization.

The Federalist Society notably has ties to climate deniers and polluting interests like Koch Industries and ExxonMobil. As DeSmog’s database profile on the Federalist Society notes, “the Society has consistently published articles and hosted debates that frame investigations into ExxonMobil and think tanks that question the existence of man-made climate change as attacks on free speech. The group has also regularly hosted talks by individuals who oppose the mainstream consensus on manmade climate change including Willie Soon, Oren Cass, Steven Hayward, and others.”

Koch Foundations and Koch Industries have spent millions of dollars on the Federalist Society, and ExxonMobil has contributed at least $235,000. The Society is also part of a larger web of influence, fueled by dark money from undisclosed donors, that aims to “capture” the federal courts to serve the interests of Republican donors and corporate interests, according to the Senate Democrats’ “Captured Courts” report from May.

We’re launching a campaign to highlight how courts—with help from Sen. McConnell & Senate GOP—have been captured by dark money.



There's a twisted web of dark money invested to plant ideological activist judges & rewrite the Constitution.#CapturedCourtshttps://t.co/XRfnuAGBch — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 27, 2020

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a lead author of the report, used his time during Barrett’s confirmation hearing Tuesday to explain the dark money influence and right-wing organizations working behind the scenes to capture the federal courts with the help of entities like Donors Trust, a major funding arm of the climate denial movement. A 2015 DeSmog investigation found that Donors Trust has handled more than $479 million of untraceable funding between 2005 and 2012, an amount that has likely risen in the years since.

In particular, Sen. Whitehouse cited The Washington Post's 2019 investigation that found a $250 million, mostly dark-money effort by conservative activist Leonard Leo to push for conservative judges and causes. “Two hundred and fifty million dollars is a lot of money to spend if you’re not getting anything for it,” he said. “So that raises the question: What are they getting for it?”

If you’re watching #confirmation hearings for #AmyConeyBarrett, you saw a brilliant lecture by @SenWhitehouse about how the Right, fueled by Big Business dark money, has hijacked the courts to screw the average American. Barrett is the camera-ready capstone of a 30-year project. — howardfineman (@howardfineman) October 13, 2020

It’s the same funders selecting judges, funding campaigns for the judges and then showing up in courts in these orchestrated amicus flotillas and telling those judges what to do. It’s all one big #DarkMoney scheme. — Sheldon Whitehouse (@SenWhitehouse) October 14, 2020

The senator went on to call out how much of dark money operations appear aimed at efforts to weaken the power of regulatory agencies. “A lot of this money I’m convinced is polluter money. The Koch Industries is a polluter, the fossil fuel industry is a polluter. Who else would be putting buckets of money into this and wanting to hide who they are behind Donors Trust or other schemes?” Whitehouse said, pointing to a schematic listing groups and strategies including the Federalist Society and public relations and fake grassroots campaigns.

“Something is not right around the court, and dark money has a lot to do with it,” Whitehouse added.

Given the rise in dark money and the Federalist Society’s ties to climate deniers and polluters, it is perhaps not surprising that a former Federalist Society member like Barrett would cling to the dismissive “I’m not a scientist” refrain when questioned about her views on climate change. But, as some climate advocates point out, this longtime excuse of climate deniers should have no place in the Supreme Court.

As climate journalist and meteorologist Eric Holthaus wrote in his new newsletter The Phoenix on Tuesday night, “It’s a really big deal — and a sign of a complete failure of our democracy — to be confirming a climate denier to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court during a moment when urgent climate action is an existential priority.”

Wilderness across the planet is disappearing on a huge scale, according to a new study that found human activities had converted an area the size of Mexico from virtually intact natural landscapes to heavily modified ones in just 13 years.

The loss of 1.9m square kilometres (735,000 sq miles) of intact ecosystems would have “profound implications” for the planet’s biodiversity, the study’s authors said.

Using mostly satellite imagery, 17 scientists across six countries examined the human footprint across the globe and how it had changed between 2000 and 2013.

Almost 20% of the earth’s surface had deteriorated, the study found, while human pressure had eased on only six per cent of the planet.

Russia, Canada, Brazil, and Australia held the largest intact areas, together responsible for 60% of the world’s most untouched places.

Some 1.1m sq km (425,000 sq miles) of wilderness identified from imagery in 2000 had some human impact 13 years later.

Tropical savannahs and grasslands lost the most area to human pressure, the study, published in the journal One Earth, found.

Lead researcher Brooke Williams, of the University of Queensland, told the Guardian: “We were expecting there to be high levels of intact ecosystem and wilderness loss, but the results were shocking.

“We found substantial area of intact ecosystems had been lost in just 13 years – nearly two million square kilometres – which is terrifying to think about. Our findings show that human pressure is extending ever further into the last ecologically intact and wilderness areas.”

Rainforests in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea that were both rich with species had lost large areas to human activities. Conversion of habitats to cash crops, including palm oil, was a big contributor to the losses.

The study did not try to identify the cause of the losses, but Williams said the direct clearing of landscapes for farming was a known major driver.

Co-author Prof James Watson, also of the University of Queensland and the global conservation group the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: ‘The data does not lie. Humanity keeps on shrinking the amount of land that other species need to survive.”

“In a time of rapid climate change, we need to proactively secure the last intact ecosystems on the planet, as these are critical in the fight to stop extinction and halt climate change,” Watson said.

Looking across 221 nation states, only 26 had at least half of their land intact, the study found. In 2013, 41% of the world’s surface was either wilderness or was mostly intact.

Williams, who is also a conservationist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the losses undermined efforts to mitigate climate change because intact lands acted as storage spaces for carbon dioxide.

She said: “Proactively protecting Earth’s intact ecosystems is humanity’s best mechanism for protecting against climate change, ensuring large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes persist, and safeguarding biological diversity into the future.”

The paper’s authors write: “Halting the loss of intact ecosystems cannot be achieved alongside current trajectories of development, population growth, and resource consumption.”

Prof Bill Laurance, the director of James Cook University’s centre for tropical environmental and sustainability science in Queensland, who was not involved in the study, said its findings were scary.

“Humans are trashing much of the planet – no doubt about that,” he said. “The tropics are under particular pressure, and it’s not just forest destruction but also the loss of other habitat types, such as tropical savannahs and native grasslands, that are occurring apace.”

He said it was notable that tropical grasslands were heavily impacted because these were more easily converted to pasture or farmland. Declines in rainforests in south-east Asia were also “among the biologically richest ecosystems on Earth”.

One example, he said, was the rainforests of Sumatra that were home to critically endangered species of orangutan, as well as tigers, elephants and rhinos. That country’s forests were either gone or being devastated.

He said: “If we don’t halt such changes, we’re going to see the continued rapid disruption and loss of Earth’s ecosystems, including the biologically richest habitats on the planet. And along with that will be continued declines in the quality of life for people.”

The study comes after research earlier this week found that protected areas around the world, such as national parks and world heritage areas, were becoming isolated.

Only about 10% of the world’s protected areas were connected to similar habitats outside their borders.

The research, in the journal Nature Climate Change, warned that as the globe warmed, species would look to move. But if protected areas were isolated, those species would have nowhere to go."
"People no longer believe working hard will lead to a better life, survey shows",https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/2020-edelman-trust-barometer-shows-growing-sense-of-inequality/11883788?fbclid=IwAR09iusXpbCQ6BM5Fmsk4MVBN3OWIk2L5E8UbQKFwjg6nWpLHKgMGP2UTfM,"A growing sense of inequality is undermining trust in both society's institutions and capitalism, according to a long-running global survey.

The 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer - now in its 20th year - has found many people no longer believe working hard will give them a better life.

Despite strong economic performance, a majority of respondents in every developed market do not believe they will be better off in five years' time.

This means that economic growth no longer appears to drive trust, at least in developed markets - upending the conventional wisdom.

""We are living in a trust paradox,"" said Richard Edelman, CEO of Edelman.

""Since we began measuring trust 20 years ago, economic growth has fostered rising trust. This continues in Asia and the Middle East but not in developed markets, where national income inequality is now the more important factor.

Fears are stifling hope, and long-held assumptions about hard work leading to upward mobility are now invalid.

Growing 'trust chasm' between elites and the public

Fifty-six per cent of the surveyed global population said capitalism in its current form does more harm than good in the world.

Most employees (83 percent) globally are worried about job loss due to automation, a looming recession, lack of training, cheaper foreign competition, immigration and the gig economy.

Fifty-seven percent of respondents worry about losing the respect and dignity they once enjoyed in their country.

Nearly two in three feel the pace of technological change is too fast. Australia recorded one of the largest declines of trust in technology.

Australians were most worried about losing their job to the gig economy, followed by recession, lack of training, and foreign competitors.

The study also found a growing ""trust chasm"" between elites and the public that could be a reflection of income inequality, Edelman said.

We now observe an Alice in Wonderland moment of elite buoyancy and mass despair,"" he said.

While 65 per cent of the worldwide informed public (aged 25-65, university-educated, in the top 25 per cent of household income) said they trust their institutions, only 51 per cent of the mass public (everyone else, representing 83 per cent of the total global population) said the same.

""The result is a world of two different trust realities,"" the report says.

""The informed public - wealthier, more educated, and frequent consumers of news - remain far more trusting of every institution than the mass population.

""In a majority of markets, less than half of the mass population trust their institutions to do what is right.

""There are now a record eight markets showing all-time-high gaps between the two audiences - an alarming trust inequality.""

Trust levels among the informed public in Australia were at 68 per cent, far higher than the 45 per cent recorded among the mass population."
"Humanity will be “finished” if we fail to drastically change our food systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, the prominent naturalist Jane Goodall has warned.",http://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jun/03/jane-goodall-humanity-is-finished-if-it-fails-to-adapt-after-covid-19,"Humanity will be “finished” if we fail to drastically change our food systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, the prominent naturalist Jane Goodall has warned.

She blamed the emergence of Covid-19 on the over-exploitation of the natural world, which has seen forests cut down, species made extinct and natural habitats destroyed. The coronavirus is thought to have made the jump from animals to humans late last year, possibly originating in a meat market in Wuhan, China.

Intensive farming was also creating a reservoir of animal diseases that would spill over and hurt human society, said Goodall, one of the world’s foremost experts on chimpanzees and a longtime conservation campaigner, speaking alongside two European commissioners at an online event held by the campaigning group Compassion in World Farming, on Tuesday.

“We have brought this on ourselves because of our absolute disrespect for animals and the environment,” she said. “Our disrespect for wild animals and our disrespect for farmed animals has created this situation where disease can spill over to infect human beings.”

People must move away from factory farming and stop destroying natural habitats as a matter of urgency, she said, because of the threat of diseases and of climate breakdown. Factory farming is linked to the rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs, which threaten human health.

“If we do not do things differently, we are finished,” she said. “We can’t go on very much longer like this.”

She called for people to be lifted out of poverty, pointing to its strong impact on the natural world, as people with no alternatives and who are desperate to feed their families will cut down forests to survive, and in urban areas will choose the cheapest food whatever the harm caused by its production, because they have little other choice.

War and violence also fuelled the destruction of nature, she warned, and so did our overweening consumerism and urge for “stuff that we accumulate”, as well as our diets.

The wealthy should put pressure on leaders and take care over what they buy to avoid adding to the problem, she said. “We have got to stop buying their products,” she said, of companies that use factory farming and exploit nature.

“We have come to a turning point in our relationship with the natural world,” she warned, saying there was only a small window of opportunity to make drastic changes before facing disaster. “One of the lessons learnt from this crisis is that we must change our ways. Scientists warn that to avoid future crises, we must drastically change our diets and move to plant-rich foods. For the sake of the animals, planet and the health of our children.”

Stella Kyriakides, the EU’s commissioner for health and food safety, said the EU was responding to concerns through its newly unveiled agriculture and biodiversity strategies and the European Green Deal. These strategies would cut the use of pesticides and encourage biodiversity, she said.

“Highly intensive farming systems have created an abundance of food but in Europe, at least, there is also significant waste and at times animal suffering,” she told the conference. “These phenomena deeply worry me. The parts that don’t work are ethically questionable and socially and environmentally unacceptable. Our citizens expect more and we will deliver a better balance to ensure farming practices are sustainable and food is affordable.”

Janusz Wojciechowski, commissioner for agriculture, added: “We will constantly support sustainable farming and breeding practices as an alternative to intensive industrial farming.”

Concern about the links between coronavirus and the exploitation of the natural world is growing. Eighteen conservation groups have joined together in the Campaign to End Wildlife Trading, which is urging Boris Johnson to call for a global wildlife trade ban when the G20 leaders meet this November.

The groups say that such a ban is needed to end the exploitation of wildlife for traditional medicine, exotic pets, tourism and other purposes. Currently, the trade in some endangered species is banned but still rife. It is one of the biggest forms of illegal trafficking in the world, after people and drugs. The legal trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, according to the campaign.

Intensive farming’s links to disease outbreaks were examined by the FAIRR global investor network in a new report, which found that more than 70% of the biggest meat, fish and dairy producers were in danger of fostering future zoonotic pandemics owing to lax safety standards, closely confined animals and the overuse of antibiotics.

Meat companies have been under pressure in the US, where the spread of Covid-19 has led to plant closures and disruption of the supply chain. In the longer term, according to FAIRR, the meat supply chain is likely to come under further pressure because of increased scrutiny and regulation needed to improve biosecurity.

Jeremy Coller, founder of FAIRR and CIO of Coller Capital, said: “Factory farming is both vulnerable to pandemics and guilty of creating them. It’s a self-sabotaging cycle that destroys value and risks lives. To avoid causing the next pandemic, the meat industry must tackle lax safety standards for food and workers alike, closely confined animals, and overused antibiotics. Covid could be the straw that breaks the meat industry’s back.”"
"American workers lose $15 billion to wage theft by their employers every year, more than all of the property crime in the United States put together.",https://ponderwall.com/index.php/2019/04/30/cheating-workers-wages/,"Employees lose $15 billion to wage theft every year, more than all of the property crime in the United States put together.

Labor laws are often based on how we worked decades ago.

Jara Neal Willis, a nurse at a hospital in Texas, usually clocked in a few minutes before the start of her shift and stayed late whenever her patients needed help. Her lunch breaks were often cut short by requests from doctors, patients or their families.

Willis and her colleagues, however, claimed they were not paid for those extra few minutes worked before and after their shifts. Or for working during lunch breaks.

It wasn’t because of mischievous gremlins falsifying their time cards in a backroom, but settings in the software the hospital used to track comings and goings. Two features alone, “rounding” and “automatic break deductions,” could result in the loss of up to 44 minutes a day – or US$1,382 a year at the federal minimum wage.

Timekeeping software was the focus of a study I co-authored last year documenting how it could be used to facilitate wage theft.

But it left a lingering question: Did companies actually use these features to shortchange workers? Based on my review of hundreds of lawsuits like Willis’, the answer is yes – and it’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Wage theft gets a tech upgrade

“Wage theft” is a shorthand term that refers to situations in which someone isn’t paid for the work. In its simplest form, it might consist of a manager instructing employees to work off the clock. Or a company refusing to pay for overtime hours.

A report from the Economic Policy Institute estimated that employees lose $15 billion to wage theft every year, more than all of the property crime in the United States put together.

That report, however, focused on workers being paid less than the federal or state minimum wage. Our 2017 study, which was based on promotional materials, employer policies and YouTube videos, suggested that companies can now use software to avoid paying all sorts of hourly workers.

Hundreds and hundreds

When an employee clocks in for the day – using a computer login, ID badge or phone – that employee’s time log becomes a form of data.

I wanted to know if there was any evidence that employers have ever used rounding and automatic break deductions to change that data, to their workers’ detriment. So I did what law professors normally do in such situations: I ran a search of legal opinions to see if there were any cases in which workers sought to reclaim wages lost through digital wage theft.

Before our study, I hadn’t even heard of this practice, so I expected to find only a handful of cases. Instead, I found hundreds and hundreds of legal opinions involving digital wage theft. And this suggests there are hundreds more because, typically, for every case that results in a legal opinion many more do not.

I decided to read a bunch to get a flavor for what employees were claiming and a window into how employers were using the software. I eventually stopped after wading through more than 300 cases, which are described in a study published in the American Business Law Journal.

The study’s methodology does not support quantitative inferences about how often digital wage theft occurs or how much money U.S. workers have lost to these practices over time.

But what I can say is that this is not a theoretical problem. Real workers have lost real money to these practices.

Rounding away

Rounding – the functionality used to nickel and dime workers like Jara Willis – is a convenient way for companies to consistently reclaim employee hours.

Even though the software can precisely record the time an employee clocks in and out, the “rounding” functionality changes that time according to a preset increment. Companies argue they use it to increase payroll predictability.

The preferred rounding increment in the cases I reviewed appeared to be to the quarter hour. So arriving to work at 8:53 a.m. would be rounded to 9, while 8:52 would become 8:45.

In theory, employees could even the odds when it comes to rounding by carefully timing their arrivals and departures. They could show up late or leave early, or punch in extra early or leave extra late.

But companies have two extra weapons to corral employee punches to work in their favor: policies and discipline. Yes, you could show up late or leave early, but then you’d be flagged for discipline under the attendance policy.

Sometimes employers in these cases further stacked the deck by prohibiting workers from punching in more than seven minutes early. Others actually “invited” employees to punch in up to seven minutes early, labeling it a “grace period,” as though it were an accommodation to workers.

Willis’ hospital, however, took a highly unusual approach to persuading workers to clock in during periods that favored the hospital. According to testimony from that case, supervisors labeled any employee who clocked in too early or out too late, thereby gaining minutes under the rounding system, a “moocher.”

One manager even posted “no mooching” signs with a picture of a cow and a clock in the hospital hallway.

Working the odds

Rounding works the odds, sort of like a casino. And in fact, some of the cases I reviewed actually involved casino workers, perhaps because they are especially attuned to statistics and realize they’re on the wrong side of the equation.

In one case brought by casino workers, the plaintiff’s expert estimated that the 2,100 employees who opted into the lawsuit lost 87,710 hours over a five-year period, or roughly $950,000 at their $10.80 average hourly rate.

But the company’s rounding policy actually covered 28,000 employees. If those workers were similarly affected by the policy, that would have meant a loss of about 1.17 million hours, or $12.6 million in wages the company was able to reclaim through the rounding policy over five years.

The case settled for $450,000, about half of which went to attorneys’ fees. In other words, even though this particular company was caught, dragged through litigation and forced to settle, it still would have made a hefty profit from its rounding policy. That’s not exactly a deterrent.

Unpaid breaks

Employers also reclaim time through what is known as “automatic break deductions.” The software assumes that you took your full meal break, even if you didn’t.

In some workplaces, taking a lunch break can be difficult, especially for those providing patient care in hospitals and nursing homes. Studies of nurses suggest that they are completely unable to take breaks in about 10 percent of shifts and aren’t relieved of duty for meals and breaks in about 40 percent.

In the cases I reviewed, companies didn’t make it easy for workers to override the break deduction. Employees complained that they didn’t have authorization to do so and instead had to fill out an extra paper form. Or ask their supervisor for approval. Or both.

Companies even discouraged workers from doing so. A nurse received an “action plan” from her hospital after requesting too many break overrides. Rather than fixing the staffing problems that led to the missed breaks, the hospital recommended that she “keep snacks in her office.”

Outdated wage legal rules

So how did this problem come about in the first place?

These types of employer abuses are made possible by half-century-old rules that permitted rounding because at the time companies had to calculate hours by hand.

The outdated regulations assume that rounding will “average out” in the long term, essentially forcing workers to prove that they don’t – as in the cases I reviewed.

That leaves employers free to use rounding because it’s theoretically possible that it all might average out. And because collective litigation to recover lost wages requires affected workers to “opt in” to a class action suit, only a small fraction of workers ever get their money back.

What’s more, the outdated regulations don’t even mention automatic break deductions. That leaves courts struggling to figure out what’s fair in cases where there often isn’t even an electronic record of the missed break.

This problem is not going away. As long as these regulatory loopholes exist, employers and software makers will find ways to exploit them. That means if you’re paid an hourly wage, you may very well be losing out.

Revealed: Trump-linked consultant tied to Facebook pages warning election will cause civil war,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/04/revealed-trump-linked-consultant-facebook-pages-warning-election-cause-civil-war,"A militia-promoting father and son duo of fake news publishers and a Trump-connected social media consultant are linked to pages which promote the idea of an American civil war with material presented in a way that appears to be an effort to sidestep Facebook’s fact-checking system.

Comments on their Facebook pages and other materials obtained by the Guardian show that some rank and file Donald Trump supporters are enthusiastically receiving the message that they should prepare for violence against their perceived political enemies in November.

The network is comprised of websites owned and operated by Dino Porrazzo Sr and Dino Porrazzo Jr, whose company, AFF Media, is headquartered in Pinon Hills in California. The pair have been running rightwing websites since at latest 2013, according to DNS website records.

The Porrazzos now run a network of websites that enthusiastically promote Trump, and far right anti-government militias like the Three Percenters, and offer distorted versions of current events. One of their Facebook pages, “Prepare to Take America Back” (PTTAB) at the time of reporting had 794,876 followers. Analysis with social media metrics tool Crowdtangle shows that over the last three months PTTAB posts have been shared over 141,000 times, and on average 9,600 times a week.

At that time, the page’s header featured the logo of the Three Percenters, a decentralized group that the ADL calls a “wing of the militia movement”; a group of armed men in tactical gear; and a modified copy of the US presidential seal.

In general, the page promotes conspiracy theories and criminal allegations about Democratic party politicians, liberal celebrities and leftist protesters, some of which – like persistent claims that Hillary Clinton will be imminently arrested – overlap with aspects of the so-called “QAnon” conspiracy theory movement.

The page makes free use of political memes, but many posts link to a small cluster of rightwing websites designed to appear like news outlets. Increasingly, over the course of 2020, the page has been warning of a stolen election, and suggesting this will lead to civil war.

Repeatedly in September, the page linked to a story on the website Right Wing Tribune, headlined “Radical Left Prepares For ‘Mass Public Unrest,’ ‘Political Apocalypse’ And Possible Civil War Should Be Expected If Biden Loses [Opinion]”, with Facebook captions including “the left wants war”.

The story had a limited basis in fact, in that a number of progressive groups had met in early September to discuss the prospect of civil unrest and political violence after the election with a belief that the violence they were anticipating would be coming from Trump supporters and the far right.

Nevertheless, the Right Wing Tribune piece concluded with a conspiracy theory: “These groups are heavily focused on removing President Trump from office as well as different scenarios which all lead to a second revolution in which they control our nation as a “New America”.”

Similarly distorted stories warning of a “siege of the white house”, peppered the page throughout September and warnings of a post-election civil war were posted over the last year.

Last November, the page linked to a site called Flag and Cross, and a story which it described as an “excellent opinion piece”, entitled “Winning the New Civil War (OPINION)”.

The piece claimed on the basis of antifascist protests and comments by Democratic politicians that, “We have many strong indications that this is a hot war”.

The transparency page for PTTAB discloses that PTTAB is managed by Southern California-based AFF Media Inc, and that the Vici Media Group “partners with this page”.

According to California records, AFF Media was incorporated on Donald Trump’s inauguration day, 20 January 2017; in other documents, Dino Porrazzo Jr is listed as CEO and CFO, and Dino Porrazzo Sr as secretary. But the Guardian has discovered that the Porrazzos are further involved in running a dizzying array of interconnected sites and social media pages. The Annenberg Public Policy initiative lists two of their websites on its “Misinformation Directory” of “websites that have posted deceptive content”.

One of the listed sites is Right Wing Tribune. But all of the other sites linked to by the PTTAB Facebook page also appear to belong to AFF, with similar design, shared bylines and shared source code.

This is not some dark corner of the Internet, this is not a fringe thing, it’s mainstream Republicans. Becca Lewis, Stanford University

The Porrazzos have been previously reported as having links to the Three Percenters, a decentralized, national militia movement that the Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes as anti-government extremists.

Becca Lewis researches online extremism and disinformation at Stanford University. In a telephone conversation, she said that the page and the associated websites represented a sophisticated effort to skirt Facebook’s fact-checking efforts.

“It seems as though they are being very strategic in their messaging so as to not be shut down,” Lewis said, adding that viewing the ostentatious labeling of opinion as an effort to sidestep fact-checking is “absolutely a reasonable assumption”.

In June, Heated reported that climate change deniers were exploiting the same loophole to “make any climate disinformation ineligible for fact-checking by deeming it “opinion”. In August, NBC reported that Facebook had systematically relaxed its fact-checking rules for conservative outlets and personalities.

In a telephone conversation, Dino Porrazzo Jr asserted that PTTAB had had “zero fact-check violations”, characterizing his websites as “opinion websites based on fact”. Asked if they were fact-checked at all, Porrazzo said “no”, but added: “I don’t work at Facebook”. Asked if he thought that there really was a civil war coming, Porrazzo accused the Guardian of “writing a hit piece to get me thrown off Facebook”, and then ended the conversation.

Facebook Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Porrazzos also have links to Republican officials.

The registered agent for the company is an elected official in California, Ensen Mason, who was elected as San Bernardino county auditor-controller in California as a nonpartisan candidate, but who is listed as a member of the San Bernardino Republican party.

In an email, however, Ensen Mason said that in relation to the Porrazzos, his accounting firm’s role “is strictly limited to accounting services and registered agent”.

The Vici Media Group, meanwhile, is run by Patrick Mauldin, who is a social media consultant for the Trump campaign and other Republican politicians, and his brother, Ryan.

The company was hired in 2016 by one-time Trump campaign manager and recently-resigned campaign consultant, Brad Parscale, to be part of the team that was widely credited with winning Trump the election. In June, Patrick Mauldin was identified as the creator of a fake Joe Biden site that was compared in New York Times reporting to “disinformation spread by Russian trolls”.

In an email, Ryan Mauldin disavowed the Porrazzos’ publishing output, writing, “Vici Media Group was engaged for a small, non-content-related project by the managers of the page.”

Mauldin added, “We have no input on the content published by the various sites or the comments made on that content. We are not working for the Trump campaign.”

Mauldin did not immediately respond to attempts to further clarify the nature of their work for the Porrazzos, and to clarify New York Times reporting as recent as June 2020 that said Patrick Mauldin was on a retainer for the Trump campaign, and considered a “rising star”.

Porrazzo refused to specify the nature of AFF’s relationship with Vici Media Group.

Meanwhile, the content of the Porrazzo pages does appear to trigger extreme responses among users. Hundreds of user comments on the page’s posts suggest the use of violence against perceived political enemies. On a 5 September post linking to a Right Wing Tribune article suggesting that Democrats will foment civil war if Biden loses, one user commented, “a short civil war with the democrats and those who support socialist policies will go a long way to help Make America Great Again”.

Another connects civil war to their belief that a Trump loss is impossible, writing “If [Biden] wins, it’ll be from fraud on an industrial scale, and the lesson that’ll have to be taught for that will necessarily be no less industrial.”

Many welcome the prospect of armed conflict – one writes “That’s fine with me open season on democrats!”. Another deployed accused murderer Kyle Rittenhouse as a positive example, writing “I think it will be more whining, crying, rioting, looting and a lot of Kyles protecting their cities, towns and neighborhoods.”

Asked to comment on the site’s apparent reach, and the nature of its community, Lewis, the extremism researcher, said: “This is not some dark corner of the internet, this is not a fringe thing, it’s mainstream Republicans that are stoking this.”

On links to the Trump campaign, she said that the distorted content and the violent user comments formed a kind of “feedback loop”, and that “Trump and his campaign staff have been masters at exploiting these feedback loops”.

On Tuesday night, meanwhile, following the Guardian’s outreach to the Porrazzos and Facebook that day, Dino Porrazzo announced on Twitter that he “HAD TO DELETE A FEW ARTICLES I WROTE TODAY BECAUSE THEY WERE DEMED FALSE BY BASEMENT DWELLING LIBERAL FACT CHECKERS”."
Pakistan To Hire Pandemic's Unemployed to Plant 10 Billion Trees,http://www.occupy.com/article/pakistan-hire-pandemic-s-unemployed-plant-10-billion-trees#sthash.I4yaXLV2.dpbs,"Pakistan To Hire Pandemic's Unemployed to Plant 10 Billion Trees

The novel coronavirus has driven thousands of people into unemployment around the world, and while many countries are struggling to tackle the issue, Pakistan has started recruiting the unemployed as ""jungle workers"" to build its ambitious “10 Billion Tree plantation” initiative aimed at greening the nation.

The mega-tree planting scheme is part of Pakistan’s five-year-plan to replicate its earlier success of the Billion Tree Tsunami Projectcarried out in its North West province.

Pakistan says the initiative to plant 10 billion trees will not only translate into an immediate source of income for about 150,000 people left jobless during the pandemic, but will foster environmental awareness in an impoverished, drought-plagued country where vast swaths of forest have been stripped.

According to the World Bank, forest now covers only 2 percent of all Pakistan, a fraction of the country's former forest density.

The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics estimated COVID-19 could result in more than 10 million people in the country losing their jobs.

In response, workers with the ""10 Billion Tree plantation"" stand to earn a meager $3 a day planting saplings – enough nonetheless to feed their families and keep parts of the economy running. Government officials say thousands of the new “jungle jobs” have been created, and that by planting vast rows of tiny trees, workers will be helping the country combat the challenges of climate change.

Lockdown restrictions in Pakistan have been eased to allow workers to continue the job while wearing masks and maintaining social distancing to avoid catching the virus.

Pakistan has suffered some of Asia’s worst deforestation and remains among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Its mountain glaciers are already melting, causing rivers to flood. The World Bank reports that climate change crises have already cost Pakistan $3.8 billion since 1998.

More than 5,000 glaciers remain in northern Pakistan, but many of them are melting at a much faster rate than anticipated because of soaring temperatures in the country's mountainous valleys, reported Pakistan's ministry of climate change.

Between 2004 and 2018, Pakistan successfully completed its first “billion tree Tsunami project,” boosting confidence that it can now execute a “10 Billion Tree Tsunami” at a budget of around $1 billion. The project is about not just planting trees but also conserving and surveying wildlife and creating at least seven national parks.

The government hopes to receive a grant of between $3 and $6 billion from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, part of which will be used to launch other clean, green projects in Pakistan's cities.

“We have involved local communities to make people understand how trees are important for our future and how Pakistan is vulnerable to climate change,” Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said. Besides those made recently unemployed by the virus, women in mountainous areas have also been hired by the project to grow saplings in nurseries.

Pakistani officials said practical efforts on the tree project won't be greatly affected by the pandemic, since tree planting takes place in the plains, mountains and open-air, where there is little chance of the virus spreading.

Noorin Mustafa, an official associated with the 10 billion tree plantation project, told regional media that before this initiative the billion tree Tsunami generated more than half a million jobs, and ""therefore the government hopes that the project of 10 billion trees has more potential to include several thousand labourers to reduce the ratio of unemployment caused by the new virus.""

According to Mustafa, the current phase of the project, which involves planting about three billion trees, requires a large amount of fieldwork, which is why the government has issued instructions to the provinces to speed up the work.

An official of Pakistan’s forest department who is directly involved in the tree plantation said that following the federal government's directives for regions to hire more workers, some 19,000 people in one province alone, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have already been recruited to plant. ""The government has set a target of planting 240 million trees this season and it is expected that 60 percent of this has already been achieved,"" he said.

Javiria Ahir, parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, announced that steps would be taken to also recruit Pakistanis returning home after they've been laid off by companies abroad, especially in Gulf countries.

According to one government estimate, the project will initially employ 150,000 people affected by the pandemic, providing them an income of up to $100 dollars per month.

However, some environmentalists have criticized the move to hire regular labourers as tree planters, saying that planting and caring for plants ""is not the job of ordinary day labourers, but the work of people who understand plants,” according to an environmentalist statement."

A remarkable and nightmarish scene playing out in Portland should terrify anyone who cares about the US constitution,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/18/portland-oregon-federal-officers-trump-department-homeland-security,"A remarkable and nightmarish scene playing out in Portland should terrify anyone who cares about the US constitution: unmarked vans full of camouflaged and unidentified federal agents are pulling up next to protesters on street corners, then snatching and arresting them with no explanation.

If this were happening in Venezuela or Iran, the US government would be threatening international sanctions. Since it’s happening in the US, Trump’s acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary is defending the decision and even promising more.

The stories from witnesses and those who have been picked up by the unmarked vans – apparently being operated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is under DHS’s control – are downright terrifying. One victim told the New York Times: “One of the officers said, ‘It’s OK, it’s OK,’ and just grabbed me and threw me into the van. Another officer pulled my beanie down, so I couldn’t see.”

The same person told the Washington Post: “I was terrified. It seemed like it was out of a horror/sci-fi, like a Philip K Dick novel. It was like being preyed upon.” Still another told Portland’s Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB): “I see guys in camo. Four or five of them pop out, open the door and it was just like, ‘Oh shit. I don’t know who you are or what you want with us.’”

The incidents being described sound eerily reminiscent of the CIA’s post-9/11 rendition program under George W Bush, where intelligence agents would roll up in unmarked vans in foreign countries, blindfold terrorism suspects (many of whom turned to be innocent) and kidnap them without explanation. Only instead of occurring on the streets of Italy or the Middle East, it’s happening in downtown Portland.

Virtually all of Portland’s local leaders, as well as Oregon’s leading representatives in Congress, have condemned the situation and called for an investigation. But so far, DHS and the Trump administration do not seem deterred.

The acting secretary of DHS, Chad Wolf, released a video statement Friday lamenting that Portland had declined the department’s “offer” of “support”. So DHS went ahead and sent in its thugs anyway. DHS’s list of reasons for invading Portland and implementing its terror operation, amid what it calls “rampant long-lasting violence”, consists mostly of graffiti incidents and minor property damage.

Their authoritarianism is no longer creeping – the DHS and CBP are acting as full-on secret police

Portland is almost 400 miles from the Canadian border and 80 miles from the Pacific ocean, by the way. It’s unclear what legal authority, if any, allows CBP to be terrorizing the streets to hunt down graffiti artists—even if they think they can operate anywhere that’s 100 miles from a border. In other words, it’s illegal, or it should be.

Worse, judging from witnesses, CBP isn’t just “defending” federal buildings, as it claims. As OPB reported: “Interviews ... show officers are also detaining people on Portland streets who aren’t near federal property, nor is it clear that all of the people being arrested have engaged in criminal activity.” Protesters told OPB they “think they were targeted by federal officers for simply wearing black clothing in the area of the demonstration”.

CBP has also reportedly indiscriminately fired teargas at protesters despite a judge banning Portland’s police from doing so, permanently injured a person with a shot to the head from a so-called “less lethal” gun, and fired its weapons at at least one journalist.

DHS, even in the pre-Trump era, has been an enormous waste of taxpayer resources, full of massive government waste and abuse, and a civil liberties disaster to boot. Back in 2015, I called for it to be abolished in the pages of the Guardian. Under Trump it has reached new levels of depravity. Its disturbing anti-immigration actions have shown agents seemingly going out of their way to be as cruel as possible to those they apprehend.

Anyone only has to read the news from the past few weeks to witness DHS’s corruption and creeping authoritarianism: in one story, government auditors have found that the CBP spent money meant for food and medical supplies for detained migrants on ATVs and dirt bikes for themselves. In another, DHS deployed Predator drones, helicopters and airplanes to spy on Black Lives Matter protesters in 15 American cities.

With their actions in Portland, their authoritarianism is no longer creeping – the DHS and CBP are acting as full-on secret police. If there are not steep consequences for these disturbing actions, there will be no limits on where this will lead."
Almost 40% or Americans Who Lost Their Jobs Due to Covid Can't Last a Month On Savings,https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/nearly-40-of-americans-who-lost-their-jobs-during-pandemic-cant-last-a-month-on-savings,"More than one-third of Americans who lost their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and related economic recession cannot last more than one month on their savings.

That's according to a new study from SimplyWise, which found that 38% of Americans who either lost a job or had their income reduced during the crisis did not have enough money stashed away to live off of it for longer than a month.

One in five respondents said their savings would last just two weeks – an alarming statistic that comes just three weeks after the supplemental $600-a-week in unemployment benefits expired for some 30 million Americans.

TRUMP'S PAYROLL TAX DEFERRAL MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT TAX BILLS FOR WORKERS, BUSINESS GROUPS WARN

The pandemic, which triggered an unprecedented shutdown of the nation's economy, has caused the worst unemployment crisis since the Great Depression.

The Labor Department's July jobs report released at the beginning of August showed that employers added 1.8 million jobs last month, sending the unemployment rate down to 10.2%.

While it marked the third consecutive month of job growth in the millions, the economy has so far added back less than half – about 42 percent – of the 22 million jobs it lost during the pandemic.

When the $600-a-week federal benefit lapsed at the end of July, the typical unemployment check returned to an average of $330 per week for most Americans, a significant benefit cut for individuals collecting the aid.

Forty-two percent of adults said they could not come up with $500 in cash without selling something or taking out a loan, according to the survey. The percentage was even higher among laid-off workers, at 61%.

There was also a racial divide in the data. Sixty-three percent of Black Americans said they could not come up with $500 in cash, compared to 35% of White Americans.

SimplyWise conducted its online survey of 1,128 American adults in early July, before the sweetened jobless aid expired.

"Hungarian prime minister Victor Orban granted sweeping new powers that allows him to rule by decree indefinitely, and jail people up to 5 years for spreading ""misinformation"" about the virus.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/hungary-grants-pm-orban-sweeping-new-powers-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74902238.cms,"BUDAPEST: Hungary ’s parliament endorsed a bill on Monday giving nationalist premier Viktor Orban sweeping new powers he says he needs to fight the new coronavirus pandemic. Critics at home and abroad have condemned the “anticoronavirus defence law”, saying it gives Orban unnecessary and unlimited power in a ruse to cement his leadership rather than battle the virus.After declaring a state of emergency on March 11, the new bill will give Orban the power to largely rule by decree indefinitely until the government decides the pandemic crisis is over. The bill removes the current requirement for MPs to approve any extension to time limits on the decrees.It also introduces jail terms of up to five years for anyone spreading “falsehoods” about the virus or the measures against it, stoking new worries for press freedom. It was passed by 137 votes to 53 by parliament’s lower chamber, where Orban’s Fidesz party has a twothirds majority.Since taking power in 2010, the self-styled “illiberal” nationalist has transformed Hungary’s political, judicial and constitutional landscape.The 56-year-old has frequently clashed with European institutions, NGOs and rights groups with Brussels suing Hungary for “breaching” EU values — charges fiercely denied by Budapest . Orban has given criticism of the coronavirus law short shrift, accusing critics of alarmism and appealing to “European nit-pickers” to let Hungary defend itself against Covid-19.His justice minister, Judit Varga, told foreign reporters Friday that parliament could revoke the decrees at any time, and that the opposition were “fighting imaginary demons and not dealing with reality.”"
Over 55 Climate Scientists Call BS on Joe Biden's Claim No Scientists Support Bernie Sanders' Climate Plan,https://earther.gizmodo.com/over-55-climate-scientists-call-bs-on-joe-bidens-claim-1841318428,"Former Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, right, at a January 2020 presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa.

Over 55 scientists have signed an open letter rebuking Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden’s claim that the climate plan rival contender Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders supports, the Green New Deal, isn’t supported by anyone in the scientific field.

Sanders has proposed spending $16.3 trillion through 2030 to radically reshape the U.S. economy, including $2.37 trillion to renewable energy and storage, over $2 trillion in grants for low- and middle-income families as well as small businesses to buy electric vehicles, and $964 billion in grants for those groups to electrify gas and propane heating systems. His plan also calls for $526 billion on a smart electric grid and hundreds of billions on replacing diesel trucks and buses and new mass transit and high-speed rail lines.

Biden’s plan, while still more sweeping than any prior federal effort to address climate change, calls for $1.7 trillion in new spending and only arrived after immense pressure from environmentalists to detail a concrete approach. Biden has also called for ending fossil fuel subsidies across the G20, a stark departure from his tenure in the Obama administration, when domestic crude oil production skyrocketed by 77 percent. It’s far from nothing, but that hasn’t blunted criticism that it’s not as ambitious as it claims to be on the tin.

But the vice president is insisting that doing more isn’t realistic. Last week, Biden attacked Sanders’ plan, telling reporters in New Hampshire that “there’s not a single solitary scientist that thinks it can work,” adding that he doesn’t think zero emissions by 2030 wasn’t possible (note that Sanders’ plan actually calls for 71 percent cut in domestic emissions by that date). 57 scientists from universities and research institutes responded to Biden’s comments in an open letter in support of Sanders released Tuesday.

“The top scientific body on climate change, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), tells us we must act immediately to bring the world together to stop the catastrophic impacts of climate change,” the scientists wrote. “The Green New Deal you are proposing is not only possible, but it must be done if we want to save the planet for ourselves, our children, grandchildren, and future generations.”

“Not only does your Green New Deal follow the IPCC’s timeline for action, but the solutions you are proposing to solve our climate crisis are realistic, necessary, and backed by science,” they added. “We must protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the planet we call home.”

Several of the signatories told Earther that Sanders’ plan recognizes that the U.S. is running out of time to cut emissions and adapt to a changing climate, which will require a massive amount of resources. They also emphasized that continuing to operate in a business-as-usual fashion (which could put the Earth on path to a 3 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperatures or more by the year 2100, far more than the Paris Agreement targets ) would have dire consequences.

Daniel M. Kammen, a University of California, Berkeley energy professor and director of its Renewable and Appropriate Energy Lab, told Earther via email that the “climate crisis is truly an emergency, and we need leadership that both understands that, and has a plan that will mobilize the resources necessary to make an immediate about-face in U.S. energy and environmental policy, both domestically and overseas. The Sanders Green New Deal does that.”

Citing falling prices of renewable electricity and UC Berkeley research that shows clean energy generates more jobs than dirty sources like coal and natural gas, Kammen wrote that a “massive investment in clean energy for the U.S. is a jobs and business stimulation package for U.S. exports.” It also “recognizes the environmental racism and discrimination built into our current energy system,” Kammen added. “This is why I also greatly like and respect [billionaire environmentalist candidate Tom Steyer’s] energy and climate justice plan.”

Peter Kalmus, a climate researcher and data scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, concurred in an email to Earther.

“Climate scientists have been sounding the alarm for decades and we’ve been completely ignored, thanks to lies and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry and flagrant denial from those in high office,” Kalmus wrote. “Bernie Sanders hears us. He understands that this is truly a planetary emergency and that there’s no time left for incremental measures. Bernie is the climate candidate. His movement and the climate movement are nearly one and the same.”



“It has felt awful sounding this alarm, knowing what it means for my kids and for every other being on this planet, and being completely ignored,” Kalmus added.

William Fleming, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Ian L. McHarg Center for Urbanism and Ecology and senior fellow with Data for Progress, told Earther via email that “Any appropriate response to the climate crisis will go far beyond familiar tropes of building high-speed rail and, at some distant point in the future, decarbonizing the grid. It will require fundamentally reimagining how and where we live—how we tackle issues of housing justice, transportation justice, climate and environmental justice, and building a massive, continental-scale clean energy grid in a nation of fraught land use and development politics through a cohesive set of programs and policies.”

“The Green New Deal put forward by Senator Sanders is the only plan in the field that even attempts to take on these challenges at any real scale,” Fleming added.

This isn’t the only hit Biden has taken on the environmental front lately. On Tuesday, Biden responded to a voter who said the U.S. needs to stop building new oil pipelines with “Go vote for someone else” and testily adding, “Do you believe that Bernie can do something by 2030?” The man responded, “I’m actually supporting Tom Steyer.”"

Physicists: 90% Chance of Human Society Collapsing Within Decades,https://www.ecowatch.com/human-society-collapse-deforestation-2646869167.html?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2,"Deforestation coupled with the rampant destruction of natural resources will soon have devastating effects on the future of society as we know it, according to two theoretical physicists who study complex systems and have concluded that greed has put us on a path to irreversible collapse within the next two to four decades, as VICE reported.



The research by the two physicists, one from Chile and the other from the UK, was published last week in Nature Scientific Reports. The researchers used advance statistical modeling to look at how a growing human population can cope with the loss of resources, mainly due to deforestation. After crunching the numbers, the scientists came up with a fairly bleak assessment of society's chance of surviving the climate crisis. ""Based on the current resource consumption rates and best estimate of technological rate growth our study shows that we have very low probability, less than 10 percent in most optimistic estimate, to survive without facing a catastrophic collapse,"" the authors write in the study abstract.

From all the issues that the climate crisis raises like rising sea levels, increases in extreme weather, drought, flooding, and crop failures, scientists zeroed in on deforestation since it is more measurable right now. They argue that forest density, or its current scarcity, is considered the cataclysmic canary in the coal mine, according to the report, as The New York Post reported. ""Many factors due to human activity are considered as possibly responsible for the observed changes: among these water and air contamination (mostly greenhouse effect) and deforestation are the most cited. While the extent of human contribution to the greenhouse effect and temperature changes is still a matter of discussion, the deforestation is an undeniable fact,"" the authors write.

The authors note that the current rate of deforestation would mean that all forests would disappear within 100-200 years. ""Clearly it is unrealistic to imagine that the human society would start to be affected by the deforestation only when the last tree would be cut down,"" the authors write, as the Daily Mail reported. The trajectory of such rapid resource use to supply a rapidly growing human population would result in the loss of planetary life-support systems necessary for human survival, including carbon storage, oxygen production, soil conservation and water cycle regulation, according to the Daily Mail. In the absence of these critical services, ""it is highly unlikely to imagine the survival of many species, including ours, on Earth without [forests]"" the study points out. ""The progressive degradation of the environment due to deforestation would heavily affect human society and consequently the human collapse would start much earlier,"" they write, as VICE reported.

The numbers the researchers look at highlight the extent of human greed. Prior to human civilizations, the earth was covered by 60 million square kilometers of forest. As deforestation has ramped up, the new paper points out that there are now less than 40 million square kilometers of forest remaining. ""Calculations show that, maintaining the actual rate of population growth and resource consumption, in particular forest consumption, we have a few decades left before an irreversible collapse of our civilization,"" the paper concludes, as VICE reported."
‘Like an Experimental Concentration Camp’: Whistleblower Complaint Alleges Mass Hysterectomies at ICE Detention Center,https://www.lawandcrime.com/high-profile/like-an-experimental-concentration-camp-whistleblower-complaint-alleges-mass-hysterectomies-at-ice-detention-center/amp/,"‘Like an Experimental Concentration Camp’: Whistleblower Complaint Alleges Mass Hysterectomies at ICE Detention Center

UPDATE, 12:11 p.m., Friday, Sept. 18: The Associated Press reported that more migrant women had come forward and alleged that they did not agree to surgical procedures, but AP also said that its review of the matter “did not find evidence of mass hysterectomies as alleged in a widely shared complaint filed by a nurse at the detention center.”

Per the AP [emphases ours]:

But a lawyer who helped file the complaint said she never spoke to any women who had hysterectomies. Priyanka Bhatt, staff attorney at the advocacy group Project South, told The Washington Post that she included the hysterectomy allegations because she wanted to trigger an investigation to determine if they were true.“I have a responsibility to listen to the women I’ve spoken with,” Bhatt told the AP Friday. She said one woman alleged that she was repeatedly pressured to have a hysterectomy and that authorities said they would not pay for her to get a second opinion.

Members of Congress and groups representing Dawn Wooten have demanded an investigation of the nurse’s claims about “mass hysterectomies” on Irwin County Detention Center detainees. The doctor, since identified as OB/GYN Mahendra Amin, told The Intercept he only performed “one or two hysterectomies in the past two [or] three years.”

He also denied performing surgeries without patients’ consent.

“Everything is wrong, and if you want to talk, talk to the hospital administrator,” Amin said.

Scott Grubman, a lawyer for Amin, has also “vigorously” denied the allegations in the complaint.

“We look forward to all of the facts coming out and are confident that, once they do, Dr. Amin will be cleared of wrongdoing,” Grubman said.

Amin and other doctors previously reached a settlement with the Department of Justice in 2015 after Connie Brogdon and Summer Holland filed a lawsuit “under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act and the Georgia False Medicaid Claims Act,” alleging the doctors “caused false claims to be submitted to Medicare and Medicaid.”

Project South’s Legal & Advocacy Director Azadeh Shahshahani, who also represents Wooten, called for ICDC to be “shut down immediately” on Thursday.

Acting ICE Director Tony Pham said in a statement obtained by Law&Crime on Friday that Wooten has raised “very serious concerns” that “deserve to be investigated quickly and thoroughly.”

“ICE welcomes the efforts of both the Office of Inspector General as well as the Department of Homeland Security’s parallel review. As a former prosecutor, individuals found to have violated our policies and procedures should be held accountable,” Pham said. “If there is any truth to these allegations, it is my commitment to make the corrections necessary to ensure we continue to prioritize the health, welfare and safety of ICE detainees.”

UPDATE, 6:50 p.m., Sept. 15: Medical Director of the ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) Dr. Ada Rivera said in a statement obtained by Law&Crime that ICE “vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures.”

“ICE’s mission is to protect the homeland and to swiftly and quickly remove people from the country; the health, welfare and safety of ICE detainees is one of the agency’s highest priorities, any assertion or claim to the contrary is false and intentionally misleading,” the statement said.

Rivera, citing ICE data, said that since 2018 “only two individuals at Irwin County Detention Center were referred to certified, credentialed medical professionals at gynecological and obstetrical health care facilities for hysterectomies in compliance with National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) standards.”

Rivera said detainees at ICE facilities are “afforded informed consent, and a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would never be performed against a detainee’s will.” The statement also said medical care decisions are made by medical personal, not law enforcement.

The statement further said that it was “unfortunate” that the allegations contained in the whistleblower complaint were shared with the media “without allowing the government to examine or take appropriate action.”

ICE protocols dictate a seven-step approval process for medical procedures: an evaluation for an apparent medical concern; referral to an off-site specialist (OB/GYN, for the procedures described in the complaint); recommendation for surgical procedure, if needed; a MedPAR request; review and approval of the Regional Clinical Director, except in cases of surgery to fix severely broken bones; confirmation of global surgical procedure (GSP) codes and subsequent MedPAR approval; a surgical procedure pending consent of the detainee.

UPDATE, 7:59 p.m.: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has responded to this story with a statement that said, generally speaking, “anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics” should be treated with skepticism. The agency said it takes “all allegations seriously” and defers to the DHS Office of Inspector General.

The full statement:

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does not comment on matters presented to the Office of the Inspector General, which provides independent oversight and accountability within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ICE takes all allegations seriously and defers to the OIG regarding any potential investigation and/or results. That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.

The agency maintains that the Irwin County Detention Center has been inspected multiple times, with and without warning, and that the facility has been found to be in compliance with Performance Based National Detention Standards.

Original story below.

—

Several legal advocacy groups on Monday filed a whistleblower complaint on behalf of a nurse at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center documenting “jarring medical neglect” within the facility, including a refusal to test detainees for the novel coronavirus and an exorbitant rate of hysterectomies being performed on immigrant women.

The nurse, Dawn Wooten, was employed at the Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) in Georgia, which is operated by LaSalle Corrections, a private prison company. The complaint was filed with the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) by advocacy groups Project South, Georgia Detention Watch, Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, and South Georgia Immigrant Support Network.

Multiple women came forward to tell Project South about what they perceived to be the inordinate rate at which women in ICDC were subjected to hysterectomies – a surgical operation in which all or part of the uterus is removed. Additionally, many of the immigrant women who underwent the procedure were reportedly “confused” when asked to explain why they had the surgery, with one detainee likening their treatment to prisoners in concentration camps.

“Recently, a detained immigrant told Project South that she talked to five different women detained at ICDC between October and December 2019 who had a hysterectomy done,” the complaint stated. “When she talked to them about the surgery, the women ‘reacted confused when explaining why they had one done.’ The woman told Project South that it was as though the women were ‘trying to tell themselves it’s going to be OK.’”

“When I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp. It was like they’re experimenting with our bodies,” the detainee said.

According to Wooten, ICDC consistently used a particular gynecologist – outside the facility – who almost always opted to remove all or part of the uterus of his female detainee patients.

“Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy—just about everybody,” Wooten said, adding that, “everybody’s uterus cannot be that bad.”

“We’ve questioned among ourselves like goodness he’s taking everybody’s stuff out…That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector. I know that’s ugly…is he collecting these things or something…Everybody he sees, he’s taking all their uteruses out or he’s taken their tubes out. What in the world.”

Wooten – who is being represented in the matter by the Government Accountability Project – also confirmed that many of the detained women told her that they didn’t understand why they were being forced to have the procedure. She explained that some of the nurses who didn’t speak Spanish obtained consent from detainees “by simply googling Spanish.”

The complaint details several accounts from detainees, including one woman who was not properly anesthetized during the procedure and heard the aforementioned doctor tell the nurse he had mistakenly removed the wrong ovary, resulting in her losing all reproductive ability. Another said she was scheduled for the procedure but when she questioned why it was necessary, she was given at least three completely different answers.

“She was originally told by the doctor that she had an ovarian cyst and was going to have a small twenty-minute procedure done drilling three small holes in her stomach to drain the cyst,” according to the complaint. “The officer who was transporting her to the hospital told her that she was receiving a hysterectomy to have her womb removed. When the hospital refused to operate on her because her COVID-19 test came back positive for antibodies, she was transferred back to ICDC where the ICDC nurse said that the procedure she was going to have done entailed dilating her vagina and scraping tissue off. “

Another nurse then told her the procedure was to mitigate her heavy menstrual bleeding, which the woman had never experienced. When she explained that, the nurse “responded by getting angry and agitated and began yelling at her.”

According to The Intercept, ICE declined to comment on the allegations in the complaint, while a LaSalle Corrections spox said it was “firmly committed to the health and welfare of those in our care.”

“We are deeply committed to delivering high-quality, culturally responsive services in safe and humane environments,” the person said.

Law&Crime reached out to ICE for comment. Law&Crime also reached out to DHS OIG to ask whether it has received the complaint and whether it will investigate the allegations in it. We will update this story if we receive responses.

"""We may be left with just chain restaurants and fast-food restaurants if the government doesn’t react.”",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/these-restaurants-have-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-many-more-are-at-risk-110046021.html,"This article has been updated.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to seriously fry some well-known restaurant chains.

Buckling under the stress of years of mismanagement and now the COVID-19 pandemic, Ruby Tuesday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company will look to reduce debt and re-emerge from bankruptcy. It operates some 500 company-owned and franchised restaurants.

“This announcement does not mean ‘Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday’ but ‘Hello, to a stronger Ruby Tuesday’. We very much appreciate your continued support and love for Ruby Tuesday since 1972. We enjoy serving you every day and look forward to seeing you soon,” wrote Ruby Tuesday CEO Shawn Lederman in a letter to employees and customers.

To be sure, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to seriously fry some other well-known restaurant chains.

Sizzler — an ‘80s restaurant icon known for its affordable all-you-can-eat buffets — filed for bankruptcy in late September, blaming closed restaurants due to the pandemic. The company said its 90-franchised restaurants will not be impacted by the bankruptcy. Some 14 company-operated locations are slated to stay open.

Sizzler has most of its locations concentrated in California and the upper Northwest.

California Pizza Kitchen filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late July. The mostly sit-down pizza outfit with some 200 locations has been crippled by the pandemic, noting in its bankruptcy filing sales were down about 40% year-over-year in the last week of June.

The company plans to cut $230 million in debt via its trip through the courts.

There have now been eleven bankruptcies of outright restaurant chains or operators of franchises since early April (graphic below). With each month that has passed, the filings have become prominent as restaurants struggle with weak traffic after being allowed to reopen by states, piles of debt and sky-high rent.

Besides California Pizza Kitchen, the other two high-profile names include children’s fun house Chuck E. Cheese and Wendy’s and Pizza Hut franchisee NPC International. Meanwhile, Dave & Busters — which is a part restaurant, part arcade concept — warned in September it may be forced to file for bankruptcy amid pressures from the pandemic.

Restaurant chain bankruptcies 2020

As for Dave & Busters rival, Chuck E. Cheese operates 555 locations in the U.S. that hang in the balance as it looks to restructure in courts. NPC International maintains a portfolio of 1,600 locations that also have a questionable post bankruptcy future.

Credit rating agency Fitch has warned more bankruptcies in the restaurant space wait in the wings.

“Less frequent visits due to shifts in dining to delivery service or to increasingly popular healthier quick-service options will put more pressure on traffic at some brands at the same time the restaurants face increased competition from ready-to-cook meals available in supermarkets or via home delivery,' said Fitch director Lyle Margolis in a recent report.

Fitch warned that Checkers Drive-In Restaurants and Steak ‘n Shake Operations are at risk of default. The Wall Street Journal reported in late June that Checker’s had hired restructuring advisors to explore a potential restructuring.

Ultimately, in life after COVID-19 the local restaurant scene may be no more than a KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King and one or two overpriced craft cocktail bars serving tapas which somehow managed to survive the financial distress from the pandemic.

“We have to have a bailout [of the restaurant industry],” said celebrity chef and owner of restaurant Blue Dragon Ming Tsai on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. “I don’t know if the government understands the severity of this problem. We may be left with just chain restaurants and fast-food restaurants if the government doesn’t react.”

Can’t fathom that there will be no #stimulus until after the election. On behalf of millions of restaurant employees - still without work - and hundreds of thousands of independent restaurants striving to provide jobs and return vitality to their communities, please reconsider! — Danny Meyer (@dhmeyer) October 6, 2020

Tsai thinks when it’s all said and done with the pandemic, some 50% of the country’s 1 million restaurants may no longer be open. His estimate is in line with others Yahoo Finance has talked with in recent months. All experts agree that fresh dine-in restrictions by states on fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections would be the final straw for small- to mid-size restaurants and even franchisees of well-known chains.

“You don’t know how long it lasts, the predictions are going to be unreliable for the next couple of quarters,” said long-time Denny’s CEO John Miller on the industry upheaval. “There are PPP loans, Main Street lending, a number of programs to help people get through the difficult time. As long as it recovers as fast as the virus is arrested one way or another, then we believe certainly within a year to a year and a half, things could be in pretty good shape and not as damaging as people might believe at the moment. There will be some shakeout.”

Joe Biden says to 'Vote for Someone Else' if you'd like to ban fracking,https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/12/05/people-who-want-ban-fracking-immediately-says-joe-biden-oughta-vote-someone-else,"If you want a candidate committed to banning fracking in the United States immediately, find another candidate than Joe Biden.

That's the advice of Biden himself, given to an activist from the Sunrise Movement in a video posted online Thursday after the two discussed the former vice president's adviser Heather Zichal and Biden's plans for the future of fracking.

Here's a thought, @JoeBiden. Maybe your climate policy advisor shouldn't be somebody who has taken a million dollars from the fossil fuel industry



Otherwise your commitment to averting the climate crisis sounds like a bunch of...well, malarkey. pic.twitter.com/JnfRvOer45 — Sunrise Movement (@sunrisemvmt) December 5, 2019

In the video of the interaction posted on Twitter by Sunrise Thursday afternoon, Biden appears confused about Zichal's connections to the natural gas industry, protesting that the adviser ""worked for us in the administration.""

""No, no, I know,"" the Sunrise activist patiently explains as Biden grabs him by the shoulders. ""But she also worked—""

""If you look at my record,"" Biden begins, ""look at my record. Just look at my record.""

The two discuss fracking as well. Biden tells the activist that ""you can't ban fracking right now"" because ""you gotta transition away from it.""

""You're gonna ban fracking all across America, right now, right?"" Biden asks the Sunrise activist.

""I would love to,"" the activist replies.

""I'd love to, too,"" says Biden. ""I'd love to make sure we can't use any oil or gas, period. Now, now, is it possible?""

""Yes,"" replies the Sunrise activist.

""Well, you oughta vote for someone else,"" says Biden, releasing the young man and moving on.

As Sludge reported in May, adviser Zichal ""recently occupied a lucrative seat on the board of the Texas-based liquified natural gas (LNG) company Cheniere Energy."" Cheniere is a frequent donor to Republican politicians.

CounterPunch editor Jeffrey St. Clair referred to Biden's ""No Malarkey"" bus tour in a tweet about the interaction.

""Here's some choice malarkey from Biden on his climate advisor, Heather Zichal, who pulled down more than a cool (or hot, I guess) million on the board of Cheniere Energy, a Texas-based liquified natural gas company whose execs she'd gotten cozy with while working for Obama,"" tweeted St. Clair.

The interaction caught the attention of Briahna Joy Gray, campaign press secretary for Bernie Sanders, who earlier this year added a federal fracking ban to his 2020 campaign platform.

""Biden says 'you ought to vote for somebody else' if you want us to ban fracking and transition away from fossil fuels now,"" tweeted Gray. ""Might I recommend Bernie Sanders: the climate candidate."""
Arizona and Texas are requesting refrigerated trucks as morgues are running out of space,https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-texas-request-refrigerated-trucks-coronavirus-dead-2020-7,"Hospital and county officials in Texas and Arizona are requesting refrigerated trucks as the states grapple with a new wave of coronavirus cases and deaths.

The refrigerated trucks would serve as makeshift morgues to hold dead bodies.

As of Sunday, hospitals in Arizona were at about 90% capacity. Texas is dealing with more than 124,000 active cases.

Refrigerated trucks are being sent to Texas and Arizona in anticipation of a spike in coronavirus deaths in the two southern states.

They are among several states seeing a new wave of coronavirus cases at the moment.

As of Sunday, Arizona's hospitals were at 90% capacity. Meanwhile, Texas is dealing with more than 124,000 new cases across the state, according to state data.

While deaths haven't climaxed yet, they usually follow a few weeks after cases begin to rise, so a new wave of deaths is almost certainly on the way.

In anticipation of this, counties and hospitals in both states have started requesting refrigerated trucks to hold the dead in, with morgues likely to run out of space.

Abrazo Helath, a hospital in Phoenix, says it currently has enough morgue space, but is requesting the refrigerated trucks so it can be ready.

""The state has requested that hospitals implement their emergency plans,"" an Abrazo spokesperson told Fox 10. ""Part of activating our plan includes the ability to handle overflow morgue capacity if needed.""

""Abrazo has taken a proactive approach by ordering refrigerated storage in the event it may be needed during a surge of COVID patients. At this point it is not needed.""

The Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office in Arizona has also put in a request for makeshift morgue trucks. Maricopa County is the center of the outbreak in the state at the moment.

""Our planners at Unified Command are moving toward acquiring coolers and staffing because Office of the Medical Examiner is currently near capacity for body storage. This is a situation that occurs almost every summer and is further complicated by the current pandemic,"" the office said in a statement.

It's a similar story in Texas, where several counties have requested refrigerated trucks.

The morgue in Nueces County, home to Corpus Christi, is already at capacity.

The county's medical examiner, Dr. Adel Shaker, told The Texas Tribune that they actually got an extra morgue trailer at the beginning of the outbreak, but sent it to another city because they had so few cases.

But now they need the space.

Mayor Ron Nirenberg of San Antonio said Monday that refrigerated trucks are on the standby to help as morgues run out of space for bodies.

Dr. Ken Davis, the chief medical officer for CHRISTUS Health South Texas, told KSAT that the refrigerated trucks will help hold bodies at the hospital until the morgue or the funeral home can pick them up.

""It's a hard thing to talk about,"" Davis said. ""People's loved ones are dying. In the hospital, there are only so many places to put bodies of the loved ones and we're out of space. Our funeral homes are out of space."""

In Greener Than You Think, a 1947 novel by the left-wing sci-fi writer Ward Moore, a mad woman scientist in Los Angeles recruits a down-and-out salesman named Albert Weener, described as having “all the earmarks of a castiron moocher,” to help promote her discovery: a compound called Metamorphizer that enhances the growth of grasses and allows them to thrive on barren and rocky soils. The scientist dreams of permanently ending world hunger through a massive expansion of the range of wheat and other grains; Weener, a scientific ignoramus, thinks only of making a quick buck peddling the stuff door-to-door as a lawn treatment. Desperately needing cash to continue her research, she reluctantly agrees, and Weener heads out to the yellowed lawns of tired bungalow neighborhoods.1 Ad Policy

To his surprise, the treatment, which alters grass genes, works—only too well. In the yard of the Dinkman family, crabgrass is converted into a nightmare “Devil Grass,” resistant to mowing and weed killers, that begins to spread across the city. “It writhed and twisted in nightmarish unease…inexorably enveloping everything in its path. A crack in the roadway disappeared under it, a shrub was swallowed up, a patch of wall vanished.” It continues to eat pavement and houses and finally consumes the city: a monstrous new nature creeping toward Bethlehem.2

Greener Than You Think is both hilarious and slightly unnerving. But its absurd premise is being turned into current events by climate change. Our Devil Grass is Bromus, a genus of invasive and almost ineradicable grasses bearing appropriately unsavory names like ripgut brome, cheatgrass, and false brome. Originating in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, some species have been around California since the Gold Rush, when overgrazing allowed the bromes and European oat grass to aggressively replace native species. But now fire and exurban sprawl have become their Metamorphizers as they conquer virtually every ecosystem in the state.3

The Eastern Mojave Desert is a grim example. If you drive from LA to Vegas, 20 minutes from the state line, there’s an exit from Interstate 15 to a two-lane blacktop called Cima Road. It’s the unassuming portal to one of North America’s most magical forests: countless miles of old-growth Joshua trees mantling a field of small Pleistocene volcanoes known as the Cima Dome. The monarchs of this forest are 30 feet high and centuries old. In mid-August an estimated 1.3 million of these astonishing giant yuccas perished in the lightning-ignited Dome Fire. This wasn’t the first time the Eastern Mojave burned. A megafire in 2005 scorched a million acres of desert, but it spared the Dome, the heart of the forest. Over the last generation, an invasion of red brome has created a flammable understory to the Joshuas and transformed the Mojave into a fire ecology. (Invasive cheatgrass and wire grass have played similar roles in the Great Basin and the Pacific Northwest.)4

Most desert plants, unlike California oaks and chaparral, are not fire-adapted, so their recovery may be impossible. Debra Hughson, the chief of science at the Mojave National Preserve, described the fire as an extinction event in an interview with the Desert Sun. “The Joshua trees are very flammable. They’ll die, and they won’t come back.”5

Our burning deserts are regional expressions of a global trend: the fire-driven transformation and replacement of native land cover from Greenland to Hawaii. Even the Antarctic Peninsula now has an invasive weed problem. In most cases, exotic plants—especially annual grasses and forbs (herblike plants)—are the culprits. In southeastern US forests the devil is cogongrass from East Asia; in Australia, buffel grass from India; and in Hawaii, guinea grass from Africa.6

Bromes, superbly adapted to the Anthropocene, rule the West Coast. As Travis Bean, a weed scientist at the University of California, Riverside, warned last year, “We have all of the nasty nonnative Bromus species here in California, and these weeds are key drivers of increasing fire frequency.” Increased fire frequency, in turn, opens spaces for the propagation of these fast-growing and easily dispersed species. Whereas recovering mountain chaparral, for instance, requires 20 years to mature before it can burn, bromes need only one or two winters’ rain to produce enough flammable biomass to sustain a large fire. Once established, the ensuing invasive-grass and fire cycle is almost irreversible.7 Current Issue View our current issue

This is especially true in Mediterranean biomes, despite the fact that their vegetation has evolved with fire and requires episodic burns to reproduce. The current wave of annual extreme fires in the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, Australia, and California is overriding Holocene adaptations and pushing native ecosystems, many of them already degraded, past their survival tipping points.8

Although Australia is a close contender, California best illustrates the vicious circle in which extreme heat leads to frequent extreme fires that prevent natural regeneration—and with the help of tree diseases, accelerate the conversion of iconic landscapes into parched grasslands and treeless mountain slopes. And with the loss of native plants goes much of the native fauna, from lizards to songbirds.9

Climate change drives landscape conversion in several ways. At the beginning of this century, state water planners and fire authorities were primarily focused on the threat of multiyear droughts caused by intensified La Niña episodes and stubbornly persistent high-pressure domes. Their worst fears were realized in the great drought of the last decade, perhaps the worst in 500 years, which contributed to the death of an estimated 150 million bark-beetle-infested trees that subsequently provided fuel for the firestorms of 2017 and 2018.10

Similarly, over the past 20 years, an exponentially spreading fungal pandemic called sudden oak death has killed millions of live oaks and tan oaks from Big Sur to southwestern Oregon. Climate change, which increases heat and drought, facilitates this disease and drives its spread. Since the tan oaks, especially, grow in forests with Douglas firs, redwoods, and ponderosa pines, their dead hulks act as force multipliers in the firestorms raging in coastal mountains and the Sierra foothills.11

In addition to ordinary droughts, scientists now talk about a new phenomenon, the hot drought. Even in years with average 20th century rainfall, extreme summer heat—our new normal—is producing massive water deficits through evaporation from reservoirs, streams, and rivers. In the case of Southern California’s lifeline, the lower Colorado River, a staggering 20 percent decrease in the current flow has been predicted within a few decades, independent of whether precipitation declines.12

But the most devastating impact of the Death Valley–like temperatures (it was 121 degrees in the San Fernando Valley in early September) is the loss of plant and soil moisture. A wet winter and early spring may mesmerize us with extravagant displays of wildflowers, but they also produce bumper crops of grasses and forbs that are then baked in our furnace summers to become fuel when the devil winds return.13

The bromes and other pyromaniacal weeds like black mustard are the chief by-products and facilitators of this new fire regime. Years of research at experimental plots, where scientists burn different types of vegetation and study their fire behavior, has confirmed their Darwinian edge. They burn at twice the temperature of herbaceous ground cover, vaporizing soil nutrients essential to the regeneration of native species. Bromes also thrive on air pollution (a nitrogen fertilizer), can quickly evolve resistance to herbicides, and are more efficient than most plants in utilizing higher levels of carbon dioxide—big evolutionary advantages in the current struggle between ecosystems.14

Until recently, it was widely believed that the West Coast’s closed-canopy forests were largely invulnerable to the brome threat because they are too cool and shaded. But now a group of researchers from Oregon State University’s College of Forestry and the US Forest Service that is studying the question warns forest managers that false brome adapts well to the forest gloom, and cheatgrass immediately colonizes forest burn sites. Once a durable feedback loop with fire is established, a forest grass invasion becomes, in the researchers’ words, a “perfect storm.”15

And like Moore’s Devil Grass, the invaders defy human will. “Management actions such as thinning and prescribed fire, often designed to alleviate threats related to wildfires, may also exacerbate grass invasion and increase fine fuels, with potential landscape scale consequences that are largely underrecognized,” the group reported. In other words, some of the textbook prescriptions for reducing fire hazards may only reproduce them in a new form—something that is poorly understood by public officials.16

This is the Achilles’ heel of the emergency legislation that California Senator Dianne Feinstein, with the support of the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, is trying to push through Congress. The bill would override federal environmental regulations to accelerate the removal of dead trees and the clearance of chaparral and brush—yet the cleared landscapes would be inviting to bromes, which have the ability to generate huge fuel loads annually. (Also the deadwood would presumably be burned, contrary to carbon reduction mandates.)17

Only a sustained annual effort to reduce grass biomass reseeding—something that would require a large army of full-time forest workers and the cooperation of landowners—could, theoretically, postpone the weed apocalypse. It would also require a moratorium on new construction as well as on postfire rebuilding in the most hazardous areas, measures that are hardly palatable in the state capital, Sacramento, even in the era of a Democratic supermajority.18

After every fire emergency, Newsom and other liberals call for urgent action to reduce emissions. But in doing so, they deliberately elide the question of what needs to be done on the ground, here and now. Such an agenda would have to directly confront the sprawl along what fire experts label the wildland-urban interface.19

A large share of new housing in California over the past 20 years has been built, profitably but insanely, in high-fire-risk areas like the Sierra foothills. By one estimate, a quarter of the state’s population now lives in these interface areas—with scores of new developments and master-planned communities in the pipeline. (In San Diego County alone, supervisors recently approved 10,000 new homes in extreme-fire-hazard locations in the backcountry.) Since 40 percent of the state’s 33 million acres of forest are privately owned (57 percent is federal land, and only 3 percent under state or local control), there are few constraints on future development.20

The expansion of the residential frontier into disaster-prone landscapes isn’t just a California trend; think of the building boom on Atlantic and Gulf Coast barrier islands that become submerged in hurricane storm surges. According to geographers Laura Taylor and Patrick Hurley, “Despite the common perception that the United States has become a ‘suburban nation,’ exurbia has emerged as the dominant settlement pattern across the country, characterized by different patterns of development and different lifestyle expectations from cities, towns, and suburbs, with houses in scenic, natural areas on relatively large acreages (often with one house per 10, 20, or 40 acres or more).”21

But there are two very different kinds of migrants to the exurbs. Some, like the inhabitants of Paradise, the Sierra foothill city incinerated in 2018, are rent refugees from the state’s housing crisis or ordinary folks, especially retirees, who want to own a tiny piece of California’s beauty. But they are minor players compared with the influx of wealth from the coast. Rural areas that were once ruggedly blue-collar and derided as “Appalachia” (an insult long attached to eastern San Diego County, where I grew up) now boast starter castles, high-end subdivisions, and spa retreats. From Mendocino on the north coast to the San Diego mountains in the south, upper 5 percent migration has been gentrifying the urban hinterlands, especially those areas with high-value amenities like ocean views, wineries, and forest lakes.22

An equally prized amenity is their racial homogeneity. “Exurbanization” is often a euphemism for white flight from metropolitan diversity. As California’s suburbs turn Technicolor and become more Democratic, the exurbs (with some exceptions) are hard-core Donald Trump country and are fiercely anti-government—except in fire season. One of their leading voices was Duncan Hunter Jr., now on his way from Congress to prison, who represented the exurban corridor along I-15 from San Diego to Riverside. For years he fought restrictions on backcountry development with the same zeal that he opposed Latino immigrants and unions.23

This is a mindset, blind to the consequences, that allies itself with the botanical counterrevolution. Relentless land clearance and home construction fragment habitats, introduce myriad fire ignition sources, and promote weed invasion. Yet the newcomers are unwilling to pay taxes for increased fire protection—and raise hell when foresters attempt prescribed burns. Meanwhile, shorthanded fire crews are under tremendous pressure to defend individual homesites, which has led to increased deaths and injuries.24

Exurbanites seem incapable of learning the obvious lessons from recent megafires. In 2003 a firestorm destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the unincorporated towns of Alpine and Crest in the mountains east of San Diego. When I took a film crew there last year, the lost homes had been replaced by even larger ones, and residents assured us that thanks to brush clearance, the fire hazard had been mitigated. But the quest for defensible space, zealously marketed by developers and local officials, is a dangerous mirage. Firestorms that create their own tornadic weather systems and can hurl fiery debris a kilometer ahead of the flame front are not deterred by a 300-foot circumference of brush clearance or a few carefully watered beds of ice plant.25

How should we understand the large-scale ecological consequences of the invasive-grass and wildfire cycle? One perhaps surprising analogue is the aftermath of the firebombing of Germany during World War II. In the late 1940s the ruins of Berlin became a laboratory where natural scientists studied plant succession. The expectation was that the original vegetation of the region—oak woodlands and their shrubs—would soon reestablish itself. To the scientists’ horror, this was not the case. Instead escaped exotics, some of them rare garden plants, established themselves as the new dominants.26

The botanists continued their studies until the last bomb sites were cleared in the 1980s. The persistence of this dead-zone vegetation and the failure of the plants of the Pomeranian woodlands to reestablish themselves prompted a debate about Nature II. The contention was that the extreme heat from firebombing and the pulverization of brick structures had created a soil type that invited colonization by rugged plants such as tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) that had evolved on the moraines of Pleistocene ice sheets. An all-out nuclear war, they warned, might reproduce these conditions on a vast scale.27

Fire in the Anthropocene has become the physical equivalent of nuclear war. In the aftermath of Victoria’s Black Saturday fires in early 2009, Australian scientists calculated that their released energy equaled 1,500 Hiroshima-size explosions. Even greater energy has produced the pyrocumulus plumes that for weeks have towered over Northern California and Oregon. Likewise the toxic orange fog that shrouded the Bay Area for weeks might be considered a miniature nuclear winter.28

As a result, a new, profoundly sinister nature is rapidly emerging from our fire rubble at the expense of landscapes we once considered sacred. Our imaginations can barely encompass the speed or scale of the catastrophe.29"
New study shows that poor countries do more to develop rich countries than the other way around,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800920300938,"Ecologically unequal exchange theory posits asymmetric net flows of biophysical resources from poorer to richer countries. To date, empirical evidence to support this theoretical notion as a systemic aspect of the global economy is largely lacking. Through environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output modelling, we provide empirical evidence for ecologically unequal exchange as a persistent feature of the global economy from 1990 to 2015. We identify the regions of origin and final consumption for four resource groups: materials, energy, land, and labor. By comparing the monetary exchange value of resources embodied in trade, we find significant international disparities in how resource provision is compensated. Value added per ton of raw material embodied in exports is 11 times higher in high-income countries than in those with the lowest income, and 28 times higher per unit of embodied labor. With the exception of embodied land for China and India, all other world regions serve as net exporters of all types of embodied resources to high-income countries across the 1990–2015 time period. On aggregate, ecologically unequal exchange allows high-income countries to simultaneously appropriate resources and to generate a monetary surplus through international trade. This has far-reaching implications for global sustainability and for the economic growth prospects of nations."
We’ve got to start thinking beyond our own lifespans if we’re going to avoid extinction,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/16/weve-got-to-start-thinking-beyond-our-own-lifespans-if-were-going-to-avoid-extinction,"In a biology lesson about the bacterial growth curve, the parallels with the climate crisis were hard to miss. Stick bacteria in a test tube with food and their population will grow exponentially until, eventually, they run out of resources and kill themselves off. Even a couple of decades ago, the comparison with humanity’s predicament felt glaringly obvious; and we have not really strayed since from the inevitable path to extinction.

The hope seems to be that a big crisis might be the shock we need to change course. But we are living through the biggest global crisis for decades – and are travelling and consuming less as a result of the pandemic – yet it already seems unlikely that much will change. It’s easy enough to throw around the old adage “never waste a good crisis”. But when it comes to existential questions about the future of humanity, it has proved fairly useless.

Coronavirus or not, we remain locked into a treadmill that measures progress by growing GDP rather than by wellbeing and environmental sustainability. This is an economic paradigm that has served most of us – particularly the most affluent – pretty well for decades. But the richer we’ve got, the more the benefits have tailed off. There have been a number of studies showing that, beyond a certain point, more wealth does not necessarily equal more happiness – true at a societal level as well as an individual one.

There is a lot that could account for this flatlining. It was once assumed that increased productivity, driven by technological progress, would result in us having more leisure time: see John Maynard Keynes’s prediction in the 1930s that we’d be working just 15 hours a week by now. But instead, luxury beat leisure and an explosion in consumerism has driven us towards ever more consumption. The “happiness” economist Richard Layard has also pointed towards “disorders of development” such as obesity and tech addiction (although it should be noted that within a wealthy society such as ours, obesity is associated with poverty).

For a while after the 2008 crash, it looked as if things might change – economists designed global ‘happiness’ indices

The costs of this consumption have increased. Much of it is subsidised by labour exploitation, both at home and abroad. And then there is the small issue of catastrophic climate change, as we race towards “tipping points” beyond which global heating becomes self-reinforcing and harder to halt without unprecedented levels of coordinated international action.

Stack all this up, and the idea of already-rich societies moving towards a “zero growth” economic model – once the preserve of the radical green fringes of politics – starts to look increasingly like a no-brainer. We would have to sacrifice gains in material living standards, but the potential prize would be preserving the planet and achieving a better worklife balance. If we could protect the least affluent from any negative impacts – which would require more redistribution, not to mention paying more for services such as caring and cleaning – what’s not to like?

The big problem is, of course, no one knows how to get there. The 2008 financial crisis offered a chance to take stock. For a while, it looked like something might happen: economists designed global “happiness” indices and the UN General Assembly declared a “world happiness day”. But not only did nothing change: it was used as political cover for darker agendas. Bhutan adopted a measure for Gross National Happiness in an attempt to market itself globally as the “happiness” country, while papering over its record of human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing. In the UK, David Cameron pledged to set up a national wellbeing index as he cut back mental health services, youth services and children’s centres.

We’re back there again: happiness advocates saying we can’t afford to waste this opportunity to rethink, even as the government has prioritised pubs over schools – economic recovery over broader measures of wellbeing – in relaxing the lockdown.

This is no surprise. Our political and economic systems are utterly indisposed to the radical shifts we need to promote wellbeing over wealth and protect the planet. Short-termism is everywhere, from politicians who face elections every few years to company directors who must account for quarterly results. On the right, there are powerful vested interests who want to maintain business as usual – who go quiet in the wake of a crisis, or even appear to jump on the bandwagon (just look at Davos agendas in recent years), but who do all in their power to obstruct change. The left often makes peace with continuous growth, despite its costs, because a rising tide makes redistribution easier. And it is crazy to think that a shock to GDP caused by a financial crisis or a pandemic could be used as a bridge to a different world because the brunt of the pain is always, always borne by the least affluent and the young.

So we need to think far more about the mechanisms and institutions that could get us on to a different path. The Long Time Project is exploring how humans could shift their time horizons so, simply put, we feel more emotionally connected to our future descendants. It points to the fact that we tend to view our future selves, let alone future generations, as strangers. We need to rewire the way we think about the future, and our own ageing and deaths; the projects’ founders believe that art and culture can play an important role. And we could learn from those times in history when humans have proved their ability to think beyond their own lifespan: “cathedral thinking” is based on those architects who planned spectacular buildings that would never be finished in their own lifetimes.

It’s no exaggeration to say that, unless we find a way to think differently about consumption, wellbeing and sustainability, humans will be responsible for our own extinction. And it should be clear by now that crises – extreme weather, pandemics, financial crises – are never going to be the wake-up call that forces us to confront our own fragility. A good crisis inevitably goes to waste, and it is lazy and irresponsible to think otherwise.

At a Glance Climate records have fallen one by one this year.

Scientists say we can't blame the freakish weather on 2020.

And things are only going to get worse. One by one, climate and disaster records and milestones have been shattered in 2020. The stories of the extremes make daily headlines:

Nine cities see their earliest snowfall ever.

A South Dakota River was in flood stage for 17 months.

The last decade was the hottest ever recorded on Earth.

A brutal California heat wave had off-the-charts temperatures.

Historic wildfires burn across the western United States.

Things can only go up from here, right?

That's not what the experts say. Scientists and climate experts resoundingly agree that we're likely to see more years like 2020, with more intense, destructive and deadly weather events.

""These are all things we should expect to see more and more of as climate change takes a deeper hold on our climate and on the extremities that it creates in our weather,"" Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told weather.com in a recent interview.

These extremes are being driven by temperature increases brought on by global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. Things like heat, drought and fire are especially influenced by climate change.

""As temperatures increase, warm-season phenomena like drought, wildfires and heatwaves are expected to be worsened both in intensity and in longevity,"" said weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Belles. ""The increase in temperatures will dry out the ground and its flora, which will slowly lead to a positive feedback cycle of warmer temperatures, then less rainfall, then warmer temperatures and so forth.""

Many of the phenomena happening now have been predicted for years by agencies like NASA, NOAA and the United Nations, as well as researchers and scientists around the world, who say the only chance of slowing climate change is cutting back or eliminating the biggest producers of greenhouse gases, including cars.

Advertisement ""It seems like this is what we always were talking about a decade ago,"" North Carolina State climatologist Kathie Dello told the Associated Press.

""A lot of people want to blame it on 2020, but 2020 didn’t do this. We know the behaviour that caused climate change.""

Global temperatures have warmed an average of 2 degrees over the past century, according to NOAA. From 1900 to 1980, a new temperature record was typically set every 13.5 years. Since 1981, a new record's been set every three years.

""We know climate change is occurring based on palaeoclimatology records over thousands of years,"" Belles said. ""We are just beginning to understand what the effects of climate change are, but science is beginning to present higher and higher doubts on certain things happening without climate change.""

Rising sea levels driven by warmer ocean temperatures that cause water to expand, as well as increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, are projected to make disasters like flooding and hurricanes worse.

Warmer water fuels hurricanes and recent research has linked climate change to more frequent and intense storms.

""The hurricanes question is still a hot debate in the research community,"" Belles said. ""The current thought process is that warmer temperatures will lead to warmer oceans and more fuel for hurricanes, but there may also be drier air and more wind shear. The end result may be fewer or a similar amount of storms, but more intense storms when they are able to thrive.""

There are also indications that climate change is making hurricanes more likely to slow down.

""The reason for this is that hurricanes are made to move heat from the tropics to the poles in a constant effort to make the globe universally the same temperature, a dangerous balancing act,"" Belles said. ""But the poles are warming considerably faster than the tropics, meaning there is less of a difference in temperature between the poles and the tropics and less of a reason for hurricanes to move northward away from the tropics.""

He said that could lead to more flooding episodes like Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which stalled out and dumped huge amounts of rain over parts of Texas for days.

""It’s going to get a lot worse,"" Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb told the AP. ""I say that with emphasis because it does challenge the imagination. And that’s the scary thing to know as a climate scientist in 2020.""

Global death rate from rising temperatures projected to surpass the current death rate of all infectious diseases combined,http://www.impactlab.org/news-insights/global-death-rate-from-rising-temperatures/,"This summer, the world is experiencing record hot temperatures: June continued a 2020 streak, ranking among the warmest months in history. A weather station in Death Valley, California, clocked a scorching 53.3°C /128°F in July, one of the hottest temperatures ever observed on Earth. Officials from Dehli to Tokyo to Lagos, cities where past heat waves have claimed hundreds of lives, are bracing for dangerously hot periods. Simultaneously, the coronavirus pandemic’s devastating mortality impact and economic fallout are demanding society prioritize public health like never before.

How much is temperature to blame when hospital visits surge during heat waves and cold spells? What role might adaptations like indoor heating and cooling systems play in blunting those effects? And, at what cost? A new study from the Climate Impact Lab, published today by the National Bureau of Economic Research, takes on these questions and finds that in a world with continued high fossil-fuel emissions, warmer temperatures will rank among the world’s most significant public health threats by the end of the century.

Specifically, the study projects that climate change’s effect on temperatures could raise global mortality rates by 73 deaths per 100,000 people in 2100 under a continued high emissions scenario, compared to a world with no warming. That level is roughly equal to the current death rate for all infectious diseases—including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and diseases transmitted by ticks, mosquitos, and parasites—combined (approximately 74 deaths per 100,000 globally).

“Our data indicate that with the continued growth of greenhouse gas emissions, the temperature effects of climate change are projected to be five times deadlier than recent U.S. flu seasons. In poor hot countries, the heat may be even more threatening than cancer and heart disease are today,” says Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics at the University of Chicago.

In the worst-hit countries, including Ghana, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sudan, climate change could be responsible for an additional 200 or more deaths per 100,000 by the end of the century, the research shows. The study comes from the interdisciplinary Climate Impact Lab, which has developed a new approach that uses real-world data to understand the impacts of climate change. Researchers reveal the role of higher incomes in reducing heat’s health threat and the significant costs of adapting to rising temperatures, clearing a major hurdle that to-date has stymied researchers in this field. Under a scenario of continued high emissions, the researchers estimate that climate change’s impact on mortality will cost the world roughly 3.2% of global economic output in 2100.

To uncover the relationship between temperature and mortality, the team distilled 399 million death records across 41 countries, accounting for 55 percent of the global population. They summarized this complex calculation into a single value representing projected spending to adapt to rising heat, like installing air conditioning, plus the value of life-years lost. The results, which also quantify uncertainty, can be used by decision-makers to weigh the benefits of reducing emissions: emitting one additional ton of CO 2 today costs ourselves and future generations a total of $36.6 under a continued high emissions scenario and $17.1 under a moderate emissions scenario.

“This means an average American imposes about $575 worth of unpaid-for death-related harm on the world each year by emitting 15.7 tons of CO2. By comparison, the entire foreign aid budget of the US amounts to about $150 per person,” notes Robert Kopp, director of the Rutgers Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Rutgers University.

The authors emphasize that the victims of climate change in their analysis are no longer an abstract and distant generation.

“We are studying the risk of death faced by our own children. Today’s ten-year-old fifth grader will turn 65 in 2075, facing mortality risks from climate change every year of their retirement. Failing to address climate change is not that different from driving your kids around without a seat belt: you are putting their lives at risk,” says Solomon Hsiang, the Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at UC Berkeley.

Age and income are especially significant predictors of the mortality risk associated with climate change, the findings show. More frequent hot days prove deadliest for elderly populations, but those living in wealthier locations are better protected. The study also accounts for climate change’s potential to reduce the frequency of life-threatening cold days. By the end of the century, damages to society grow significantly with death rates increasing most among today’s poorest populations—exacerbating existing inequalities.

“The data show that poor communities don’t have the means to adapt, so they end up dying from warming at much higher rates,” says Tamma Carleton, an assistant professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Rich communities are likely to spend a lot of money to protect themselves, resources that they would be able to spend elsewhere if they didn’t have to spend it coping with the heat.”

By dividing the globe into 24,378 regions, the findings identify which places will bear the greatest burden. A more granular view of the findings is available at http://www.impactlab.org/map/. The Lab’s Impact Map shows estimated mortality costs for three future time periods under two emissions scenarios, country-by-country around the globe, and at the state level for the U.S.

Communities that have been exposed to hot climates for a long time are better adapted, the study shows. For example, in the wealthy and warm city of Houston, Texas, the impact of a single hot day above 35°C /95°F on the annual mortality rate is half the size of the effect of the same 35°C/95°F day in the comparably wealthy but colder city of Seattle, Washington. In the warm but poorer city of Delhi, India, the rate is also double that of Houston, largely because Delhi’s population hasn’t had the means to adapt. But Delhi fares worse than both Seattle and Houston, with many more of these hot days every year resulting in more lives lost to heat. Similarly, Accra, Ghana, faces an increase from one to 102 days per year above 32°C/90°F by the end of the century under continued high emissions, projected to increase the city’s mortality rate about 19 percent.

“Just as countries are impacted in different ways by extreme temperatures today, we find that the trend will continue and perhaps even intensify into the future as adaptation becomes more and more critical to people’s survival. Indeed, some will need to choose between paying a high cost to adapt and death,” says Amir Jina, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

A key finding is that although adaptation is expensive, it is a powerful way to reduce the mortality impacts of high temperatures. Globally, elderly populations in the richest third of locations are less vulnerable than those in the poorest third of locations, with a hot day above 35°C/95°F causing 5 fewer deaths per 100,000 in the wealthier parts of the world.

The researchers find that there are very high returns to lowering emissions. Even moderate mitigation of emissions that falls short of the Paris Agreement’s long-term targets would cut the projected mortality impacts of climate change by about 84 percent at the end of the century, relative to a scenario of continued high emissions. Under this moderate emissions scenario, projections show climate change could be responsible for 11 additional deaths per 100,000 by 2099—on par with the current fatality rate from auto accidents in the U.S. of roughly 12 deaths per 100,000.

“Fortunately, the world can still change course by aggressively reducing emissions, and in doing so has the potential to deliver some of the most significant public health gains in human history,” says Trevor Houser, a partner at the Rhodium Group."
"Sir David Attenborough to 60 Minutes on climate change: ""A crime has been committed""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sir-david-attenborough-60-minutes-2020-09-27/,"Sir David Attenborough was 28-years-old when he convinced his bosses at the BBC to let him travel the world and document his explorations. He has perpetually been on the road ever since.

For nearly 70 years, the knighted Briton and his teams of filmmakers have traveled to some of the most remote places on earth to explore the natural world.

""I want [people] to know…not the human story particularly, but the story of life on this earth, how it how it developed,"" Attenborough told 60 Minutes.

Now 94, Attenborough has witnessed the evolution of the natural world more closely than most.

Attenborough studied geology and zoology before embarking on a career in television and film. Ever since, he has been an animal advocate, conservationist, and serves as an ambassador for the World Wildlife Fund.

For much of his career, Attenborough chose not to preach conservation in his films. In 2002, the naturalist told 60 Minutes correspondent Ed Bradley in an interview that his role was to show an ""objective depiction of the natural world.""

Attenborough with Ed Bradley

""The most important job is persuading people that the natural world is complex and wonderful and one of the most precious things we have,"" Attenborough said to 60 Minutes in 2002. ""And if you're going to do that, then every time you do it, you show the facts, you end up by saying, 'And it's all disappearing and it's all your fault,' people will stop viewing.""

Until recently, Attenborough's films shied away from making sweeping declarations about the planet's changing climate.

That stance has changed.

Attenborough's latest project includes a book and film both titled, ""A Life on Our Planet."" The documentary premiers on Netflix on October 4. He calls this latest project his ""witness statement,"" and on 60 Minutes told correspondent Anderson Cooper ""a crime has been committed"" against the planet.

""We're both in broadcasting, if you're going be telling something as though it's true, you better be sure it's true,"" Attenborough said to Cooper. ""So I didn't say anything much about the world being in ecological peril until I was absolutely sure that what I was talking about was correct.""

Attenborough during the shoot for this week's 60 Minutes story

Attenborough no longer minces words nor leaves his viewers wondering where he stands on the issue of climate change. In the new film, he laments Earth's decline and states emphatically, ""Our planet is headed for disaster.""

Despite his stark warning about the planet's peril, Attenborough told Cooper it is not too late to salvage it, if countries work together and societies alter their behavior. The nonagenarian remains hopeful for the future.

""There's a huge movement around the world of people from all nations, young people who can see what is happening to the world, and demanding that their government should take action,"" Attenborough said. ""And that's the best hope that I have.""

Scientists say suppression of environment research is getting worse,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02669-8,"Scientists have been banned from publicly discussing the environmental effects of activities such as mining.Credit: Getty

Environmental scientists in Australia say that they are under increasing pressure from their employers to downplay research findings or avoid communicating them at all. More than half of the respondents to an online survey thought that constraints on speaking publicly on issues such as threatened species, urban development, mining, logging and climate change had become worse in recent years1.

The findings, published this month in Conservation Letters, reflect how politicized debates about environmental policy in Australia have become, says Saul Cunningham, an environmental scientist at the Australian National University in Canberra. “We need our publicly funded institutions to be more vocal in defending the importance of an independent voice based on research,” he says.

Australian scientists aren’t the only ones who have reported interference in science or pressure — particularly from government employers — to downplay research findings. Scientists in the United States, Canada and Brazil have also reported such intrusions in the past decade.

Scale of the problem

Two hundred and twenty scientists in Australia responded to the survey, which was organized by the Ecological Society of Australia and ran from October 2018 until February 2019. Some of the respondents worked in government; others worked in universities or in industry, such as environmental consultancies or non-governmental organizations.

The results show that government and industry scientists experienced greater constraints from their employers than did university staff. Among government employees, about half were prohibited from speaking publicly about their research, compared with 38% employed in industry and 9% of university staff. Three-quarters of those surveyed also reported self-censoring their work (see ‘Scientists silenced’).

Source: D. A. Driscoll et al. Conserv. Lett. e12757 (2020)

One-third of government respondents and 30% of industry employees also reported that their employers or managers had modified their work to downplay or mislead the public on the environmental impacts of activities such as logging and mining.

Government employers most commonly modified science reported for the media or for internal communications, but conference presentations and journal articles were also altered to downplay environmental impacts. A 2013 survey of more than 4,000 Canadian government scientists found a similar rate (24%) of information for the media being altered or excluded for non-scientific reasons. In Australia, public commentary was most commonly curtailed on issues related to threatened species. “The public often remains ‘in the dark’ about the true state and trends of many species,” wrote one survey respondent.

Managers modifying communications shared in government departments is particularly concerning, says ecologist Don Driscoll of Deakin University outside Melbourne, who led the study. It suggests that for controversial issues, such as the environmental impacts of mining or land clearing, “the information is not getting right through to the decision makers”.

Although university scientists reported fewer restrictions on communicating their work, Cunningham says that they are not immune to pressures that can prevent them from speaking out. “Many prominent researchers in my school receive threats of violence as a result of their work,” he says. That’s “not going to be good for your mental health, and it might also shape your willingness to speak publicly about contentious issues”, he says.

Just under half of the survey respondents reported being harassed or criticized for speaking out. The Ecological Society of Australia has now set up a permanent online portal where instances of science suppression can be anonymously reported.

Most scientists felt the main consequences of being blocked or refraining from speaking about their work was that vested interest groups then dominated public debates and could mislead people, and that relevant data were not used to inform policies.

The remedy

Driscoll says that one way to reduce employer interference and improve transparency is to establish an independent environment commission that provides policy advice and has guaranteed funding. The commissioner in charge would need security of tenure, “so that they can’t be sacked every time there’s an election”, says Driscoll. This happened in 2013, when a newly elected conservative government disbanded a climate commission set up two years earlier to act as an advisory board to government on climate science.

New Zealand has had an independent parliamentary commissioner for the environment since 1986, to provide independent reports and advice on environmental issues to the parliament.

Policies and codes of conduct that stipulate how science should be communicated can also be helpful for scientists working in government departments, says Driscoll. In 2018, the Canadian government adopted a scientific-integrity policy for the public service, which directs departments employing scientists to ensure that communication is free from political, commercial and stakeholder interference, and that scientific information is made available to the public in a timely manner.

“I don’t think there’s a simple solution,” says Cunningham, but “it’s important to pursue some of these sorts of institutional changes and policy changes that can create a little bit of protection for ideas”."
"We Don't Want to Alarm Anyone, But a Large Amount of Siberia Is on Fire Right Now",https://www.sciencealert.com/so-i-don-t-want-to-alarm-anyone-but-a-huge-amount-of-siberia-is-on-fire,"For the Northern Hemisphere, spring is here – a time to start packing away winter jackets, and enjoying sunbaking on the deck.

But increasing warmth can also bring fires, and in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the situation is already looking pretty dire.

Russian Emergencies Minister Evgeny Zinichev has said that in Krasnoyarsk, 10 times as much territory was ablaze on April 27 compared to the same time last year, while in Transbaikal it was three times, and in the Amur region it was one and a half times as much.

In the Transbaikal region alone, this amounts to 200,000 hectares burnt – a larger area than the whole island of Maui, Hawaii.

And unfortunately, the cause is likely the worst mix of climate change, and COVID-19 cabin fever.

According to authorities, the fires have originated from a variety of sources, including out-of-control agricultural fires, arson, and untended campfires.

""People self-isolated outdoors and forgot about fire safety rules,"" says Sergei Anoprienko, head of the federal forest agency Rosleskhoz.

""In some regions, the temperature is already around 30 degrees C [86 degrees F], and people just can't keep themselves in their apartments.""

""People rushed outdoors, and as a result we have a surge of thermal points,"" he added.

NASA's Terra satellite captured images of some of the fires from space on April 27 (below).

(NASA)

Currently, the area is undergoing unusually hot weather and strong winds, which as we saw earlier this year in Australia is a dangerous combination.

NASA reports that winds on April 23 caused many of the fires used by locals to dry out grass to spread uncontrolled.

""The regions of Kemerovo and Novosibirsk among others have been the hardest hit to date,"" the NASA release explains. ""Nine Siberian regions have been affected by these wildfires. Clouds of smoke have swept across the Siberian landscape.""

Scientists have shown that as the global average temperature continues to rise, and we see more and more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, these wildfires will continue to become on average larger, more dangerous, and more frequent.

We already saw some pretty intense wildfires in Siberia in 2017 and 2019, and London School of Economics geographer Thomas Smith told Earther that Russia currently has 2 million hectares of grassland and forest on fire across the continent – which is not far off the horrific July 2019 figures. And it's only May.

Anoprienko warned that it's very early in the season for numbers like this. He explained that by April 28 last year in TransBaikal, 382,000 hectares had been burnt. This year, the area has already had 477,000 burnt hectares.

This is likely only the start of another intense fire season across the Northern Hemisphere. California has had a drier than average winter, and Europe is already experiencing particularly warm weather.

""An abnormally warm winter, an arid spring, and the human factor have made adjustments to our forecasts,' said Anoprienko.

""In May – June, a dangerous period usually begins in Siberia ... We can keep talking about the forecast for a very long time, but the actual fire situation will literally depend on us and you - on how we will behave.""

That probably should be a lesson to all of us."
Hospitals say feds are seizing masks and other coronavirus supplies without a word,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-07/hospitals-washington-seize-coronavirus-supplies,"Although President Trump has directed states and hospitals to secure what supplies they can, the federal government is quietly seizing orders, leaving medical providers across the country in the dark about where the material is going and how they can get what they need to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.

Hospital and clinic officials in seven states described the seizures in interviews over the past week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is not publicly reporting the acquisitions, despite the outlay of millions of dollars of taxpayer money, nor has the administration detailed how it decides which supplies to seize and where to reroute them.

Officials who’ve had materials seized also say they’ve received no guidance from the government about how or if they will get access to the supplies they ordered. That has stoked concerns about how public funds are being spent and whether the Trump administration is fairly distributing scarce medical supplies.

“In order to have confidence in the distribution system, to know that it is being done in an equitable manner, you have to have transparency,” said Dr. John Hick, an emergency physician at Hennepin Healthcare in Minnesota who has helped develop national emergency preparedness standards through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

The medical leaders on the front lines of the fight to control the coronavirus and keep patients alive say they are grasping for explanations. “We can’t get any answers,” said a California hospital official who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation from the White House.

In Florida, a large medical system saw an order for thermometers taken away. And officials at a system in Massachusetts were unable to determine where its order of masks went.

“Are they stockpiling this stuff? Are they distributing it? We don’t know,” one official said. “And are we going to ever get any of it back if we need supplies? It would be nice to know these things.”

PeaceHealth, a 10-hospital system in Washington, Oregon and Alaska, had a shipment of testing supplies seized recently. “It’s incredibly frustrating,” said Richard DeCarlo, the system’s chief operating officer.

“We had put wheels in motion with testing and protective equipment to allow us to secure and protect our staff and our patients,” he said. “When testing went off the table, we had to come up with a whole new plan.”

Although PeaceHealth doesn’t have hospitals in the Seattle area, where the first domestic coronavirus outbreak occurred, the system has had a steady stream of potentially infected patients who require testing and care by doctors and nurse in full protective equipment.

Trump and other White House officials, including his close advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner, have insisted that the federal government is using a data-driven approach to procure supplies and direct them where they are most needed.

In response to questions from The Times, a FEMA representative said the agency, working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, has developed a system for identifying needed supplies from vendors and distributing them equitably.

The representative said the agency factors in the populations of states and major metropolitan areas and the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in various locales. “High-transmission areas were prioritized, and allocations were based on population, not on quantities requested,” the representative said.

But the agency has refused to provide any details about how these determinations are made or why it is choosing to seize some supply orders and not others. Administration officials also will not say what supplies are going to what states.

Using the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that allows the president to compel the production of vital equipment in a national emergency, Trump last month ordered General Motors to produce ventilators to address shortfalls at hospitals.

The law also empowers federal agencies to place orders for critical materials and to see that those get priority over orders from private companies or state and local governments.

Experts say judicious use of this authority could help bring order to the medical supply market by routing critical material — ventilators, masks and other protective gear — from suppliers to the federal government and then to areas of greatest need, such as New York.

Yet there is little indication that federal officials are controlling the market, as hospitals, doctors and others report paying exorbitant prices or resorting to unorthodox maneuvers to get what they need.

Hospital and health officials describe an opaque process in which federal officials sweep in without warning to expropriate supplies.

Jose Camacho, who heads the Texas Assn. of Community Health Centers, said his group was trying to purchase a small order of just 20,000 masks when his supplier reported that the order had been taken.

Camacho was flabbergasted. Several of his member clinics — which as primary care centers are supposed to alleviate pressure on overburdened hospitals — are struggling to stay open amid woeful shortages of protective equipment.

“Everyone says you are supposed to be on your own,” Camacho said, noting Trump’s repeated admonition that states and local health systems cannot rely on Washington for supplies. “Then to have this happen, you just sit there wondering what else you can do. You can’t fight the federal government.”"
43 Million Americans Are About to Lose Their Health Insurance Because of Our Employer-Based Health Care System,https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/05/health-insurance-coronavirus-unemployment-medicare-for-all,"“If you like your health care plan, you can keep it!” For years this simple, effusive rallying cry has been the informal slogan animating liberal opposition to a single-payer, Medical-for-All system. Initially popularized during the Obama administration’s reform efforts in 2009, the mantra has since been taken up, ironically enough, by those most hostile to real reform.

The problem with “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,” and its misleading intimation of personal freedom and choice, has always been the same: in a system where health care for millions is actually contingent on their employment status, many lack either freedom or choice when it comes to how they’re insured against illness or injury — if indeed they’re lucky enough to be insured at all. Many employers are at liberty to switch employee plans at will and those who lose their jobs are liable to lose their coverage entirely.

More strongly than any other single moment in recent American history, the coronavirus pandemic is revealing the deep dysfunction of a system in which health and work are so intimately bound together. As a new report published by the DC-based Urban Institute rather ominously illustrates, as many as forty-three million Americans — and possibly even more — could lose their health insurance as the measures taken in response to the pandemic create spiraling unemployment on a scale unseen since the Great Depression.

Unemployment projections for the months ahead vary.

Almost thirty million workers filed unemployment claims between the middle of March and the end of April with the report’s authors citing short-term forecasts that place the national unemployment rate somewhere between 15 and 20 percent by June. Other forecasts are still more dire. Ratings agency S&P expects unemployment to hit 19 percent this month. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, predicts it may reach as high as 30 percent — which would greatly exceed both the 10 percent figure reached in October 2009 and the 25 percent unemployment rate hit in 1933 during the worst ravages of the Great Depression.

Taking this uncertainty into account, the Urban Institute’s analysts provide separate estimates as to how many workers will be thrown off their employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) under different unemployment scenarios. If unemployment hits 20 percent, just over forty-three million Americans will lose their ESI — the figure being a staggering fifty-six million should it reach 25 percent. Though some will qualify for Medicaid or be able to purchase individual coverage for themselves (income permitting), the report’s authors find that millions will become completely uninsured even in less pessimistic unemployment scenarios. Ultimately, as many as 7.5 million Americans could lose insurance entirely in the event the unemployment rate climbs to 25 percent.

Despite years of concerted opposition from industry groups and leading Democratic politicians, a poll conducted by Morning Consult last month found that support for a single-payer, Medicare-for-All system is now at record numbers. Its popularity notwithstanding, some Democrats in the House are currently pushing to include protections sought by the private health insurance lobby in the next coronavirus relief package even as companies like UnitedHealth, Humana, and Cigna report continued profits."
WATER will be traded in Wall Street soon,https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/water-will-be-traded-in-wall-street-soon,"Markets are known to be future looking and that is exactly, it is doing by introducing water as the new trading commodity. According to a Bloomberg report, Wall Street is about to start trading futures contracts on the state’s water supply.

This is the first of its kind in the U.S. and is being created by CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange.

This trade is intended at allowing California’s big water consumers — like almond farms and municipalities — to hedge against surging prices and can act as a benchmark that signals how acute water scarcity is becoming in the state and, more broadly, across the globe. The recent fire in California has brought to light that the climate change issue will not stop anytime soon. Apart from California in the US, large parts of Asia and Africa are displaying early signs of scarcity as temperature soars.

Almost two-thirds of the world’s population is expected to face water shortages by 2025, according to the CME.

“Water scarcity is certainly one of the biggest challenges facing communities and individuals today across the globe, where currently about 2 billion people are already living in countries experiencing high water stress,"" Tim McCourt, the global head of equity index and alternative investment products at CME, said in an interview.

Wall Street first took significant note of the potential for water after investor Michael Burry drew attention to the commodity 10 years ago when he spoke about investing in farmland with “water on site.""

In California, about 40 per cent of water currently consumed in the state goes to crop production. The CME contract will help to create a forward curve so users can hedge future price risk, the bourse said.

“What we really wanted to be able to do was firstly to provide clear and transparent rules-based information to the marketplace,"" said Patrick Wolf, a senior manager for Nasdaq Global Indexes."
Attacks on Greta Thunberg Come from a Coordinated Network of Climate Change Deniers,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/attacks-greta-thunberg-climate-deniers,"This piece originally appeared in DeSmog Blog. It is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

“Freak yachting accidents do happen…”

That was how British businessman, Trump ally, and Brexit bankroller Arron Banks responded to the news that Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen who inspired the school climate strikes movement, was sailing to America to attend the UN Climate Action Summit. His scorn was not unique.

Many people have already spilled thousands of words of commentary explaining how personal attacks on Greta — often lobbed by old white men, sometimes mocking her Aspergers — are unacceptable. But understanding where those attackers come from, ideologically and professionally, casts an important light on some of their dark statements.

That’s because a large subsection of the commentariat driving the abuse of Greta is part of an established network of radical free-marketeer lobby groups — a network that has firm ties to the fossil fuel industry and funders of climate science denial.

European Attacks

Greta first shot to prominence in Europe, and that’s where the earliest mudslinging emerged.

Banks’ tweet was one of the most high-profile. He is among the most prominent funders of Brexit, with long-standing ties to the UK Independence Party and its former leader Nigel Farage. UKIP’s politician, Neil Hamilton, was one of the first to be called out for posting what was perceived by many as a bullying tweet directed at Greta, who is 16 years old.

Farage has now set up a new outfit, the Brexit Party, also bankrolled by Banks. The party has 29 members in the European Parliament, many of them climate science deniers, thanks to winning 30 percent of the vote in May’s elections.

While resisting calls to form an official alliance, the Brexit Party MEPs join other far-right populist parties in Brussels, including Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (formerly the Front National) and Alternative for Germany (AfD). All are united in their hatred for Greta. Two National Rally MPs recently boycotted her visit to France, and AfD representatives have made coordinated attacks on social media.

Those aggressions were orchestrated by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) — an organization known for co-sponsoring events with U.S. free-market think tank, the Heartland Institute.

Trans-Atlantic Potshots

It’s perhaps unsurprising to find that many of the U.S. commentators verbally assaulting Greta also have ties to the Heartland Institute, given the organisation’s Big Oil funding and long-history of promoting climate science denial."
Scientists didn’t expect wildfires this terrible for another 30 years,https://grist.org/climate/scientists-didnt-expect-wildfires-this-terrible-for-another-30-years/,"This year has been hell on earth, in more ways than one. Catastrophic blazes have spanned the planet from Australia to the Arctic, and wildfires have torched large swaths of the western United States, all fulfilling forecasts much faster than scientists had predicted. It’s as if the wildfires of 2050 are already here.

California’s wildfire season is far from over, and it has already scorched 4 million acres of land, more than twice the previous record. A spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection called the milestone “unfathomable.” It echoes the disaster in Australia earlier this year, which researchers called “a fiery wake-up call for climate science.”

People are breaking out new terminology to describe the disaster. On Monday, the August Complex fires — a collection in northern California that recently merged — scorched 1 million acres, becoming the state’s first gigafire in modern history. And you thought megafires (which burn more than 100,000 acres) were bad.

Scientists didn’t predict fires of this scale until between 2040 and 2060, said Matthew Hurteau, an associate professor at the University of New Mexico who studies fire in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

I've had tightness in my chest for 8 weeks. Not because I've had family evacuated or fire threatening my res. site, but because our simulations are wrong. We projected big fires for sure, but later this century. Climate impacts are happening faster than we thought they would. — Matthew Hurteau (@MatthewHurteau) September 28, 2020

Climate scientists’ predictions tend to be pretty conservative, so the record-breaking fire season could force a reckoning. After all, if this is what fires look like now — thanks to the future showing up 30 years early — it’s time to rethink forecasts. The blazes are already changing some projections for California, Hurteau said.

So why were the estimates so far off? One explanation is that scientists work with data that already exists, and the evidence simply didn’t support the prospect of such gigafires, until now. That’s not to say that scientists thought it was out of the question.

“What comes out of the peer review process is reined in from what some of us think is going to happen,” Hurteau said. “Everybody I know who works on climate-related stuff has had conversations about how we think it’s worse than our research shows.”

Contrary to claims that they are “alarmist,” scientists actually tend to underestimate the effects of the climate crisis. A 2012 paper, for instance, found that scientists’ projections downplayed the risks of the potential disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The authors suggested that this tendency to underestimate future changes comes out of pressure to appear balanced and objective.

Wildfires are hard to predict, from the conditions that fan their flames to how and where they’ll ignite. Peering into the crystal ball is already hard enough without having to account for complicated factors like rainfall, wind speed, land cover, and local topography.

Hurteau thinks there’s “a clear climate signal” in the destructive fires we’ve seen across the globe in recent years. When the atmosphere warms, he explained, it sucks moisture out of the land, drying out trees and shrubs and making them more flammable. Of course, forest management is also a factor. Before settlers took over the Western U.S. and started suppressing fires, indigenous peoples used small burns to prevent runaway fires.

“When you take that buildup of fuel and then you make it more available to burn by turning up the thermostat and drying it out more, that’s the recipe for big fires,” Hurteau said.

What’s different, and what he finds especially worrying, is that some fires in California are burning through areas that just burned a couple of years ago, such as the LNU Lightning Complex, a series of fires that scorched much of Wine Country in northern California this fall. “Basically, fire having just occurred within the recent past may not be as much of an impediment to subsequent fires occurring as we thought it might,” Hurteau said.

To make fires less destructive, Hurteau suggests that local governments need to change codes to make buildings less like fuel for flames. Mandating that roofs are made with flame-resistant materials can prevent homes from combusting when embers land on them. And especially in drought-ridden places like California, Hurteau said, “we’ve got to get managed fire back into these ecosystems.”

Then, of course, there’s the matter of global greenhouse gas emissions. “I hope that people are starting to wake up to the fact that we’ve got a period of time when we need to act pretty quickly,” he said."
Scientists endorse mass civil disobedience to force climate ...,http://news.trust.org/item/20191013012429-9u1nq/,"""The urgency of the crisis is now so great that many scientists feel, as humans, that we now have a moral duty to take radical action""

By Matthew Green

LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Almost 400 scientists have endorsed a civil disobedience campaign aimed at forcing governments to take rapid action to tackle climate change, warning that failure could inflict ""incalculable human suffering.""

In a joint declaration, climate scientists, physicists, biologists, engineers and others from at least 20 countries broke with the caution traditionally associated with academia to side with peaceful protesters courting arrest from Amsterdam to Melbourne.

Wearing white laboratory coats to symbolise their research credentials, a group of about 20 of the signatories gathered on Saturday to read out the text outside London's century-old Science Museum in the city's upmarket Kensington district.

""We believe that the continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful and non-violent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law,"" said Emily Grossman, a science broadcaster with a PhD in molecular biology. She read the declaration on behalf of the group.

""We therefore support those who are rising up peacefully against governments around the world that are failing to act proportionately to the scale of the crisis,"" she said.

The declaration was coordinated by a group of scientists who support Extinction Rebellion, a civil disobedience campaign that formed in Britain a year ago and has since sparked offshoots in dozens of countries.

The group launched a fresh wave of international actions on Monday, aiming to get governments to address an ecological crisis caused by climate change and accelerating extinctions of plant and animal species.

A total of 1,307 volunteers had since been arrested at various protests in London by 2030 GMT on Saturday, Extinction Rebellion said. A further 1,463 volunteers have been arrested in the past week in another 20 cities, including Brussels, Amsterdam, New York, Sydney and Toronto, according to the group's tally. More protests in this latest wave are due in the coming days.

While many scientists have shunned overt political debate, fearing that being perceived as activists might undermine their claims to objectivity, the 395 academics who had signed the declaration by 1100 GMT on Sunday chose to defy convention.

""The urgency of the crisis is now so great that many scientists feel, as humans, that we now have a moral duty to take radical action,"" Grossman told Reuters.

Other signatories included several scientists who contributed to the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has produced a series of reports underscoring the urgency of dramatic cuts in carbon emissions.

""We can't allow the role of scientists to be to just write papers and publish them in obscure journals and hope somehow that somebody out there will pay attention,"" Julia Steinberger, an ecological economist at the University of Leeds and a lead IPCC author, told Reuters.

""We need to be rethinking the role of the scientist and engage with how social change happens at a massive and urgent scale,"" she said. ""We can't allow science as usual.""

Extinction Rebellion's flag is a stylised symbol of an hourglass in a circle, and its disruptive tactics include peacefully occupying bridges and roads.

The group has electrified supporters who said they had despaired at the failure of conventional campaigning to spur action. But its success in paralysing parts of London has also angered critics who complained the movement has inconvenienced thousands of people and diverted police resources.

Extinction Rebellion is aligned with a school strike movement inspired by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, which mobilised millions of young people on Sept. 20. It hopes the scientists' support for the urgency of its message and its embrace of civil disobedience will bolster its legitimacy and draw more volunteers.

The group said more than half the signatories of the declaration are experts in the fields of climate science and the loss of wildlife. Although British universities and institutes were well represented, signatories also worked in countries including the United States, Australia, Spain and France.

Deep sea robots have found what could be nearly a half million barrels of acid DDT sludge on the ocean floor off the coast of California,https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/,"No one could see it — until now

The robot made its way 3,000 feet down to the bottom, beaming bright lights and a camera as it slowly skimmed the seafloor. At this depth and darkness, the uncharted topography felt as eerie as driving through a vast desert at night.

The UC Santa Barbara scientist was supposed to be studying methane seeps that day, but with a deep-sea robot on loan and a few hours to spare, now was the chance to confirm an environmental abuse that others in the past could not. He was chasing a hunch, and sure enough, initial sonar scans pinged back a pattern of dots that popped up on the map like a trail of breadcrumbs.

Not far from Santa Catalina Island, in an ocean shared by divers and fishermen, kelp forests and whales, David Valentine decoded unusual signals underwater that gave him chills.

DDT is so stable it can take generations to break down. It doesn’t really dissolve in water but stores easily in fat. Compounding these problems is what scientists today call “biomagnification”: the toxin accumulating in the tissues of animals in greater and greater concentrations as it moves up the food chain.

Her revolutionary book “Silent Spring” evoked the sudden silence of songbirds missing in the skies — alerting unknowing people to the dangers of long-term exposure, even in tiny doses, to a chemical that they could not physically avoid.

Rachel Carson, a marine biologist, heeded these words in 1962 and ignited a movement against what she called “the reckless and irresponsible poisoning of the world that man shares with all other creatures.”

Even Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller, who won a Nobel Prize in 1948 for discovering DDT as a pesticide, cautioned that he himself did not fully understand how the chemical interacted with the living world. Decades of painstaking study still lay ahead for biologists, he said.

But there were two edges to this sword. A top U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist had urged the military not to allow DDT insecticides for commercial use without further research, worried about “the effect they may have on soils and on the whole balance of nature.”

Manufacturers rushed to supply the postwar demand — including Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, which opened its plant near Torrance in 1947. The chemical industry was celebrated at the time for boosting the nation into greater prosperity and preventing crop failures across the globe. The United States used as much as 80 million pounds of DDT in one year.

Once hailed as a major scientific achievement, DDT combated both malaria and typhus during World War II. It was so potent that a single application could protect a soldier for months. The U.S. Army’s chief of preventive medicine, Brig. Gen. James Simmons, famously praised the chemical as “the war’s greatest contribution to the future health of the world.”

Rallying for the deep ocean is not easy, Valentine acknowledged, even though we rely on the health of these waters far more than we know: “The fact that there could be half a million barrels down there … we owe it to ourselves to figure out what happened, what’s actually down there and how much it’s all spreading.”

Decades of bureaucracy and competing environmental issues have diverted the public’s attention. Valentine hoped digging up physical evidence from the seafloor would get more people to care, but calls and emails to numerous officials since his discovery have gone nowhere.

The contamination in sea lions and dolphins continues to stump scientists, and the near extinction of falcons and bald eagles shows how poisoning one corner of the world can ripple across the whole ecosystem.

Signs warning of tainted fish to this day still cover local piers. Recent studies show our immune systems may be compromised. A new generation of women — exposed to DDT from their mothers, who were exposed by their mothers — grapples with the still-mysterious risks of breast cancer.

The world today wrestles with microplastics, bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and other toxics so unnatural they don’t seem to ever go away. But DDT — the all-but-indestructible compound dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, which first stunned and jolted the public into environmental action — persists as an unsolved and largely forgotten problem.

One sediment sample showed DDT concentrations 40 times greater than the highest contamination recorded at the Superfund site — a federally designated area of hazardous waste that officials had contained to shallower waters near Palos Verdes.

The ocean buried the evidence for generations, but modern technology can take scientists to new depths. In 2011 and 2013, Valentine and his research team were able to identify about 60 barrels and collect a few samples during brief forays at the end of other research missions.

Regulators reported in the 1980s that the men in charge of getting rid of the DDT waste sometimes took shortcuts and just dumped it closer to shore. And when the barrels were too buoyant to sink on their own, one report said, the crews simply punctured them.

Shipping logs show that every month in the years after World War II, thousands of barrels of acid sludge laced with this synthetic chemical were boated out to a site near Catalina and dumped into the deep ocean — so vast that, according to common wisdom at the time, it would dilute even the most dangerous poisons.

An epic Superfund battle later exposed the company’s disposal of toxic waste through sewage pipes that poured into the ocean — but all the DDT that was barged out to sea drew comparatively little attention.

As many as half a million of these barrels could still be underwater right now, according to interviews and a Times review of historical records, manifests and undigitized research. From 1947 to 1982, the nation’s largest manufacturer of DDT — a pesticide so powerful that it poisoned birds and fish — was based in Los Angeles.

Tales of this buried secret bubbling under the sea had haunted Valentine for years: a largely unknown chapter in the most infamous case of environmental destruction off the coast of Los Angeles — one lasting decades, costing tens of millions of dollars, frustrating generations of scientists. The fouling of the ocean was so reckless, some said, it seemed unimaginable.

“It has been sitting here this whole time, right off our shore.”

“Holy crap. This is real,” Valentine said. “This stuff really is down there.

Similarly, sea lions with more than 1,000 ppm in their blubber were giving birth to pups prematurely. Bottlenose dolphins had concentrations as high as 2,000 ppm.

Scientists discovered that the chemicals led to eggshells so thin that the chicks would die. Bald eagles had also vanished from the Channel Islands, along with peregrine falcons and the brown pelicans.

In that same year, California brown pelicans, which eat the fish, laid eggs on Anacapa Island with chemicals broken down from DDT averaging 1,200 ppm.

In 1969, shipments of jack mackerel from Southern California were recalled because DDT levels were as high as 10 parts per million, or ppm — double what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered safe for consumption at that time.

Consider phytoplankton, the microscopic algae that are the base for almost all food webs in the ocean.

Montrose executives aggressively defended DDT through the 1960s as the public reckoned with these alarming new concerns about food chains and poisoned ecosystems. They said in letters and editorials that DDT played a vital role in society when properly used and was not a serious threat to human health. They accused environmentalists of scare tactics and misleading information and touted the company’s reputation of making the best DDT in the world — a technical grade sold to other firms that would then dilute it into specific insecticides. The company was supplying governments from Brazil to India, they said, and even the World Health Organization. International malaria eradication programs turned to Montrose for supplies. But after years of intense inquiries, government officials said they were convinced that the chemical posed unacceptable risks to the environment and potential harm to human health. In 1972, the U.S. finally banned the use of DDT. Demand was still strong in other countries, however, so the chemical plant in Los Angeles kept churning out more. Montrose managed to operate for another 10 years before the factory, looming over Normandie Avenue near Del Amo Boulevard, finally went dark.

In the early 1980s, a young scientist at the California Regional Water Quality Control Board in Los Angeles heard whispers that Montrose once dumped barrels of toxic waste directly into the ocean. People at the time were hyper-focused on the contamination problems posed by poorly treated sewage, but Allan Chartrand was curious about the deep-sea dumping and started poking around. He called Montrose, and to his surprise, the staff pulled out all their files. He and a team of regulatory scientists combed through volumes of shipping logs, which showed that more than 2,000 barrels of DDT-laced sludge were dumped each month. They did the math: Between 1947 and 1961, as much as 767 tons of DDT could have gone into the ocean. “We found actual photos of the workers at 2 in the morning dumping — not only dumping barrels off of the barges in the middle of the Santa Monica Basin,” he said, “but before they would dump the barrels, they would take a big ax or hatchet to them, and cut them open on purpose so they would sink.” A 1958 shipping log shows that 2,310 barrels of “acid sludge” from Montrose Chemical Corporation were dumped in the ocean in the month of January. On a recent morning, Chartrand rummaged through stacks of yellowing papers and reports detailing everything he had discovered so many decades ago. Now a seasoned eco-toxicologist in Seattle, he never understood why all this information wound up gathering dust — undigitized and largely forgotten. He pulled out faded reports that his team had published from 1985 to 1989, summarizing what they had found at Montrose and in the water quality control board’s own records. “This makes my heart sing,” he said, as he reread conclusions that still resonate today. Allan Chartrand flips through old copies of his studies from the 1980s. (Rosanna Xia / Los Angeles Times) Chartrand said he was astonished to learn this kind of activity was allowed. Federal ocean dumping laws dated back to 1886, but the rules were focused on clearing the way for ship navigation. It wasn’t until the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, also known as the Ocean Dumping Act, that environmental impacts were considered. Dumping industrial chemicals near Catalina was an accepted practice for decades. Landfills could hold only so much, and people were concerned about burning toxics into the air — but the Pacific Ocean seemed a good alternative. Explosives, oil refinery waste, trash and rotting meats all went into the ocean, along with beryllium, various acid sludges, even cyanide. Dilution is the solution to pollution, the saying used to go, but at what cost? The ocean covers more than 70% of the planet, but it can absorb only so much. What we eat, what we breathe is ultimately dictated by what we do to the sea. “It’s just sad, sad, sad,” Chartrand said. “When stuff’s being dumped offshore like that, it’s in the dead of night, nobody’s seeing it. It’s out of sight, out of mind.” For years, a company called California Salvage docked at the Port of Los Angeles, loaded up Montrose’s DDT waste and hauled everything out to sea. Workers were instructed to dump in a designated spot, dubbed Dumpsite No. 1, that was about 10 nautical miles northwest of Catalina. Each container was individually broken before disposal overboard. Drums containing chemicals were emptied and allowed to sink after holes were placed in the top, bottom and sides. — Chartrand et al, March 1985 But compliance inspections were infrequent, and crews sometimes took shortcuts. Chartrand discovered notes from California Salvage indicating they had decided to dump elsewhere because Dumpsite No. 1 was in line of a naval weapons firing range. The report concluded that these companies likely dumped in closer, much shallower waters. “Our report caught them red-handed,” Chartrand said. “Here I was this young guy — newly married, just had my first kid, got my new job at the water quality control board — heard about this dumping, went down to Montrose … and it very quickly got so much bigger than me.” In 1990, a few years after Chartrand compiled his reports, the Environmental Protection Agency teamed up with the state and launched a court battle against Montrose and a number of other companies under the Superfund law. Environmental groups expected the lawsuit — the largest in U.S. history alleging natural resource damages from chemical dumping — to be a landmark case in resolving coastal pollution issues. Chartrand and dozens of others were pulled in to testify. Science was disputed in court, evidence debated, expertise challenged. In numerous depositions, former factory workers were grilled on how they operated. Bernard Bratter, a Montrose plant superintendent, described how they would call California Salvage to dump its acid waste in bulk: “The trucks would come in, we’d load the trucks, they would then haul them down to the harbor where they had their barges, and the truck would unload into the barge, and when there was enough liquid in the barge, they’d haul the barge out to the specified area in the ocean and release the acid.” Montrose officials, who had filed counterclaims, asked the court to exclude the evidence presented on ocean dumping — arguing that such dumping wasn’t relevant. They said the government’s natural resources damage claim was based solely on the release of DDT through the sewer system to the Palos Verdes shelf, and that attorneys could not prove that Montrose’s disposal of DDT-contaminated waste into the deep ocean actually hurt various bird species. They also questioned Chartrand’s calculations of how much DDT went into the ocean and made the point that there was nothing secret or illegal about the dumping at the time. The government, they said, allowed this to happen. In an interoffice correspondence in 1985, Samuel Rotrosen, Montrose’s president at the time, wrote that “it is true that from 1947, when the plant started up, until sometime in the 1950s we disposed of our waste sulfuric acid at sea through California Salvage Company who barged it out to state-approved dumping areas. “We stopped this disposal after we installed our acid-recovery plant, at which time we sold the acid to fertilizer makers,” he said. “Because our acid contained traces of DDT (50-250 ppm) … the fertilizer producers would no longer take it, and so we disposed of it at landfills.” Three decades after regulatory scientists found evidence of men taking an ax to these waste barrels before dumping them overboard, an underwater robot came across barrels on the seafloor with puncture marks. (David Valentine / ROV Jason) As the court battle waged on, a handful of curious scientists kept trying to solve the DDT questions at the bottom of the ocean. Chartrand did not have a deep-sea robot, but he figured out a way to collect sediment samples and clumps of tar by dragging a large otter trawl net along the seafloor. He also took samples of rattails, kelp bass and other fish from different depths of the ocean. He called Robert Risebrough, a legend among DDT scientists whose testimonies in the 1960s and early 1970s helped Congress understand why the chemical should be banned. Risebrough, a UC Santa Cruz research ecologist at the time, ran the samples and authored a sweeping study. He confirmed the existence of considerable concentrations of DDT chemicals in both the sediments and the “tar cakes” by the dumpsites. It was unclear how much the DDT could move through the water at such depths, where there is little oxygen, he said, but the dumping was close enough to the Channel Islands that the upwelling of deeper water common in this area could stir up what enters the food chain. And if the barrels were indeed punctured, he added, some of the sludge could have leaked out on its way down to the seafloor. He had a strong suspicion that the disappearance of bald eagles from Catalina was connected to the dumping operations, but he didn’t have the data to confirm it. DDT contamination was also significantly higher in birds that fed on fish, compared with birds that ate mostly rodents and prey on land — another clue that the DDT from the ocean dumping was harming wildlife. He called for more studies to connect the dots, but Chartrand had run out of funding. Chartrand held on to what he could — even the remaining samples that neither he nor Risebrough could bear to throw away. Some of that deep sea sediment has yet to be tested. “They’re in a deep freeze now, but because it’s DDT, even though it’s been 30, 40 years, they’re still valid,” Chartrand said. “If we could get the funding, those are still worth running.” “They were supposed to take it out to sea. I think beyond the Continental Shelf. But there was a common joke among people that they only took it as far as they needed to, just out of sight, and started dumping right there.” — Deposition of Ferdinand Suhrer, Montrose employee, July 30, 1996 M. Indira Venkatesan, a geochemist at UCLA who studied how chemicals moved through the sea, had taken one of these samples in the early 1990s and run her own analyses. She, too, concluded there must be a DDT source in the ocean much larger than just what had come out of the sewage closer to shore. She collected additional sediment cores from the seafloor by a manual pulley that her technicians and graduate students spent hours pulling up. Her team distinguished the DDT “fingerprint” for Montrose’s ocean-dumped waste and discussed the upward and downward diffusion of DDT in the sediments. “It gets resuspended and remobilized. That’s why you see it all over the basin,” she said. “I knew, I just knew, this DDT source was significant, just from the chemical analysis, but we couldn’t show the extent of the dumping, nor the number of barrels.” Back in court, the arguments were focusing on the more tangible: the hundreds of tons of DDT and PCBs, another toxic chemical, that had been released two miles off the coast of Palos Verdes where the sewage emptied into the ocean. Many saw the need to make this public health problem — much closer to shore, with visible harm to humans and the ecosystem — a top priority. The site — spread across more than 17 square miles — was declared a Superfund cleanup in 1996. About 200 feet deep, it was considered one of the most complicated hazard sites in the United States — at least three times deeper than similar Superfund sites in Boston and New York harbors. The Palos Verdes coast has been contaminated with DDT for decades. The attempted cleanup has become one of the most complicated Superfund projects in the United States. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) By late 2000, the parties decided to settle. They negotiated a consent decree midway through trial — no sides admitting fault, with an agreement that more than $140 million would be paid by Montrose, several other companies that owned or operated a share of the plant, and local governments led by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. The settlement — one of the largest in the nation for an environmental damage claim — would pay for cleanup, habitat restoration and education programs for people at risk of eating contaminated fish. “This Decree was negotiated ... in good faith at arm’s length to avoid the continuation of expensive and protracted litigation and is a fair and equitable settlement of claims which were vigorously contested,” according to the decree, which mentioned that the damage claim includes “any ocean dumpsites used for disposing of wastes from the Montrose Plant Property.” From 1947 to 1982, the nation’s largest manufacturer of DDT operated in Los Angeles on Normandie Avenue near Del Amo Boulevard. The property is considered one of the most hazardous sites in the United States. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Attorneys representing Montrose, when contacted by The Times, declined to comment on the new underwater data and noted that the ocean claims related to the DDT operation were resolved 20 years ago. Litigation continues to this day over other impacts from the former plant. In August, a $56.6-million settlement was finally reached over groundwater contamination. Back at UCLA, on a recent morning in the geology building, Venkatesan thought ruefully back to those DDT years. KCBS had run a local news series on the barrels, and The Times followed the story for a brief period. The information caught the attention of Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the 1960s activist turned lawmaker who married Jane Fonda and was remembered as “the radical inside the system.” For a few years, he pushed for more information about the barrels and an action plan, but so many unchecked environmental problems demanded attention back then. Even Venkatesan got pulled away. As public concerns shifted from water to air pollution, her research focus changed to aerosols. She had tried for a while longer to get the word out — giving public lectures in Santa Monica bookstores and telling whoever would listen that the deep ocean also needed healing. “I didn’t know what to do with this data; I felt bad,” she said. “As scientists, we thought we could leave it to the politicians and the government to do their job…. But if the government is not proactive, then people don’t care. If people don’t care, then the government doesn’t do anything.” Now that she’s retired, her filing cabinets — filled with her work since she started in 1975 — have been moved into a basement at UCLA. She recently reviewed the data that the UC Santa Barbara researchers had uncovered with deep-sea robots, which validated Chartrand’s estimates, as well as her own. She held out her hands and said she was trembling with excitement, knowing that people might care about this issue again. “Disposing any waste, where you don’t see and forget about it, does not solve the problem,” she said. “The problem eventually comes back to haunt us.”

One afternoon in Santa Barbara, hunched over a computer humming with data, Valentine and Veronika Kivenson, a PhD student in marine science, scrolled through the eerie images they had gathered underwater. They leaned in to examine an icicle-like anomaly growing off one of the barrels — a “toxicle,” they called it — and wondered about the gas that bubbled out when the robot snapped one off. To have gas supersaturated in and around these barrels so deep underwater, where the pressure was 90 times greater than above ground, was unsettling. They couldn’t help but feel like they were poking at a giant Coke can ready to explode. About 60 barrels were visually identified by Jason, a remotely operated robot that also collected samples of nearby sediment with large tubes, top. One spot had a DDT concentration 40 times higher than the highest level of surface contamination recorded at the Palos Verdes Superfund site. (David Valentine / ROV Jason) One thing was clear, Kivenson said: This stuff is spreading. She had tried to collect sediment many meters from the barrels as a baseline to compare the samples collected right next to the source. But the baseline turned out to also have similarly high concentrations of DDT — most of them higher than the permissible threshold established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “These barrels do seem to be leaking over time,” she said. “This toxic waste is just kind of bubbling down there, seeping, oozing, I don’t know what word I want to use. ... It’s not a contained environment.” So much of this data, collected in 2011 and then again in 2013, came down to timing and good luck: The underwater robots had been on loan for a different project, but that research cruise was ahead of schedule, so they had a window of extra time to explore. A scientist involved in the discovery of the Titanic happened to be on board, so he helped them program the robots on where to go and how to search for the barrels. A marine geochemistry lab at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ran the samples, and Kivenson, whose graduate fellowship and tuition were the only funding for this research, analyzed them for her PhD. Scientists aboard the research vessel Atlantis guide Sentry, an autonomous underwater vehicle, down into the water to scope out the seafloor. (David Valentine / UC Santa Barbara) She tracked down the patent for the DDT acid waste that supposedly went into the barrels. She combed through EBay for out-of-print research books on ocean dumping and flipped through rolls of microfilm in the archive rooms of court buildings and government agencies. She validated Venkatesan’s conclusion that the DDT near the barrels did not have the same characteristics as the Superfund site — ruling out the possibility that this was just DDT from Palos Verdes that somehow traveled farther into the ocean and settled onto the deep seafloor. One key difference was that the barrel samples contained no PCBs, which are abundant in the contamination near the sewage outfall. Each barrel seemed to contain acid waste with about 0.5% to 2% technical-grade DDT — which, at half a million barrels, would amount to a total of 384 to 1,535 tons of DDT on the seafloor. The distribution was patchy; one hot spot had a concentration of DDT that was 40 times higher than the highest level of surface sediment contamination recorded at the Superfund site. All told, she concluded that the total amount of DDT from the dumping seemed comparable to the estimated 870 to 1,450 tons that had been released through the sewer. When Sentry pinged back anomalies, a larger remotely operated robot named Jason, above, was sent down to take photos and gather samples. (David Valentine / UC Santa Barbara) But in the end, these are still extrapolations — we don’t know how much is actually down there, said Kivenson, who published these findings last year in the journal Environmental Science & Technology and is now a postdoctoral fellow at Oregon State University. Logical next steps would be to somehow map and identify just how many barrels there are, determine any hot spots, and study how much the chemical is leaking and spreading and accumulating. Valentine tried calling those with the power to do something about these barrels: the EPA, which has been in charge of cleaning up the Superfund site. But the EPA, it turns out, hasn’t even figured out what to do with the DDT problem that got all the attention and millions of settlement dollars. After more than 20 years of meetings and high-level studies, the site off the Palos Verdes shore has become its own controversial saga. A pilot experiment more than a decade ago to bury the DDT under a thick cap of clean sand showed mixed results. Then sampling in 2009 suggested that most of the DDT had mysteriously vanished — prompting a burst of headlines and more internal paralysis. The longtime project manager unexpectedly retired, and many of the scientists who had dedicated decades of their careers to the chemical have also either retired or moved on. More than a decade ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency experimented with burying the DDT on the Palos Verdes shelf under a thick cap of clean sand. (Ken Lubas / Los Angeles Times) Many, when reached, said they had not been involved with the site for a number of years. “I feel like something’s happened at the site; it just sort of died. It’s been very weird,” said Robert Eganhouse, a research chemist at the U.S. Geological Survey who had been studying the Superfund site and the breakdown rates of DDT since the 1970s. His last meaningful exchange with the EPA was in late 2016, when he submitted an immense amount of data and a final synthesis report for the site — a research endeavor that took more than eight years and cost millions of dollars. To this day, Eganhouse, who recently retired, is not quite sure what the EPA did with this information. Judy Huang, the Superfund’s project manager for the past decade, when reached by The Times, directed questions to regional headquarters. In an email, an EPA spokeswoman said the agency had suspended capping efforts and collected new data that showed twice as much DDT as the 2009 results. The EPA is now reassessing its approach: “We are updating our evaluation of the mechanisms of how the DDTs and PCBs in the sediment impact human health and the environment in this complex system.” In the meantime, projects to restore local kelp forests, wetlands, seabirds and underwater habitats have been supported over the years with the settlement money, as well as education outreach that helped prevent anglers and vulnerable communities from eating poisoned fish. Fish remain contaminated, but the concentrations seem to be slowly going down, according to findings from the EPA’s most recent five-year review of the site, released last fall. The bald eagles and peregrine falcons are coming back after years of human assistance, and nature seems to be healing itself over time. After all these years of costly stops and stalls, some think a so-called monitored natural recovery approach might just be the best solution. The EPA plans to start a new feasibility study that aims to lead to a final cleanup strategy. That study is not expected to be published for another four years. Mark Gold, who had championed the DDT problem as a marine scientist since the 1990s, could barely find the words to describe how he felt about the attempted cleanup of the Palos Verdes shelf. “To have the EPA say, 25 years later, that maybe the best thing to do is to just let nature take its course is, frankly, nothing short of nauseating,” he said. When asked about the barrels, he was so shocked he had to pause and grab a calculator to process the amount of DDT that could be in the deep ocean. At an absolute minimum, he said, there needs to be further investigation into how much is actually down there and how much this dumping has harmed the ecosystem. Gold, who is now Gov. Gavin Newsom’s deputy secretary for coast and ocean policy, said he had heard stories of illegal dumping back when he was helping state and federal officials build the case against Montrose. But there was no firsthand evidence in the 1990s, he said, nor a sense of whether it was five barrels, 10 or 20. “Nobody in their worst nightmares,” he said, “ever thought there would be half a million barrels of DDT waste dumped into the ocean off of L.A. County’s coast.”

Dilution, it seems, just means the problem re-accumulates elsewhere. In the environmental health laboratory at San Diego State‘s School of Public Health, Eunha Hoh recently discovered the chemical had wound its way into dolphins in unexpected ways. Marine mammals, like humans, nurse their young and live long lives. Slow to evolve, their long-term health is a window into the lasting impacts of chronic exposure and accumulation — and how these chemicals get passed onto babies. As some of the largest predators of the sea, they’re also an important indicator of the ocean’s overall health. So when Hoh sampled the blubber of eight adult dolphins that had lived deeper off the coast of Southern California, she was surprised to find significant amounts of 45 DDT-related compounds. Every dolphin she tested had washed up dead — and had accumulated much more of these chemicals than dolphins tested in Brazil and elsewhere around the world. “DDT contamination — is it really going down in Southern California? Can we really say that, or are we missing something,” said Hoh, who also serves on the California Ocean Protection Council’s science advisory team. “Sure it was banned decades ago, it might be manageable globally, but Southern California? We’re different. Our ocean is so much more polluted with DDT. We cannot just say, ‘That’s done; we can move on to other things.’” Hoh’s expertise is in discovering new chemicals, but she remains mystified by how DDT keeps reappearing in new and unexpected ways. Where, she often wonders, is all this DDT coming from? When she first heard about the barrels scattered across the seafloor, it was as if someone finally handed her missing pieces to a puzzle that had never quite added up. The questions came tumbling out. If that much more DDT is out there but forgotten, and no one knows to study it, she said, how will we ever understand the true legacy of this chemical? The ocean’s health, scientists say, is inseparable from our health and the health of the planet. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times) Current monitoring shows that the local ecosystem, on the whole, is stable. But what’s unclear are these long-term unknowns, said Keith Maruya, who co-authored the dolphin study and retired last year as the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project’s head of chemistry. “It’s not like something’s going off the cliff. But what we don’t know is whether these things are going to have a longer-term, more subtle effect — are some populations really, really slowly going to be declining?” he said. “We don’t know the answer. Moreover, we don’t really have the tools yet to answer that question fully.” He jolted up in his chair when the discovery of the barrels came up in a recent conversation. “Wow. Wait, how many did they find? I need to write this down.” He jotted a few numbers, then silently compared this with the known quantity of DDT dumped at the Superfund site. “If nobody accounted for this second source … if you’ve got twice the amount,” he said, thinking aloud. “It’s such a staggering number, but what does this mean? … The bottom line is always going to be: So what? We have a chemical out there, so what?”

At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in a developmental biology and environmental toxicology lab overlooking the sea, Amro Hamdoun has been pondering this question for much of his life. He’s found through molecular studies that “persistent organic pollutants,” like flame retardants and DDT, can block a key protein from eliminating toxins from the human body — a clue, perhaps, into why they bioaccumulate. Even in small amounts, these contaminants could interfere with the human body’s natural ability to defend itself. Hamdoun teaches “Silent Spring” and DDT to his students as an example of how the world used to be — but can’t help but wonder how much the jobs and science of the future will be dealing with these messes of the past. “There’s a broader problem of thinking of the ocean as this unlimited garbage dump that’s going to take up our CO₂, take up our mercury, deal with the plastic that we don’t throw away properly, be a dumping ground for pesticides, deal with whatever is in runoff — and that our health is going to be separable from that,” he said. “But what we’re learning more and more is that our health and the ocean’s health are pretty inseparable.” At what point, he asked, does it become our prerogative, as people who live in a shared society, to decide what it is that we want to put in our environment — and our bodies? He leaned forward in his chair, hands clasped, head bowed, like Valentine and Chartrand and so many who came before. “These chemicals are still out there, and we haven’t figured out what to do,” he said. “They are an issue, and we still don’t have a plan.”"
Costco limits meat purchases in U.S. as supply shortages loom - America’s biggest meat processor says food supply chain is ‘breaking’ and millions of pounds of meat will vanish from grocery stores,https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/costco-limits-meat-purchases-as-supply-shortages-loom,"Article content

Costco Wholesale Corp said on Monday it had limited the number of beef, pork and poultry products customers can buy, as grocery stores prepare for massive shortages of meat supplies following coronavirus-induced supply disruptions.

Some of the biggest slaughterhouses in the United States closed over the last few weeks as COVID-19 spread widely through meat processing facilities where large groups of employees often work shoulder to shoulder in difficult conditions.

Costco said it would temporarily limit fresh beef, pork and poultry purchases to a total of 3 items per Costco member, following Kroger Co, which has put purchase limits on ground beef and fresh pork at some of its stores.

Starting Monday, Costco will also require all shoppers to wear masks or face coverings to reduce the chances of transmission of the virus.

John Tyson, chairman of the United States’ largest meat processing company Tyson Foods Inc said last week the food supply chain was “breaking” and millions of pounds of meat would vanish from grocery stores in the country.

U.S. President Donald Trump later ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect food supplies, a move that drew backlash from unions that said at-risk workers needed more protection.

The affluent are consuming the planet to death: study,https://www.salon.com/2020/06/23/the-affluent-are-consuming-the-planet-to-death-study/,"A new study published this month in the academic journal Nature Communications argues that, despite all of the talk about using green technology to address man-made environmental problems, the only way for human consumption to become sustainable is if we rein in the affluent.

""The key conclusion from our review is that we cannot rely on technology alone to solve existential environmental problems – like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution – but that we also have to change our affluent lifestyles and reduce overconsumption, in combination with structural change,"" Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales Engineering told that college's newspaper regarding the study.

The paper itself argued that ""the affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts and are central to any future prospect of retreating to safer environmental conditions."" The authors added that ""existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits necessary societal change"" and advocated ""a global and rapid decoupling of detrimental impacts from economic activity,"" pointing out that the efforts made by global North countries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions are ""highly unlikely"" to occur rapidly enough on a global scale to stave off catastrophic environmental impacts.

""This is because renewable energy, electrification, carbon-capturing technologies and even services all have resource requirements, mostly in the form of metals, concrete and land,"" the authors point out. ""Rising energy demand and costs of resource extraction, technical limitations and rebound effects aggravate the problem.""

After observing that ""the world's top 10% of income earners are responsible for between 25 and 43% of environmental impact"" while ""the world's bottom 10% income earners exert only around 3–5% of environmental impact,"" the authors that environmental damage is largely caused by the world's ""affluent"" and therefore needs to be confronted by demanding lifestyle changes among the wealthy.

In other words, the world's poorest have a negligible effect on overall environmental devastation; focusing on their consumption or behavior is a fool's errand when it comes to environmental policy.

""Considering that the lifestyles of wealthy citizens are characterised by an abundance of choice, convenience and comfort, we argue that the determinant and driver we have referred to in previous sections as consumption, is more aptly labelled as affluence,"" the authors point out. They advocate reducing avoiding or reducing consumption ""until the remaining consumption level falls within planetary boundaries, while fulfilling human needs,"" with the wealthy abstain from purchasing overly large homes and secondary residences, large vehicles, excessive quantities of food, and engaging in leisure activities that require a great deal of flying and driving.

The authors also argue for consumption patterns ""to be shifted away from resource and carbon-intensive goods and services, e.g. mobility from cars and airplanes to public buses and trains, biking or walking, heating from oil heating to heat pumps, nutrition — where possible — from animal to seasonal plant-based products."" In addition, they call for ""the adoption of less affluent, simpler and sufficiency-oriented lifestyles to address overconsumption — consuming better but less."" This approach would need to include ""addressing socially unsustainable underconsumption in impoverished communities in both less affluent and affluent countries, where enough and better is needed to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth and guarantee a minimum level of prosperity to overcome poverty.""

The authors acknowledged that there are several schools of thought regarding how to best meet these goals.

""The reformist group consists of heterogeneous approaches such as a-growth, precautionary/pragmatic post-growth, prosperity and managing without growth as well as steady-state economics,"" the authors write. ""These approaches have in common that they aim to achieve the required socio-ecological transformation through and within today's dominant institutions, such as centralised democratic states and market economies."" By contrast the second group, which is ""more radical,"" posits that ""the needed socio-ecological transformation will necessarily entail a shift beyond capitalism and/or current centralised states. Although comprising considerable heterogeneity, it can be divided into eco-socialist approaches, viewing the democratic state as an important means to achieve the socio-ecological transformation and eco-anarchist approaches, aiming instead at participatory democracy without a state, thus minimising hierarchies.""

Salon interviewed several scientists and scholars earlier this month about how the coronavirus pandemic has illustrated many of the sustainability problems inherent in capitalism. One problem with capitalist economic systems is that they rely on constantly increasing consumption in order to maintain periods of prosperity. If unexpected disasters interrupt that consumption — such as the pandemic requiring an economic shutdown — the whole system grinds to a halt.

""Going with the structural metaphor concept, there always huge cracks underneath the facades of capitalism, and the huge weight of this pandemic has widened those cracks,"" Norman Solomon, co-founder and national coordinator of RootsAction.org and a Sanders delegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, told Salon. After pointing out how the poor wind up being hurt the most, he added that ""the entire political economy is geared to overproduction and over-consumption to maximize corporate profits.""

Michael E. Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, told Salon that ""I think that there are larger lessons and messages here about the sustainability of a global population of nearly 8 billion and growing people on a planet with finite resources.""

He added, ""And what COVID-19 has laid bare is the fragility of this massive infrastructure which we've created to artificially maintain consumption far beyond the natural carrying capacity of the planet. And continued exploitation of fossil fuels, obviously, is inconsistent with a sustainable human society."""
Revealed: Scars of Covid-19 could last for life as doctors warn of long-term damage to health to 1 in 3 survivors,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/22/revealed-scars-covid-19-could-last-life-doctors-warn-long-term/,"​One in three patients who recover from coronavirus could be harmed for life, with long-term damage to their lungs, as well as chronic fatigue and psychological disturbances, research suggests.

Experts said there was growing evidence that the virus could cause persistent or even permanent trauma, including impairment to the brain and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

NHS guidance seen by The Telegraph suggests that around 30 per cent of patients who recover from Covid-19 may be left with damaged and scarred lung tissue, if it follows patterns of similar diseases.

This could amount to around 100,000 of the 300,000 people who have so far tested positive in the UK. Limited testing during the pandemic means the figure may be still higher.

Some estimates suggest around 3.5 million people in the UK are likely to have been infected by Covid, meaning that more than 1 million could be left facing long-term consequences.

In an interview with The Telegraph, the head of the new NHS centre for Covid recovery said she was worried about how little was known about just how long the consequences may last.

Dr Hilary Floyd, clinical director at the NHS Seacole Centre, said she had been shocked by how young many of its patients were, with healthy people who were in their 40s and 50s when the virus struck now facing long-term fatigue and disability.

'They may always have some level of debilitation'

Dr Floyd told The Telegraph: “These are people who were independent, they might be running their own business, going to the gym, swimming, active - now they are at the point they can’t get out of bed.

“We have a couple of patients in their 40s at the moment; we really didn’t expect that. We were expecting them to be older, we have seen a lot in their 50s and 60s who are really struggling particularly because their expectation of getting back to normal is much greater.”

She added: “They may always have some level of debilitation.""

The NHS guidance for GPs and community services warns that up to half of patients treated in intensive care units for the virus may be left with “persistent physical, cognitive and psychological impairments”, including chronic fatigue.

So far around 13,000 patients have received such treatment. And one in 10 of those discharged from hospitals in England after treatment for Covid-19 has been left with acute heart injury, it says.

In many cases the fatigue and breathlessness is so severe that patients are only able to do short bursts of 10 minutes supervised activity at a time, Dr Floyd said.

Many patients are also struggling to cope with the psychological impact from the changes to their health, with therapists on site, she said, adding: “There is a lot of anxiety.”"
"As cutoff of $600 weekly benefit and wave of evictions loom, Congress takes a holiday",https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/07/07/lead-j07.html,"With tens of millions of workers facing the triple threat of the cutoff of the $600 weekly federal supplement to their state unemployment compensation, the resumption of evictions in most states, and a renewed upsurge in the coronavirus pandemic, the response of the US Congress was to go on vacation.

The Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate adjourned July 3 without taking up an extension of the $600 weekly supplement provided in the CARES Act, which is set to expire on July 25. Congress will not return to work until Monday, July 20, and there is little prospect that the full supplement will be extended, given intransigent opposition from corporate America, which has branded the payments a “disincentive” to forcing workers back into unsafe workplaces.

The $600 supplement has been a lifeline for tens of millions of workers thrown onto unemployment lines by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. Large numbers of workers, particularly those in part-time and other contingent forms of work, actually saw an increase in income, because combined state and federal benefits brought them up to nearly $1,000 a week--above the official poverty line.

The looming unemployment benefit cutoff coincides with the expiration of temporary eviction moratoriums in 20 states, including Texas and Wisconsin. Eviction bans in nine others are set to expire by the end of the month, as well as the federal ban, which affects only properties insured or underwritten through federal agencies. A study by the real estate firm Amherst projects that almost 28 million households are at risk of eviction due to job losses related to the pandemic.

The Trump administration and most congressional Republicans are opposing renewal of the $600 unemployment supplement, proposing either a complete cutoff, an extension at a much lower level, or the transformation of the unemployment benefit into an incentive bonus for going back to work—essentially paying workers to risk their lives and the lives of their families and friends under conditions of a worsening pandemic.

The same options have been embraced by sections of the Democratic Party, with at least one prominent Democrat, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, a multimillionaire, telling a local Chamber of Commerce that the $600 benefit “discourages work.” Some Senate Democrats have proposed to extend the supplement at lower levels indexed to the official unemployment rate (which grossly undercounts the actual jobless toll).

The House of Representatives passed an extension of the $600 benefit into early 2021, but the vote in May on the so-called Heroes Act was purely for show. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders knew the bill would go nowhere given Republican opposition. The vote allowed them to proclaim their sympathy with struggling workers at zero cost.

The 18 days until the cutoff will be consumed by backroom horse-trading between the House Democrats, the Senate Republicans and the White House, with all factions vying for the support of Wall Street and big business.

Since the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the response of all factions of the US ruling establishment has been to prioritize support for Wall Street. After enacting a multitrillion-dollar bailout of the big corporations, they soon dropped efforts to contain the pandemic as well as measures to further ameliorate its economic impact on workers.

The end of the federal $600 unemployment supplement would plunge millions of families overnight into poverty, under conditions where there are 19.3 million people drawing jobless benefits, compared to just 1.7 million in early March. That number is three times higher than the peak during the 2008-2009 Great Recession.

Jobless benefits vary widely state by state, but generally provide only a fraction of prior wages. In Florida, for example, the maximum weekly benefit is a starvation level $275.

More than one million new claims for unemployment have been filed in each of the past 16 weeks, another staggering number that speaks to the depth of the economic catastrophe engulfing the US.

Adding to the hardship, food prices are rising at the fastest rate in 50 years. The Consumer Price Index for food is up 3.4 percent and accelerating, but it is much higher for staple goods like canned food and pasta.

Perhaps the most immediate threat to large numbers of working class families hit hard by unemployment is that they have been unable to make rent payments in April, May and June, and now face the threat of imminent eviction and homelessness. A similar situation confronts millions of homeowners who face foreclosure.

The COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project based in Colorado warned that 20 percent of the 110 million renters in the US are at risk of eviction by September 30, some 500,000 in the state of Colorado alone.

Breonne DeDecker, a housing rights advocate in New Orleans, warned, “Extra unemployment is going to expire, and the CARES Act protections are going to expire, and we are going to see a huge public health and housing crisis the likes we haven’t seen since immediately post Katrina.” DeDecker added, “Ultimately, reopening eviction court without ensuring that tenants can actually deal with their accumulated rent debts is a disaster.”

Eviction filings through June 27 were up 13 percent compared with previous years in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The state lifted a foreclosure moratorium in late May.

An eviction moratorium in Pennsylvania expires July 10 and the one in Michigan expires July 15. In Arizona, currently the site of a major coronavirus resurgence, the statewide ban on evictions expires July 22.

Pennsylvania housing advocates expect a surge of evictions when the moratorium expires. Kenneth Pick, executive director of the Berks County redevelopment authority in the city of Reading, warned that the end of the moratorium could lead to a surge in evictions and a potential homelessness crisis.

“We think there will be a considerably large number of people facing eviction when the moratorium is finally lifted,” he said, adding that the numbers still were not clear. “No one has been able to figure it out because no one has been able to file evictions.”

A study by the Urban Institute estimated that there were 8.9 million renter households where at least one person lost a job between February and April. Many of these households were already in precarious financial straits and could face eviction once moratoriums end.

The economic fallout from the pandemic has been especially severe for immigrant workers, who are not eligible for unemployment benefits and may fear to challenge evictions due to their immigration status.

The threat of mass impoverishment for millions of unemployed workers takes place under conditions of rising social anger expressed in the mass protests over police violence and job actions by autoworkers, nurses and other sections of workers over lack of protection from the spread of COVID-19.

This poses the necessity for the working class to establish its political independence from the parties of big business and advance a socialist program directed against the capitalist system, whose only solution to the mounting crisis is war and social reaction. No progressive resolution to the present crisis is possible except by breaking the stranglehold of Wall Street over economic and political life."
America is Having the Mother of All Social Collapses,https://eand.co/america-is-having-the-mother-of-all-social-collapses-1cac9aac0d17,"It’s genuinely terrifying to be an American these days. And a baffled world is looking on in horror, shuddering and wondering: “What the? What have Americans let happen to their society? What if that happens here?”

What is “that,” exactly?

America is having is the Mother of All Social Collapses. It’s hard to put into words because it really is something strange, new, unprecedented, shocking, gruesome. It’s like a major earthquake — it’s going to redefine the world’s fault lines for generations to come.

I say that because Trump’s America, I noticed, was trending on Twitter. In response, people had written all kinds of funny, snarky, depressing, angry rejoinders.

But it seemed impossible, maybe, to encapsulate it all. The scale and scope of what America’s become, the bottomless depth and towering height of the failure of a society like this.

Trump’s America is many things. Even I struggle to express the extent of the calamity in words by now. It’s a place where mass death is an everyday affair. Trump’s America is a plague state, wracked by illness and disease. Trump’s America is an economic trainwreck. It’s a society whose social bonds have been blown apart by hate and brutality and selfishness. It’s a budding police state — those “federal agents” are coming to your streets. It’s a collapsing nation — one imploding into authoritarianism, poverty, disease, and death.

Like I said, even I struggle to put it into words.

But the economist in me can express it much more succinctly and precisely.

When I say “The Mother of All Social Collapses,” I mean it. Trump’s America is a society that combines all the strands of social collapse that we know if — and then some. Yes, really.

Economically, Trump’s America is Soviet. Politically and socially, it resembles Nazi Germany. And culturally, it’s Taliban-esque, aggressively retrograde. That’s a lot of ruin for one country, which is why it’s so hard to put into words. It really is breathtaking and staggering when you think about it.

Let me begin with the economy — how Trump’s America is Soviet.

Its intellectual class seems incapable of processing much, or even any, of the above. As long as billionaires are getting richer, and the stock market’s rising — what’s the problem? Like the Soviet Union, America has a strange set of measures for the health and prosperity of a society, which don’t seem to account for anything that actually matters, whether happiness, wealth, stability, safety, or sanity. And like the Soviet Union, only paying attention to those self-created indicators of a kind of ideologically self-defined success has made America incapable of grasping the tiniest shreds of truth, like the fact that American life sucks for most people now.

Like the Soviet Union, Trump’s America is a place that can’t provide the basics for people anymore. Like decent jobs — 50% of Americans now work “low wage service jobs,” which is today’s jargon for: the menial work of servants to the rich. Like the basic good of public health — America has the world’s worst Coronavirus outbreak by a very long way, and it’s probably not going away…ever. Like decent food or water, which, if you’ve lived in Europe or Canada, are of a whole different league. Like public safety — think of how many kids get shot at school, or how many women and minorities get abused at work. Like money — 80% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Like hope and optimism for the future, which keeps a society confident, buoyant, gentle, working together — Americans now expect life to get steadily worse. They’re probably right. America can’t provide the most basic of basics for people anymore, from medicine to money to jobs to public health to safety. There’s no deeper way in which a society can fail.

Wait, let me correct that. There is one deeper way. The lights can go out. A society can turn dark.

That brings me to the next thing Trump’s America is. It’s also pretty, well, Nazi. Yes, Nazi. Look, before you react angrily to that, sputtering into denial let me say one thing: the entire world thinks this. I’m only sharing with you you what every single person who’s not American says to me every single goddamned day. From my friend Ben the grizzled London copper to my friend Art in Hong Kong to all my friends in Canada, Europe, and Africa. It’s the very first topic of discussion I have with a baffled and horrified world. Americans are the only ones who are still in denial about it.

Trump’s America is pretty Nazi. Come on — it’s not exactly hard to see. Concentration camps, kids in them, kids in cages in them, family separations, raids, bans, purges, hate, dehumanization, and so on. Who else does that? Accountants? Sure, sometimes, but when they do, they’ve become…Nazis.

We’re all taught about Nazism over and over again from the time we’re little kids, over and over again, so that it sinks into us. But while the entire world is now like “Wow, America turned kind of Nazi, huh?” by and large, within America, that’s still somehow a controversial proposition. You get the blank look from Americans when you say the word fascism — the one that everyone who’s not American knows, when the mind shuts down, when a truth too dangerous to utter has been spoken. Of course, that’s also fascism.

Trump’s America is a place where the denial of the good people runs rampant. Nazis? What Nazis? Where? Denial is a crucial element is a society turning politically Nazi. When I say “America resembles Nazi Germany politically and socially,” I don’t just mean the Trumpists — I also mean the regular old American who’s the only person left on planet earth who’s still in denial about it, like the good German of the 1930s.

What Americans didn’t seem to understand is that these Nazi institutions would soon be used against them, too, if they didn’t speak up against them. And now here we are — where the shock troops who once hunted hated immigrants are now beating and abducting American Moms off the streets, and gassing Mayors of Cities. That’s what denial does: it enables.

What happened in Nazi Germany was what political scientists politely call a “silent majority.” Today, America has one. And for some baffling reason, Americans seem to think a silent majority is a good thing. That a polite majority who say nothing is proof of some kind of civilized nature. Nothing could be more wrong. “Silent majority” is not a compliment. It’s an insult! It’s a disappointment, a condemnation. You don’t want a silent majority in a society. A silent majority paves the way for every kind of authoritarian implosion under the sun, from fascist to theocratic to kleptocratic to all of them put together.

In the Islamic World, the silent majority is what let the fundamentalists and fanatics take over, and wreck societies that were once democracies. In Nazi Germany, the silent majority is what let the Nazis seize power, and then abuse it. In the Soviet Union, the silent majority is what let the communist machine wreck everyday life and society.

Let me say it again, because I think it’s important. Americans seem to have been taught that a silent majority is a wonderful and noble thing, like some kind of sleeping dragon, who’ll suddenly awaken, and defend the land from the barbarians. It’s not. A silent majority is not a good thing for a society to have. It’s a terrible one. It’s a patient on life support having a stroke.

It’s what we call that part of a society who is too scared, frightened, weary, or willfully ignorant to live up to their responsibilities as citizens of a democracy.

A silent majority is a bad thing, not a good one. It’s a negative. It’s not a sleeping dragon, it’s more like one that’s passed out, drunk, while the barbarians set fire to the citadel. It’s a sign that a society has one of the final elements necessary to implode, which is…acquiescence, cowardice, or indifference, or maybe all three.

That brings me to the next thing Trump’s America is. Fanatical. While the good people are a silent majority — and again, that’s not a good thing — the American Idiot apparently wants to make America look, ironically, a lot like the Islamic world he purportedly hates. The American Idiot has flourished into a kind of weird Taliban of its own, demanding everything from control over women’s bodies to refusing vaccinations to not teaching kids science.

Nowhere else in the civilized world can you go and find the kinds of bizarre “debates” you do in America — over things for which there really is no debate. Should people wear masks? Does evolution exist? Should women not be objects and possessions? Are minorities human beings? Is it OK for a society to be a place of constant abuse, cruelty, aggression, and violence? Should people have no healthcare? How about kids — should we teach them superstition, not science, and then arm their teachers, in case a mass murderer shows up?

What the?

Americans don’t quite get it, but nowhere else in the world is like this. The closest analogue I have is the Islamic world, where people also tend to debate poppycock and superstition intensely and seriously, as though teaching a kid that human beings evolved was somehow going to seal their fate in the afterlife. But even in the Islamic world, America’s levels of everyday cruelty and aggression are hard to find — kids there aren’t getting shot at schools, they’re just getting turned into idiots.

The American Idiot has turned America into a society where idiocy of every kind flourishes. That’s how the Islamic World imploded, too, by the way. It wasn’t always like this — despite what you’ve heard. It used to be a literate, civilized, artistic, learned place. Then the mullahs arrived, the majorities fell silent — and the rest is history.

The American Idiot’s story is much the same. He’s pushed a kind of line of incredible cultural idiocy that rotted and broke the American Mind. Science was replaced with superstition, human decency with aggression, thoughtfulness with unthinking cruelty, knowledge with the ignorances of racism, misogyny, hate, and greed. Trump’s election was the triumph of the American Idiot, and since then, stunning leaps in idiocy have been made.

Because the American Idiot has successfully made every kind of superstition and regression into a “debate,” the result is that American can’t…go anywhere. It’s so busy trying to debate the American Idiot that it doesn’t have time or energy left to learn. From a world that is now far more successful. Why is it that Europeans enjoy such vastly higher standards of living? Why don’t they have to choose between their lives and their life savings? Why is it that Canadians have good healthcare and decent pensions? But when you’re busy “debating” whether, say, teachers should be armed or whether that secret police abducting moms and gassing mayors really is one…where can you go? Not forwards — only less backwards.

It feels frightening and surreal to live in Trump’s America these days for a good reason. Because it is. America is having the Mother of All Social Collapses.

Call it the MASC if you want an (unintentionally ironic) acronym.

The social collapse Trump’s America is having is a supercollapse. It combines the worst elements of all the social collapses that we know of. Hence, the Mother of All Social Collapses.

Economically, America is a weird mirror image of the Soviet Union — a society that’s unable to provide basics for its citizens anymore, leaving them to battle each other for whatever morsels of a decent life they can, in a perpetual, daily, desperate, bitter battle for survival. Just like in the Soviet Union, negligence and irresponsibility has led to economic stagnation, the implosion of the middle and working classes into mass poverty and mass hopelessness…and now, finally, to mass death.

Politically, America resembles Nazi Germany — right down to the silent majority, not just the concentration camps and secret police. The silence of that majority baffles the world — while Americans seem to think a silent majority is a good thing.

Culturally, America is a cousin of the Islamic World, where crackpots and theocrats want to organize a nation as a crusade for salvation, not as a modern, functioning society, where an Army of Idiots that’s an overly powerful minority has rendered any kind of social progress flatly impossible.

America’s collapse is a real one, and a special one. It isn’t just a Nazi collapse. It isn’t just an authoritarian collapse. It isn’t just an economic collapse. It isn’t even just a cultural collapse into hate and backwardness and superstition. It’s all those things put together.

The world hasn’t really seen all that put together before. The Soviet Union didn’t want to be a theocracy, and neither did the Nazis. The mullahs of the Islamic World wanted to provide basics for all — they weren’t capitalists — mistaken as they were as to how go about it. And so on. America combines all the strands of social collapse that we know of, and then adds some of its own — like the idiocy of the non-mask-wearer or the anti-vaxxer or the Fox News addict.

It’s honestly terrifying to be American these days. The world is closing its doors to us. The bodies are piling up. You can’t have a decent life, it seems, no matter how hard you work — you’ll never pay off those “debts.” There’s an Army of Idiots, led by a Psychopath-in-Chief, who think being able to carry a gun to Starbucks is a basic human right — but healthcare isn’t. Where will you go? What will you do?

Welcome to Trump’s America.

You’re living through the Mother of All Social Collapses. It might just last another four years —but if you don’t do something, it might last for much longer still.

"The world's oceans are struggling to breathe, rapidly running out of oxygen at an unprecedented rate. Climate change is dangerously exacerbating the issue, scientists warned in a new study.",https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/worlds-oceans-are-losing-oxygen-at-a-dangerous-unprecedented-rate-as-temperatures-rise/,"The world's oceans are struggling to breathe, rapidly running out of oxygen at an unprecedented rate. Climate change is dangerously exacerbating the issue, scientists warned in a new study.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) released the largest report of its kind — combining the efforts of 67 scientists from 17 countries — at the global climate summit in Madrid on Saturday. It found that the oxygen level of the ocean has declined by about 2% since the 1950s, and the volume of water completely depleted of oxygen has quadrupled since the 1960s.

Sixty years ago, only 45 ocean sites suffered from low oxygen levels. That number skyrocketed to 700 in 2011. According to the study, about 50% of oxygen loss in the upper part of the ocean is a result of temperature increase.

""With this report, the scale of damage climate change is wreaking upon the ocean comes into stark focus,"" Dr. Grethel Aguilar, IUCN acting director general, said in a statement. ""As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray.""

Deoxygenation will adversely impact food security and human populations all over the world. IUCN

A combination of climate change and increased nutrient discharge will cause a 3%-4% decrease in ocean oxygen levels on average by 2100 if business continues as usual, scientists predict.

""This is perhaps the ultimate wake-up call from the uncontrolled experiment humanity is unleashing on the world's ocean as carbon emissions continue to increase,"" said Dan Laffoley, Senior Advisor Marine Science and Conservation in IUCN's Global Marine and Polar Program and a co-editor of the report.

Researchers named 2 major causes of deoxygenation

Ocean deoxygenation has a wide range of consequences on marine biodiversity and the everyday functioning of ocean ecosystems.

""Whilst we have known about dead zones in the ocean for many decades, ocean warming is now expected to further amplify deoxygenation across great swathes of the ocean,"" said Isabella Lövin, Minister for Environment and Energy and Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, a major funder of the report. ""With this report it is time to put ocean deoxygenation among our top priorities in order to restore ocean health.""

Reductions in oxygen levels in the ocean can cause stress in marine organisms, depriving them of the necessary oxygen supply. According to researchers, deoxygenation is threatening larger species including tuna, marlin, swordfish and sharks.

Larger marine animals are swimming closer to the surface, where oxygen is more available, but this leaves them prone to overfishing. Hundreds of millions of people who rely on fishing for their food and livelihood may be affected as they struggle to adapt.

According to researchers, deoxygenation is threatening species including tuna, marlin, swordfish and sharks. IUCN

""If we run out of oxygen it will mean habitat loss and biodiversity loss and a slippery slope down to slime and more jellyfish,"" said IUCN Global Marine and Polar Programme director Minna Epps. ""It will also change the energy and the biochemical cycling in the oceans and we don't know what these biological and chemical shifts in the oceans can actually do.""

In addition to the socioeconomic impacts on humans, deoxygenated waters produce greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, that are eventually released into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2018, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

In order to fix the issue of deoxygenation, scientists say humans must quickly tackle the climate crisis globally, as well as nutrient pollution at the local level through legislation to reduce runoff. Scientists warn that warming-driven deoxygenation cannot easily be reversed, but it can be slowed by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The report was released during COP25 because world leaders are crucial to changing outcomes for the oceans.

""Urgent global action to overcome and reverse the effects of ocean deoxygenation is needed,"" Epps said. ""Decisions taken at the ongoing climate conference will determine whether our ocean continues to sustain a rich variety of life, or whether habitable, oxygen-rich marine areas are increasingly, progressively and irrevocably lost."""
"Low-Wage Jobs are the New American Normal: Low-wage workers make up nearly half of the American workforce, and many of them are the sole breadwinners for their families.",https://www.legalreader.com/low-wage-jobs-are-the-new-american-normal/,"Low-wage workers make up nearly half of the American workforce, and many of them are the sole breadwinners for their families.

Last November, the Brookings Institution released a study concluding that nearly half of working age Americans are employed in low-wage jobs. They found that 53 million Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 earned a median wage of $10.22 per hour, or $18,000 per year.

The fact that 44% of the American workforce now finds itself in such a precarious economic situation might come as a surprise to those who imagine low-wage work to be the domain of teenagers, college students, the newly-hired, or those taking on side gigs for extra cash. Instead, these jobs are the main way that many people support their families, especially in smaller cities in the southern and western regions of the United States. 26% of low-wage earners are the sole breadwinners for their household, and another 25% live in households where all earners work in low-paying jobs.

Perhaps the most obvious solution to improving conditions for these workers is to provide education, retraining, and skill upgrades so that they qualify for better jobs. Indeed, 40% of low-wage workers between the ages of 25-64 have, at most, a high school diploma, while another 13% are young people without degrees who are not in school. That means, however, that nearly half of the workers in low-paying jobs already have higher levels of educational attainment.

Simply getting more education won’t cause jobs to magically appear, either. The Occupy movement was full of college-educated people who couldn’t find sufficient jobs to pay back crushing student debt. Perhaps it’s true that “they should have gotten STEM degrees,” (and not those pesky Women’s Studies or sociology majors) as those on the Libertarian/Conservative spectrum self-righteously preached in 2011, but remember how that sentiment morphed into right-wing trolls mocking laid-off “elite” journalists with the condescending mantra of “better learn to code, then” by 2019? (Besides, if everyone learned to code, it would become just another low-wage job.)

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren’s efforts to level the playing field by making education more attainable for those lower on the economic spectrum are decried as unfair by conservatives, while President Trump compares himself to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for the “blowout” economy that’s adding mostly low-wage jobs. (Yay?) With wages falling, even the military, traditionally a way for underprivileged young people to work their way up, is now considered to make too much money relative to civilian pay. (Perhaps what this really means is that civilians make too little, relative to military pay, but nobody looks at it that way.)

It’s clear that the existence of the middle class was a historic anomaly. In 2017, MIT economist Peter Temin argued that we’re splitting into a two-class system. There’s a small upper class, about 20% of Americans, predominantly white, degree holders, working largely in the technology and finance sectors, that holds the lion’s share of wealth and political power in the country. Then, there’s a much larger precariat below them, “minority-heavy” but still mostly white, with little power and low-wage, if any, jobs. Escaping lower-class poverty depends upon navigating two flawless, problem-free decades, starting in early childhood, ending with a valuable college degree. The chances of this happening for many are slim, while implementing it stresses kids out and even makes them meaner. Fail, and you risk “shit-life syndrome” and a homeless retirement.

There may not be any good answers. The same eternal growth that would be necessary to constantly increase living standards for everyone is the same consumption that is burning the planet and coating it in carbon and plastic. The Right’s answer is that people should bootstrap themselves up a playing field so uneven that it may as well be vertical. The Left’s answer is to soak the rich, but wealth redistribution can only substitute for growth for a while, and it doesn’t solve the root cause of the problem.

Polluted air killing half a million babies a year across globe,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/21/polluted-air-killing-half-a-million-babies-a-year-across-globe,"State of Global Air report says indoor air quality causing two-thirds of the deaths and affecting health in the womb

Air pollution last year caused the premature death of nearly half a million babies in their first month of life, with most of the infants being in the developing world, data shows.

Exposure to airborne pollutants is harmful also for babies in the womb. It can cause a premature birth or low birth weight. Both of these factors are associated with higher infant mortality.

Nearly two-thirds of the 500,000 deaths of infants documented were associated with indoor air pollution, particularly arising from solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking.

The discovery is reported in the State of Global Air 2020 report, which examined data on deaths around the world alongside a growing body of research that links air pollution with health problems.

Medical experts have warned for years of the impacts of dirty air on older people and on those with health conditions, but are only beginning to understand the deadly toll on babies in the womb.

Katherine Walker, principal scientist at the Health Effects Institute, which published the report, said: “We don’t totally understand what the mechanisms are at this stage, but there is something going on that is causing reductions in baby growth and ultimately birth weight. There is an epidemiological link, shown across multiple countries in multiple studies.”

Babies born with a low birth weight are more susceptible to childhood infections and pneumonia. The lungs of pre-term babies can also not be fully developed.

“They are born into a high pollution environment, and are more susceptible than children who went to term,” said Dan Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute in the US.

Beate Ritz, professor of epidemiology at UCLA, (University of California, Los Angeles), who was not involved with the study, said the indoor air pollution in cities across India, south-east Asia and Africa was comparable to that of Victorian London.

“This is not the air pollution we see in modern cities [in the rich world] but that which we had 150 years ago in London and other places, where there were coal fires indoors. Indoor air pollution has not been at the forefront for policymakers, but it should be,” Ritz said.

She pointed out that the harm to children went beyond the deaths; reducing air pollution would also lessen harm to survivors. “There is also damage to the brain and other organs from this pollution, so just surviving is not enough – we need to reduce air pollution because of the impact on all these organs too,” she said.

Some of these effects are likely to have existed, unnoticed, for centuries, as people have long cooked upon fires in enclosed spaces, an activity that causes particulate matter to be breathed in, particularly by women and children, who spend more time in the home.

However, the problem is now compounded by the population density of many developing cities and by outdoor air pollution from vehicles and industry. These factors mean there is now no escape from dirty air, from morning to night, for hundreds of millions of people.

The report concentrates on data from 2019, so does not include the impacts of the lockdown policies around the world in 2020. The authors said the Covid-19 pandemic would have had an impact on air quality and deaths from air pollution, but these effects were not yet clear.

Greenbaum said the likelihood of any long-term beneficial impact to health from the temporary reductions in air pollution because of lockdowns was small, but that the sudden clearing of pollution from traffic and industry had changed many people’s perception of air quality.

“People all of a sudden realised what it is like to have beautiful blue skies on a regular basis. Even if it did not last it showed what was possible,” Greenbaum said.

Some studies have suggested that people exposed to air pollution could have a higher risk of death from Covid-19, but these are early findings. Greenbaum said more work was needed to establish what difference was made by exposure to air pollution.

The scientists said there had been little sign of improvement in air pollution over the past 10 years, despite increased warnings over the risks from dirty air in the past five years.

At least 6.7 million deaths globally in 2019 were from long-term exposure to air pollution, a factor raising the risk of stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer and other chronic lung diseases. Air pollution is now the fourth highest cause of death globally, just below smoking and poor diet.

The State of Global Air Report 2020 is published by the Health Effects Institute, which is an independent nonprofit research organisation funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency and others."
"Pulitzer winner Chris Hedges: These ""are the good times — compared to what's coming next""",https://www.salon.com/2020/04/28/pulitzer-winner-chris-hedges-these-are-the-good-times--compared-to-whats-coming-next/,"Empires fall a little bit at a time and then all at once. Over the last two decades, America has proven itself to be well along on that journey. The coronavirus pandemic has simply pushed our nation further along that downward spiral.

Ultimately, the pandemic has further exposed and exacerbated — for those still somehow in denial about the decades-long reality of America as a decaying empire — deep political, social, economic, cultural and other societal problems.

The country's infrastructure is rotting. Trump presides over a plutocratic, corrupt, cruel, authoritarian, pathological kakistocracy. The commons is being reduced to rubble while the ultra-rich extract ever more wealth and other resources from the American people. Excessive military spending has left the United States incapable of attending to the basic needs of its people. A culture of distraction and spectacle has rendered many Americans incapable of being responsible engaged citizens. Our public educational system does not teach critical thinking skills. Radical right-wing Christians, white terrorist organizations and other neofascist paramilitaries and extremists are engaging in a campaign of thuggery, intimidation and violence against multiracial American democracy.

Writing at the Atlantic, George Packer described this woeful state of affairs:

The crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational, and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus — like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering. The administration squandered two irretrievable months to prepare. From the president came willful blindness, scapegoating, boasts, and lies. From his mouthpieces, conspiracy theories and miracle cures. A few senators and corporate executives acted quickly — not to prevent the coming disaster, but to profit from it. When a government doctor tried to warn the public of the danger, the White House took the mic and politicized the message. Every morning in the endless month of March, Americans woke up to find themselves citizens of a failed state.

In the New York Times, Pulitzer-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen diagnosed the health of America's body politic in the age of Trump and the pandemic he has empowered and accelerated:

If anything good emerges out of this period, it might be an awakening to the pre-existing conditions of our body politic. We were not as healthy as we thought we were. The biological virus afflicting individuals is also a social virus. Its symptoms — inequality, callousness, selfishness and a profit motive that undervalues human life and overvalues commodities — were for too long masked by the hearty good cheer of American exceptionalism, the ruddiness of someone a few steps away from a heart attack.

Chris Hedges, the Pulitzer-winning journalist, author, and philosopher, is not surprised by America's decline. In places such as the former Yugoslavia, he has personally witnessed what happens when societies fall apart. In his most recent book, ""America: The Farewell Tour,"" Hedges both details the country's many cultural and political crises and what could potentially happen next. The coronavirus crisis has shown his analysis to be eerily prescient.

In this conversation, Hedges warns that the tumult and pain of Trump's coronavirus crisis is but a preview of far worse things in America's future, as social inequality and political failure combine to create a full collapse of the country's already declining standard of living, as well as its ailing democracy.

Hedges also explains how the Democratic Party and its presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, will likely not be able to respond to the Age of Trump and the economic and social destruction created by gangster capitalism, in combination with the coronavirus pandemic. Why? Because the Democrats are also part of the plutocratic establishment that has failed the American people.

What has the sudden shock of the coronavirus pandemic revealed about America? If you were to take a snapshot of this moment, what does it reveal about the country?

These days are the good times, as compared to what is coming next.

How does a society change so fast?

A society can change so quickly because the underlying structures are rotten. There is the patina or the veneer of a functioning system, but the foundations of it are so decayed that they can't take the stress. That was true in the Weimar Republic in Germany, before the Nazis took full control. That was true in Yugoslavia before the civil war and ethnic violence. It is true here in the United States too. This country cannot withstand the stress of the coronavirus pandemic. Beyond the obviousness of what the Republicans are doing, the Democratic Party's response to this crisis exemplifies the problems America is facing as a whole.

Twelve hundred dollars to individuals suffering during this crisis is not sufficient. The Democrats were only really trying to block the equivalent of a $500 billion slush fund that is going into Mnuchin's hands, a man who acts like a criminal. That $1,200 is going to get vacuumed right up by the credit card companies and the banks who hold the mortgages.

This is like a repeat of 2008, where Congress is dumping staggering sums of money into the hands of Wall Street thieves. What happened in 2008? The plutocrats and the corporations gave themselves massive stock bonuses and other income and returns. I do not see how the United States is going to avoid another Great Depression, which in turn will lead to a further consolidation of power by an authoritarian, oligarchic elite. Those elites are not really worried about the coronavirus pandemic because they will have their own ventilators and private medical staff and all the other things that they need to survive. The average person will be left to take care of themselves.

The president, his party, the corporate overlords and Trump's Christian nationalist cult are now telling the American people to go out and risk death from the novel coronavirus as an act of ""patriotism"" and ""love"" for the economy.

I would also add that huge numbers of people are going to die unnecessarily. Profit is always the most important thing for the oligarchs, and because of Fox News and other right-wing outlets a significant portion of the American public will downplay the severity and dangers of the coronavirus. Quite predictably, there is an accompanying spike in racist attacks against Chinese-Americans or any people of Asian descent.

I think the pandemic and the response to it could lead us into virtually uncharted territory within the United States because as things deteriorate, the violence against nonwhites and other groups who are demonized by Trump and the right wing will increase. The desire for an authoritarian solution will grow more pronounced. I remember speaking to Fritz Stern, the great scholar of fascism, who himself fled Nazi Germany as a teenager. He said that in Germany there was a yearning for fascism before the word ""fascism"" was invented. We already see that yearning in America. The coronavirus crisis will make that yearning even more pronounced.

What of public memory, especially in the short and the medium term? There are many voices who believe the coronavirus will spur positive social change in the United States. I worry that there will be a type of organized forgetting, where several months from now the coronavirus pandemic and what it exposed about the country's underlying rot will be forgotten — all of it thrown down the memory hole.

I don't think we're going to be able to go back to a time before the coronavirus pandemic. I believe that the coronavirus is going to trigger a decline unlike anything the country has seen since the Great Depression. That is why the business class and other ruling elites are panicking. It is why Trump, the corporate leaders, Republicans and others aligned with them are telling people to go back to work — but to wear masks — which may really not keep them 100% safe.

Advertisement:

The pandemic was predictable. And yet, of course, especially under the Trump administration, we dismantled the mechanisms through which the United States could prepare. The needed infrastructure, such as hospital beds and ventilators and other needed equipment, was not there because, like with all decaying empires, the resources go to the defense industry and the military.

The other part of this decay and vulnerability was the assault against public education and the corruption of the media. The fact that Fox News is even considered a news organization is staggering — although I don't think CNN is much better. In total, that contributes to a yearning for a system or a figure that can promise to tame the demons that have been unleashed.

I am unsure if we have any mechanisms left in the United States by which we can effectively push back against the elites, the oligarchs and other anti-democratic forces. We don't have any ability to pit power against power. We can beg Pelosi or Mitch McConnell or some other politician all we want for help. We are not going to get it.

Watching Trump stand before the country and speak about the coronavirus pandemic while he is flanked by corporate CEOs — never mind how Trump has filled the government with people from some of the world's largest corporations — really speaks to how the country is a naked plutocracy. The elites do not even try to hide it anymore.

The oligarchs don't care about democracy. They don't care about truth. They are not interested in the consent of the governed. They could care less about social and income inequality. They are not going to rein in the surveillance state. In fact, as things deteriorate, the surveillance state going to expand. The oligarchs do not care about job losses because, as Marx said, unemployment creates greater pools of desperate surplus labor. The oligarchs do not care about the climate. It's all about the primacy of profit and corporate power — and those values and systems are extinguishing our democracy.

And of course, they are all thrilled that nobody can go out in the streets because of the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing. Mass mobilization and civil disobedience is what is needed to defeat the oligarchs and take those first steps necessary to win back an American democracy.

America's current political system is a corporate political duopoly. A person can either vote for nativists and racists and climate deniers and creationists on one end, or a person can vote for people who speak in the language of tolerance and are willing to put gay people or women or people of color into positions of power as long as they serve the system. Of course, that is the role that Barack Obama fulfilled at the expense of the American people.

American society is in crisis, and in decline. As you point out, the coronavirus, in combination with Trump's authoritarian, neofascist movement are just symptoms of a deep societal rot. Where do we go from here?

Let's take Biden. What does it mean to vote for Joe Biden? He has this kind of goofy persona which some people find charming. What is Biden's record? What is a person voting for if they back Biden on Election Day 2020?

The humiliation of courageous women like Anita Hill who confronted her abuser. You vote for the architects of endless war. You vote for the apartheid state in Israel. Biden supports those things. With Biden you are voting for wholesale surveillance by the government, including the abolition of due process and habeas corpus. You vote for austerity programs. You vote for the destruction of welfare. That was Biden. You vote for cuts to Social Security, which he has repeatedly called for cutting, along with Medicaid. You vote for NAFTA, you vote for ""free trade"" deals. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for a real decline in wages and the loss of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs.

With Biden you are also voting for the assault on public education and the transfer of federal funds to Christian ""charter schools."" With Biden you are voting for more than a doubling of the prison population. With Biden you are voting for the militarized police and against the Green New Deal.

You are also voting to limit a woman's right to abortion and reproductive rights. You are voting for a segregated public school system. With Biden you are voting for punitive levels of student debt and the inability of people to free themselves of that debt through bankruptcy. A vote for Biden is a vote for deregulating banking and finance. Biden also supports for-profit insurance and pharmaceutical corporations.

A vote for Biden is also a vote against the possibility of universal health care. You vote for Biden and you are supporting huge, wasteful and bloated defense budgets. Biden also supports unlimited oligarchic and corporate money to buy the elections.

That's what you're voting for.

A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for more of the same. The ruling elites would prefer Joe Biden, just like they preferred Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump is vulgar and an embarrassment. But the ruling elites also made it abundantly clear about their interests: Many of these people were quoted by name saying that if Bernie Sanders was the nominee — or even Elizabeth Warren — they would vote for Donald Trump.

One of the dominant narratives in the mainstream news media is that Trump is done. The coronavirus pandemic and his incompetence are dooming his re-election chances; the tide has finally turned.

My response has been that this is too hopeful and borders on the delusional. One, there is no guarantee that there will even be a presidential election in 2020. Trump and the Republican Party are experts at vote-rigging and other ways of cheating to steal elections and subvert democracy. After the coronavirus crisis recedes, I believe that Trump may very well be even more powerful because he leads a cult and will proclaim that he led the country to ""victory"" over the virus.

Liberal elites offer hope that is not grounded in an understanding of political reality. I do not believe that Joe Biden will necessarily be able to win against Trump. Biden is an extremely weak candidate because he represents the neoliberal gangster capitalist policies that the Democratic Party has embraced and that so many Americans are revolting against.

James Baldwin explained why black people don't have midlife crises. Why? Because they do not buy into the myths of America. Black people know that the system in America is rigged. Black people know this when they are children. By comparison, white people buy into these illusions of meritocracy and individualism and American exceptionalism and similar beliefs. That is why the highest rates of suicide right now are among middle-aged white men, because they are finally starting to realize that the system does not care about them."

"The Pentagon warned the White House about a shortage of ventilators, face masks, and hospital beds in 2017",https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/covid-military-shortage-pandemic/,"EDITOR’S NOTE: The Nation believes that helping readers stay informed about the impact of the coronavirus crisis is a form of public service. For that reason, this article, and all of our coronavirus coverage, is now free. Please subscribe to support our writers and staff, and stay healthy.

Despite President Trump’s repeated assertions that the Covid-19 epidemic was “unforeseen” and “came out of nowhere,” the Pentagon was not just well aware of the threat of a novel influenza but even anticipated the consequent scarcity of ventilators, face masks, and hospital beds, according to a 2017 Pentagon plan obtained by The Nation. Ad Policy

“The most likely and significant threat is a novel respiratory disease, particularly a novel influenza disease,” the military plan states. Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel (meaning new to humans) coronavirus. The document specifically refers to coronaviruses on several occasions, in one instance saying, “Coronavirus infections [are] common around the world.”

The plan updates an earlier Department of Defense pandemic influenza response plan, noting that it “incorporates insights from several recent outbreaks including…2012 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.”

Titled “USNORTHCOM Branch Plan 3560: Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Disease Response,” the draft plan is marked for official use only and dated January 6, 2017. The plan was provided to The Nation by a Pentagon official who requested anonymity to avoid professional reprisal.

Denis Kaufman, who served as head of the Infectious Diseases and Countermeasures Division at the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2014 to 2017, stressed that US intelligence had been well aware of the dangers of coronaviruses for years. (He retired from his decades-long career in the military in December 2017.)

“The intelligence community has warned about the threat from highly pathogenic influenza viruses for two decades, at least. They have warned about coronaviruses for at least five years,” Kaufman said in an interview.

“There have been recent pronouncements that the coronavirus pandemic represents an intelligence failure…. It’s letting people who ignored intelligence warnings off the hook.”

In addition to anticipating the coronavirus pandemic, the military plan predicted with uncanny accuracy many of the medical supply shortages that will now apparently soon cause untold deaths.

The plan states, “Competition for, and scarcity of resources will include…non-pharmaceutical MCM [medical countermeasures] (e.g., ventilators, devices, personal protective equipment such as face masks and gloves), medical equipment, and logistical support. This will have a significant impact on the availability of the global workforce.”

The 103-page response plan provides an overview of what might cause a pandemic, likely complications, and how the military might respond. The plan outlines conditions under which an infectious disease can become a pandemic, several of which were at play with Covid-19: crowded workplaces, proximity to international airports, unsanitary living conditions. It also contains references to classified annexes that go into further detail. (The Nation is not in possession of these annexes.)

Last week, Trump lashed out at General Motors and Ford on Twitter, demanding that they manufacture ventilators, a life-or-death appliance for many people with acute Covid-19 symptoms.

General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!! @GeneralMotors @Ford —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2020



The plan’s warning about face masks and ventilators was prescient: The US Strategic National Stockpile of medical equipment—including respirators, gloves, face masks, and gowns—is reportedly nearly depleted.

The military plan also correctly anticipates “insufficient hospital beds.” Indeed, hospitals are in critically short supply in Italy and are rapidly filling up across New York.

“Even the most industrialized countries will have insufficient hospital beds, specialized equipment such as mechanical ventilators, and pharmaceuticals readily available to adequately treat their populations during clinically severe pandemic,” the report goes on.

Another prediction in the report anticipates worldwide competition for and scarcity of Covid-19 vaccines. Trump has already reportedly offered German scientists large sums of money for exclusive rights to a vaccine, and efforts to develop drugs are underway in several countries.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"CA Gov. Gavin Newsom: By this point last year, 4,292 fires had burned 56,000 acres. This year, 7,002 fires have chewed through more than 1.4 million acres.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/us/california-fires-wildfires.html?action=click&module=News&pgtype=Homepage,"FREMONT, Calif. — Residents of the San Francisco suburbs are packing emergency “go bags” and drawing up inventories of their belongings, dreading the idea that they might need proof for an insurance adjuster if their homes burn.

The pall of choking smoke outside their windows — four times worse than the air quality in Beijing or New Delhi on Monday morning — is a reminder that the wildfires ravaging large parts of Northern California are only a few canyons away.

This is the fourth consecutive year of major conflagrations in California, but this year they feel more inescapable, a ring of fire around the eight million people who live in cities arrayed around the Bay. There are fires sandwiching Silicon Valley, which on Monday was smothered by a sickly white haze. Wildfires are raging in the Salinas Valley to the south and in the wine country of Napa and Sonoma Counties to the north.

Exclusive Poll: 80% of Young Voters Think ‘Global Warming Is a Major Threat to Life as We Know It’,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xgqymn/exclusive-poll-80-of-young-voters-think-global-warming-is-a-major-threat-to-life-as-we-know-it,"President Donald Trump’s response to climate change may be, “I don’t believe it,” but a new poll shows just how dramatically out of step that leaves him with young Americans.

The poll, shared exclusively with VICE News, found that 80% of Generation Z and Millennials believe “global warming is a major threat to human life on earth as we know it,” according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors-Zogby Strategies National Youth Poll.

They also believe that state and local government should be doing something about it in the absence of federal government action.

“While the boomers are still trying to decide whether or not scientists can be trusted, our kids are saying, ‘Save the planet,’” said Shane Bemis, the Republican mayor of Gresham, Ore., who helped commission the poll. “For me, it's not a partisan issue and I could care less whether the Republican Party party is on it. I care about clean water, clean air and I care about my kids.”

Bemis, the co-chairman of the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ youth engagement efforts, said that despite climate denialism from Trump and much of the national Republican Party, these poll numbers help reinforce that the GOP will have to change to remain relevant.

He said he wants to stress that to his fellow mayors at a conference the group is holding in Washington, D.C., this weekend, where two former mayors who are running for president will speak: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

“It's no longer okay to be able to deny climate change. That makes no sense to anyone.”

“When all of this is done, whatever this is that we're in right now, all of these issues are going to have to be centered in both political parties,” he said. “It's no longer okay to be able to deny climate change. That makes no sense to anyone.”

The poll also found that a quarter of the respondents try to reduce their carbon footprint practically every day and 35% try to in major life decisions only. Still, 76% said their primary mode of transportation is an automobile.

Interestingly, the poll found that 58% of respondents agreed with the statement, “We are amidst a climatic crisis, and drastic times call for bold measures; such as the need for the U.S. government to repair and upgrade the energy infrastructure; require utilities to develop renewable energy, and require businesses to become carbon free in the next 20 or 30 years.”

Twenty-one percent responded that sweeping climate legislation would be “beyond the capability” of the U.S. government. The rest chose neither statement of said they were not sure.

Green new voters

Jeremy Zogby, a pollster at the firm that conducted the survey, said they did not ask about the term, “Green New Deal,” which has become politicized. But the survey showed that the actual tenets of the Green New Deal, championed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, are popular, namely upgrading energy infrastructure, requiring utilities to develop renewable energy, and mandating businesses to become carbon free.

“That's kind of … a green light to go forward with those kinds of measures,” he said. “They can propose something as drastic as the Green New Deal and get the support from this age cohort.”

The poll was conducted over email in early December and polled 1,000 18- to 29-year-old registered likely voters nationwide, randomly sampled from an Ohio-based email list provider.

These numbers on climate change are not exactly surprising to anyone who has seen how young the activists marching in the streets are. It’s also not a surprise that since young people seem to want drastic action to address climate change, a plurality supports a presidential candidate proposing sweeping plans on the issue.

A separate Forbes-Zogby poll found Sanders had the most support among 18- to 29-year-old likely voters, with 32% support among that electorate.

The poll shared with VICE News also found that gun violence is also a defining issue for Generation Z and Millennials and also dug into why. Twenty-nine percent say they have or a relative has been personally affected by gun violence—an answer that jumps to more than 40% when the respondent is African American or a self-identified progressive.

When asked to choose what policies would curb gun violence, 44% chose universal background checks, 33% chose red flag legislation, and three answers got 26% support: a federal assault weapons ban, a federal firearm registry and mandatory federal gun licenses.

More than half of respondents believe undocumented immigrants who have been granted legal protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program should be given legal status or a pathway to citizenship, while a similar number believe the border wall is a “signal that out government is turning hostile to immigrants and asylum seekers.”

The poll also presented some interest, if not disjointed, information about how young voters see their jobs prospects and the economy, which a plurality of 29% chose as the most critical issue affecting who they’ll vote for.

Forty-nine percent said they are optimistic about their job prospects in the future, but 30% said they are still in the headwinds of the 2008 financial crisis. Although 40% answered their parents left them a world that is worse off, 54% agreed they would be financially better off than their parents.. While 41% expect to be able to retire after age 65, 44% don’t believe Social Security will be available to them by that time.

“I think that is that youthful optimism that things are going to get better, and I think that that's probably what we're seeing, that dichotomy,” said Topeka, Kan., Mayor Michelle De La Isla, a Democrat who co-chairs the youth engagement effort with Bemis. “Here's the situation now, we still think that things may get better, but we see some challenges, but we'll make it happen.”

“But isn't that what teens and young people sound like?” she continued.

Oh and one more thing. Nineteen percent of respondents said they vape."
Feds say far-right group coordinated attack on Minneapolis police precinct during protest,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/522509-feds-say-far-right-group-coordinated-attack-on-minneapolis-police-precinct,"The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota on Friday announced that the FBI brought charges against a member of the far-right “Boogaloo Bois” group for organizing and participating in an effort to “incite a riot” outside a Minneapolis police precinct in May amid protests against the police killing of George Floyd.

According to the legal complaint filed Monday, Ivan Harrison Hunter, a 26-year-old from Boerne, Texas, who claims to be a member of the Boogaloo Bois, communicated with fellow members in late May ahead of a planned trip to Minneapolis as police had already started clashing with protesters in the city.

The documents claim that federal agents obtained a video from the evening of May 28 showing an individual walking up to the door of the Third Precinct in Minneapolis and firing 13 rounds from “what appears to be an AK-47 style semiautomatic rifle.”

Federal officials said the shooter can be seen in the footage walking up to the camera and high-fiving other individuals before shouting “Justice for Floyd!”

In the hours that followed, the police building was overrun by demonstrators and severely damaged by fire.

The federal affidavit includes screenshots from the referenced footage, in which the individual can be seen wearing a skull mask covering the lower half of his face, glasses, a baseball cap and tactical gear.

Federal officials wrote in the complaint that another individual charged in connection with the incident who is cooperating with authorities said Hunter was the one who fired shots outside the precinct, which authorities later corroborated with several social media posts.

Upon returning to Texas, Hunter made several posts about the event and on May 30, Hunter reportedly sent a message to another individual stating, ""I set fire to that precinct with the black community,"" followed by ""Minneapolis third precinct,” according to the legal documents.

On May 31, Hunter sent a message to another individual, saying, ""My mom would call the fbi if she knew what I do and at the level I'm at w[ith] it.""

Federal authorities launched investigations into the Boogaloo Bois in late May, and in early June the Austin Police Department conducted a traffic stop and Hunter, who was in the vehicle, had six loaded magazines for an AK-47 style assault rifle affixed to a tactical vest he was wearing.

Days later, federal authorities were made aware of Hunter’s affiliation with Boogaloo Bois member Steven Carrillo, who had been charged in the Northern District of California with the May 29 murder of a Federal Protective Service Officer in Oakland, Calif.

According to the press release from the U.S. attorney’s office, Hunter was arrested on Oct. 21 in San Antonio, Texas, and made his initial court appearance Thursday.

The charges come amid increased scrutiny of militia groups suspected of inciting chaos at recent protests calling for racial justice.

"100.4 degree Arctic temperature record confirmed as study suggests Earth is warmest in at least 12,000 years",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arctic-temperature-record-100-4-degrees-earth-warmest-12000-years/,"Less than two weeks ago, the small Siberian town of Verkhoyansk soared to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, appearing to break an all-time record for the Arctic and alarming meteorologists worldwide. Now that temperature record has been verified by Russia's state weather authority.

The confirmation came the same day a comprehensive new study was released suggesting that present-day global temperatures are the warmest they have been in at least 12,000 years, and possibly far longer. The study used a variety of geological clues and statistical analysis methods to reconstruct ancient temperature estimates.

In a press conference Tuesday, the head of science at Russia's Hydrometeorological Centre confirmed that the town of Verkhoyansk did indeed reach 100.4° F on June 20th. The official confirmation was requested by the World Meteorological Organization.

Writing on Twitter, the Russian state weather authority said: ""In Verkhoyansk from June 18 to June 28, 2020, the maximum temperature exceeded 86° F… with a peak on June 20 to 100.4°. June-2020 in Verkhoyansk...became the warmest in history.""

Ten days after that record was set, the heat wave still persists. On Tuesday, a town in the Sakha Republic, 450 miles north-northwest of Verkhoyansk, and also 450 miles north of the Arctic Circle steps from the Arctic Ocean's Laptev Sea, hit an astonishing 93 degrees Fahrenheit. That's 40 to 45 degrees above normal.

93 F right near the Arctic Ocean. That's 40+ degrees F above normal. https://t.co/oXB4Lw2gXu — Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) June 30, 2020

The record heat in parts of Siberia during the month of May was so remarkable that it reached five standard deviations from normal. In other words, if hypothetically you were able to live in that area for 100,000 years, statistically speaking you should only experience such an extreme period of temperatures one time. Climate change has now increased that chance.

Zack Labe, a postdoc in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University and an expert on Arctic climate, told CBS News that while he is concerned by the recent heat, he is more unnerved by its staying power. ""I am still much more alarmed by the persistence of the record warmth — since December 2019, western Siberia temperatures have averaged nearly 9°F above average (1981-2010), which is quite astounding.""

It's just... wow ---> Western Siberia temperature anomalies averaged since December. Quite the extreme event! [Data from @ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis] pic.twitter.com/ssAHCuBvRo — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) June 16, 2020

The extended Siberian heat wave is due to an usually persistent high pressure system, which more or less has remained stuck over Russia since December. And while it's not uncommon for patterns to set up shop for extended periods of time due to natural cycles, this tenacity is extraordinary, to say the least.

It's clear that human-caused climate change plays a significant role in boosting the intensity of heat waves. Simply put, as average temperatures increase, extreme heat days become even more prominent.

In the Arctic, this impact is heightened due to a loss of ice and snow which typically reflects sunlight back to space. The decline in ice means more light is absorbed by the darker ground, spiking warming. The longer the heat dome lasts, the more it feeds back on itself, intensifying the heat wave.

""This warming increases the risk of extreme Arctic heat waves, such as this one, and moving forward over the next few decades,"" says Labe.

There may be an additional impact from climate change. Dr. Michael Mann is arguably one of the world's most respected climate scientists. In 2018 he published a study about a summer phenomenon he calls quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) in which atmospheric waves and jet streams tend to slow down or even get stuck, leading to a blocked pattern. This effect is most pronounced with more warming.

Mann told CBS News that while there is no evidence available yet for this specific event, ""It is consistent with the overall phenomenon of more persistent extremes as a result of a slower, more meandering jet stream.""

For decades, the Arctic has been warming much faster than the rest of the globe. Experts have frequently described that imbalance by saying that the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the global average. But that is no longer accurate. Just days ago, Gavin Schmidt, the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, corrected the reference by providing evidence that the rate of Arctic warming is actually three times faster.

The Arctic warming is getting a lot of attention this week, but I keep seeing references to the warming being twice as fast as the global mean, and that's not right. It's more like 3 times the global mean. pic.twitter.com/n87VwaoQav — Gavin Schmidt (@ClimateOfGavin) June 26, 2020

The staggering pace of warming in the Arctic is causing systemic changes. Labe is amazed by the impact. ""In response to the recent heat wave, the extent of Arctic sea has dropped like a rock in the Laptev Sea and the entire Siberian coastline. In fact, Arctic sea ice extent is melting several weeks earlier than average in this region!""

#Arctic sea ice extent near Siberia remains well below any previous year in the satellite era record... pic.twitter.com/Bm85gWA0SJ — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) June 30, 2020

Over the coming week the core of the heat dome over Siberia is forecast to drift towards the North Pole, enhancing further melting. ""The upcoming pattern looks particularly hostile for areas closer to the central Arctic Ocean. This will contribute to the formation of melt ponds (water) overtop of the sea ice, which can accelerate declines in sea ice extent later in the summer,"" explains Labe.

Recent heat is by no means restricted to the Siberian Arctic. So far in 2020, three cities in South Florida, including Miami, have experienced 121 record warm temperatures and only one record cold reading. In central Canada, temperatures this week along the shores of Hudson Bay are maxing out in the 90s. And in Norway, due to a stretch of unusual warmth well into the 80s, people are skiing on glaciers in bathing suits.

None of this comes as a surprise to climate scientists who have been sounding the alarms about the impacts of global warming for decades. This has led to extensive efforts to study past climates in order to help put the current warming into context.

For the study released Tuesday, a team of scientists affiliated with an international paleoclimate collaboration called PAGES (Past Global Changes), analyzed data spanning thousands of years into the past. The team engaged in an extremely exhaustive process reconstructing a 12,000-year temperature record ending in 1950. For the period before modern thermometers, they relied on a variety of temperature estimates based on what scientists call proxy records — clues like fossils buried in sediments, such as shells and pollen, that reveal what climate conditions were like in the ancient past.

The record revealed that the warmest 200-year period before 1950 took place about 6,500 years ago, when global surface temperatures were approximately 1.25 degrees Fahrenheit above the baseline, which is the 19th century average. Since that high point 6,500 years ago, the record shows the globe was steadily cooling. But that all changed abruptly in the past 150 years when, in that short time, humans have more than reversed thousands of years of cooling. Now global temperatures have risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above that baseline, leading to the conclusion that Earth is currently warmer than that warm period 6,500 years ago.

Prior to the starting point of the study 12,000 years ago, the Earth was engulfed in an Ice Age. Therefore, one could infer that temperatures are warmer today than they have been since before that Ice Age began, about 120,000 years ago. However, the study's lead author, Dr. Darrell Kaufman, a paleoclimate data specialist from Northern Arizona University, said the data is not precise enough to know for certain.

This new study by Kaufman validates work on past temperature reconstructions, like the now famous ""hockey stick"" graphic from Dr. Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. The name of the graphic comes from its resemblance to a hockey stick showing a vertical leap in temperatures at the very end of the past 1,000-year temperature record. This new study shows that same effect is also apparent in both 2,000-year and 12,000-year time frames, as seen in the graphic below.

Kaufman et al., Nature Scientific Data

Mann said the new study lends even more evidence to how quickly humankind is reshaping Earth's climate.

He explained, ""The 'handle' of the hockey stick just gets longer and longer with each new study and indeed there is a hint that current warmth now might be unprecedented since at least the last interglacial period more than a hundred thousand years ago."""
"Overconsumption and growth economy key drivers of environmental crises - study | The researchers say that ""green"" or ""sustainable growth"" is a myth. ""As long as there is growth—both economically and in population—technology cannot keep up, the overall environmental impacts will only increase.""",https://phys.org/news/2020-06-overconsumption-growth-economy-key-drivers.html,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

A group of researchers, led by a UNSW sustainability scientist, have reviewed existing academic discussions on the link between wealth, economy and associated impacts, reaching a clear conclusion: technology will only get us so far when working towards sustainability—we need far-reaching lifestyle changes and different economic paradigms.

In their review, published today in Nature Communications and entitled Scientists' Warning on Affluence, the researchers have summarized the available evidence, identifying possible solution approaches.

""Recent scientists' warnings have done a great job at describing the many perils our natural world is facing through crises in climate, biodiversity and food systems, to name but a few,"" says lead author Professor Tommy Wiedmann from UNSW Engineering.

""However, none of these warnings has explicitly considered the role of growth-oriented economies and the pursuit of affluence. In our scientists' warning, we identify the underlying forces of overconsumption and spell out the measures that are needed to tackle the overwhelming 'power' of consumption and the economic growth paradigm—that's the gap we fill.

""The key conclusion from our review is that we cannot rely on technology alone to solve existential environmental problems—like climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution—but that we also have to change our affluent lifestyles and reduce overconsumption, in combination with structural change.""

During the past 40 years, worldwide wealth growth has continuously outpaced any efficiency gains.

""Technology can help us to consume more efficiently, i.e. to save energy and resources, but these technological improvements cannot keep pace with our ever-increasing levels of consumption,"" Prof Wiedmann says.

Reducing overconsumption in the world's richest

Co-author Julia Steinberger, Professor of Ecological Economics at the University of Leeds, says affluence is often portrayed as something to aspire to.

""But our paper has shown that it's actually dangerous and leads to planetary-scale destruction. To protect ourselves from the worsening climate crisis, we must reduce inequality and challenge the notion that riches, and those who possess them, are inherently good.""

In fact, the researchers say the world's affluent citizens are responsible for most environmental impacts and are central to any future prospect of retreating to safer conditions.

""Consumption of affluent households worldwide is by far the strongest determinant—and the strongest accelerator—of increased global environmental and social impacts,"" co-author Lorenz Keysser from ETH Zurich says.

""Current discussions on how to address the ecological crises within science, policy making and social movements need to recognize the responsibility of the most affluent for these crises.""

The researchers say overconsumption and affluence need to be addressed through lifestyle changes.

""It's hardly ever acknowledged, but any transition towards sustainability can only be effective if technological advancements are complemented by far-reaching lifestyle changes,"" says co-author Manfred Lenzen, Professor of Sustainability Research at the University of Sydney.

""I am often asked to explain this issue at social gatherings. Usually I say that what we see or associate with our current environmental issues (cars, power, planes) is just the tip of our personal iceberg. It's all the stuff we consume and the environmental destruction embodied in that stuff that forms the iceberg's submerged part. Unfortunately, once we understand this, the implications for our lifestyle are often so confronting that denial kicks in.""

No level of growth is sustainable

However, the scientists say responsibility for change doesn't just sit with individuals—broader structural changes are needed.

""Individuals' attempts at such lifestyle transitions may be doomed to fail, because existing societies, economies and cultures incentivise consumption expansion,"" Prof Wiedmann says.

A change in economic paradigms is therefore sorely needed.

""The structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies leads to decision makers being locked into bolstering economic growth, and inhibiting necessary societal changes,"" Prof Wiedmann says.

""So, we have to get away from our obsession with economic growth—we really need to start managing our economies in a way that protects our climate and natural resources, even if this means less, no or even negative growth.

""In Australia, this discussion isn't happening at all—economic growth is the one and only mantra preached by both main political parties. It's very different in New Zealand—their Wellbeing Budget 2019 is one example of how government investment can be directed in a more sustainable direction, by transforming the economy rather than growing it.""

The researchers say that ""green growth"" or ""sustainable growth"" is a myth.

""As long as there is growth—both economically and in population—technology cannot keep up with reducing impacts, the overall environmental impacts with only increase,"" Prof Wiedmann says.

One way to enforce these lifestyle changes could be to reduce overconsumption by the super-rich, e.g. through taxation policies.

""'Degrowth' proponents go a step further and suggest a more radical social change that leads away from capitalism to other forms of economic and social governance,"" Prof Wiedmann says.

""Policies may include, for example, eco-taxes, green investments, wealth redistribution through taxation and a maximum income, a guaranteed basic income and reduced working hours.""

Modeling an alternative future

Prof Wiedmann's team now wants to model scenarios for sustainable transformations—that means exploring different pathways of development with a computer model to see what we need to do to achieve the best possible outcome.

""We have already started doing this with a recent piece of research that showed a fairer, greener and more prosperous Australia is possible—so long as political leaders don't focus just on economic growth.

""We hope that this review shows a different perspective on what matters, and supports us in overcoming deeply entrenched views on how humans have to dominate nature, and on how our economies have to grow ever more. We can't keep behaving as if we had a spare planet available."""
A Texas hospital is so overrun with coronavirus cases that officials say it will send the patients least likely to survive home to die,https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-starr-county-hospital-forced-choose-who-sent-home-die-2020-7?amp,"A Texas county said it was forming a committee to decide which coronavirus patients were most likely to die and send them home to their families.

Starr County Memorial Hospital is overrun with coronavirus cases, and hospitals elsewhere in Texas and in nearby states are also full, officials said.

The county's health authority said the ""situation is desperate"" and ""there is nowhere to put these patients.""

He said that for some patients ""we believe they will be better taken care in the love of their own family and home rather than thousands of miles away dying alone.""

Starr County had successfully avoided a large outbreak in the pandemic's early days. Some officials said the Texas governor's decision to reopen the state was the reason for the surge.

A hospital in Starr County, Texas, is so overrun with coronavirus cases that officials there said it would choose which patients to use its resources on and send those most likely to die back home to their families.

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Dr. Jose Vasquez — the health authority for Starr County — said the county was creating guidelines to help health workers decide how to use resources on patients with the best chance of survival.

Vasquez added that a committee would decide which patients were most likely to die at Starr County Memorial Hospital — the only hospital in the county — and would send them home.

""The situation is desperate,"" he said Tuesday. ""We cannot continue functioning in the Starr County Memorial Hospital nor in our county in the way that things are going. The numbers are staggering.""

""There is nowhere to put these patients. The whole state of Texas and neighboring states have no ICU beds to spare for us,"" he said, Border Report reported.

The decision is reminiscent of the decisions made by doctors in Italy in March, when that country was being ravaged by the virus. They said they had to choose who to save because of limited resources.

Italy has since brought its outbreak under control.

Texas has become a coronavirus hotspot in recent weeks, with more than 331,000 cases and 4,700 deaths recorded.

Starr County had successfully fought the coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic.

But Vasquez said cases started to increase ""in an exponential and alarming way"" after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott decided to reopen the state from late April, CBS News reported.

Joel Villarreal, the mayor of Rio Grande City — one of the cities in Starr County — said, ""What we did here was a model for the rest of the nation to follow, but it was lost.""

Texas state data shows that the county, which has 64,000 residents, went from 642 coronavirus cases on July 1 to 1,519 cases on July 23.

Starr County Judge Eloy Vera issued an emergency stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus on Wednesday.

It said that people are ""ordered to shelter-at-home in their residence"" and that businesses are recommended and encouraged to suspend any activities that can't be done curbside, as a drive-thru, or as take-out.

Vera also wrote on the county's Facebook page on Thursday that the county was ""seeing the results of socialization during the 4th of July, vacations, and other social opportunities.""

""Unfortunately, Starr County Memorial Hospital has limited resources and our doctors are going to have to decide who receives treatment, and who is sent home to die by their loved ones,"" he said.

""This is what we did not want our community to experience.""

He urged people to stay home: ""We can turn this around in two weeks. WE CAN DO IT. STAY HOME as much as possible. God bless you."""
"The 3 most populous states are breaking coronavirus records, leading to fears of 'apocalyptic' surges",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html,"(CNN) The United States saw a record number of new coronavirus cases in a single day with 37,077 reported Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Coronavirus has infected more than 2.4 million people and killed over 124,000 in the United States.

Thursday's total eclipses the previous high on April 24, when 36,291 new coronavirus cases were reported across the country.

Meanwhile, as coronavirus numbers skyrocket, some states are holding back on easing restrictions. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott paused any further phases to reopen the state on Thursday and issued an order to ensure hospital beds be available for Covid-19 patients.

Abbott's moves came as his state, California and Florida -- the three-most populous -- set records for new coronavirus cases daily amid fears of ""apocalyptic"" surges in major Texas cities if the trend continues.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also indicated that his state would not be moving to relax present restrictions.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a budget emergency to free up $16 billion to fight the pandemic, according to a release from his office.

The state could pause further reopening of its economy -- and even ""toggle back"" -- if health officials continue to see increases in infections and hospitalizations, Newsom suggested at a press conference Thursday.

And the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the US has only counted about 10% of coronavirus infections. That might mean as many as 20 million Americans have been infected.

Officially, coronavirus has killed at least 122,481 people and infected more than 2.4 million nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University

Florida and Texas announced Wednesday that they had recorded more than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases the prior day, a new daily record. California reported more than 7,000 cases , obliterating a record hit a day earlier.

Hospitals in California have seen a 32% increase in patients with the coronavirus over the last 14-day period, reaching an all-time high since the pandemic began, Newsom said. The number of patients in intensive care units has reached a record high after increasing 19% over the last two weeks.

Florida passed 5,000 again on Thursday, according to new state data.

Florida, Texas and California account for 27.4% of the 328 million people living in the US, according to the latest US Census Bureau estimates

'A temporary pause,' Texas governor says

Abbott previously had said he wanted to move to the next phase and be fully opened by July 4.

""The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business,"" Abbott said in a release.

Earlier this month, he announced the state was moving into its Phase III, meaning most business could operate at up to 50% capacity.

He suspended all elective surgeries in hospitals in four counties that are home to the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin. The counties have had ""significant increases"" in Covid-19 hospitalizations, Abbott said.

Any procedure not immediately necessary to correct a serious medical condition or preserve a life will be postponed.

""As we work to contain this virus, I urge all Texans to do their part to help contain the spread by washing their hands regularly, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing,"" Abbott said in a statement.

In California, the budget has gone from a $21 billion surplus to a $54.3 billion deficit in a matter of months, decimated by the economic demands of the pandemic.

Newsom's proclamation clears the way for the legislature to use $16 billion rainy fund to respond to the pandemic. Expenditures include personal protective equipment, medical equipment, and services to protect vulnerable populations.

20 million might have been infected

The CDC has been looking at antibody tests done across the country to see how many people had past infections that were not diagnosed at the time, said director Dr. Robert Redfield. It is seeing many more cases than have been reported officially.

""A good rough estimate now is 10 to 1,"" Redfield told a media briefing.

This is partly because testing had been limited to people who were seriously ill and showing up in hospitals or nursing homes. But now, as more people are being tested, it is becoming clear that a large percentage of people did not have any symptoms, or mild symptoms, Redfield said.

Some states are extending restrictions

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said at a press conference he wouldn't talk much about ""gating criteria"" for lessening restrictions, saying ""Arizona is on pause.""

Arizona is seeing the highest number of new cases per capita of any state in the country. It's had more new cases per capita than any state has had besides New York or New Jersey, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.

""It's growing, and it's growing fast across all age groups and demographics,"" Ducey said.

The state has added about 2,700 new cases per day over the seven days that ended Tuesday. Adjusted for population, that's about 38 new cases per 100,000 people per day.

In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards issued a new proclamation extending the Phase 2 restrictions for another 28 days.

""Some in Louisiana may be done with Covid, but I promise you that Covid is not yet done with Louisiana,"" Edwards said. ""I especially want to call on the young people of our state, those ages 18 to 29, to take this illness seriously.""

DeSantis in Florida indicated that the state won't be changing restrictions anytime soon

""We are where we are,"" the governor said at a press conference. ""I didn't say we're going to go on to the next phase."" He added later: ""We never anticipated necessarily doing anything different, in terms of the next phase at this point.""

More cases attributed to multiple factors

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported the lowest number of hospitalizations, with 996 across the state, ""the lowest number since we started.""

Cuomo criticized others who ""played politics,"" opened their economies too early, and ""now are causing this nation great havoc.""

Several factors contribute to the rise in cases.

In California, the virus is spreading at private gatherings in homes, more young people are testing positive, and cases among the incarcerated are alarming.

Officials in various states are encouraging social distancing, wearing masks, and washing hands.

""Going out in public without a mask is like driving drunk,"" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University. ""If you don't get hurt. You might kill somebody else.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has attributed the rise to more testing but others say community transmission is playing a key role as the state reopens.

And it's not accurate to simply say that the increased infections is due to increased testing, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy at the University of Minnesota.

No clear connection to recent protests has been established, experts say.

Concern about cases in the younger population and those without symptoms

Younger people testing positive at a higher rate is a ""smoldering fire"" that will hit vulnerable populations, said Erin Bromage, a CNN medical analyst and a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.

Health experts didn't focus on younger people at the beginning of the pandemic because the priority was the older population and those with underlying health conditions who required hospitalization, Bromage said.

JUST WATCHED Thanking pandemic heroes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Thanking pandemic heroes 01:18

""We're now seeing what is really happening, which is those 18- to 44-year-olds are being affected at a really high rate. Their social networks, their employment, is allowing them to mix at a higher rate, and we're seeing the infection rate -- especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona -- just skyrocketing in that demographic,"" Bromage said.

Bromage explained that while younger people with Covid-19 are not ""as prone to severe disease as the elderly,"" they will still put this population at risk. ""That's when we end up with lots of sickness and lots of disease.""

Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people continue to be a challenge, two health experts told CNN's ""New Day.""

""We can't get ahead of the person who doesn't have symptoms and get them to quarantine,"" said Dr. David Persse, the public health authority at the Houston Health Department. ""They need to start wearing masks and social distancing all the time.""

Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said young people and those who either get milder disease from Covid-19 or who are asymptomatic need to know ""they could be just as responsible for spreading the virus as someone who's sneezing it across the room.""

States have responded to the threat of Covid-19 in jails and prisons with ""gross negligence,"" according to the ACLU and the Prison Policy Initiative. The organizations published a report Thursday on conditions for the incarcerated.

As of June 22, more than 570 incarcerated people in the US and more than 50 corrections officers have died due to Covid-19, the report said. Jails and prisons have become hotspots for new cases.

Numbers in Texas cities are rising

If the current Texas trajectory continues, Houston could be the hardest-hit city in the US with numbers rivaling those in Brazil. Infection numbers are also rising in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine.

""The big metro areas seem to be rising very quickly and some of the models are on the verge of being apocalyptic,"" Hotez told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

""I can't stress enough how concerned I am,"" Hotez told CNN's Jake Tapper.

""We're not seeing the deaths yet, but that will start,"" Hotez said. ""Those deaths will start to mount up, I would say, in a couple of weeks.""

Models show that Houston could have a four-fold increase in the number of daily cases by July 4, he said, adding that states need to act to stop community transmission.

""That is really worrisome and as those numbers rise, we're seeing commensurate increases in the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions,"" he said. ""You get to the point where you overwhelm ICUs and that's when the mortality goes up.""

Hotez is also a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology, and is working on a potential Covid-19 vaccine."
The US military is a bigger polluter than more than 100 countries combined,https://qz.com/1655268/us-military-is-a-bigger-polluter-than-140-countries-combined/,"The US military’s carbon bootprint is enormous. Like corporate supply chains, it relies upon an extensive global network of container ships, trucks, and cargo planes to supply its operations with everything from bombs to humanitarian aid and hydrocarbon fuels. Our new study calculated the contribution of this vast infrastructure to climate change.

Greenhouse gas emission accounting usually focuses on how much energy and fuel civilians use. But recent work, including our own, shows that the US military is one of the largest polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries. If the US military were a country, its fuel usage alone would make it the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, sitting between Peru and Portugal.

In 2017, the US military bought about 269,230 barrels of oil a day and emitted more than 25,000 kilotons of carbon dioxide by burning those fuels. The US Air Force purchased $4.9 billion worth of fuel, and the Navy $2.8 billion, followed by the Army at $947 million and the Marines at $36 million.

It’s no coincidence that US military emissions tend to be overlooked in climate change studies. It’s very difficult to get consistent data from the Pentagon and across US government departments. In fact, the United States insisted on an exemption for reporting military emissions in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. This loophole was closed by the Paris Accord, but with the Trump administration due to withdraw from the accord in 2020, this gap will will return.

Our study is based on data retrieved from multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to the US Defense Logistics Agency, the massive bureaucratic agency tasked with managing the US military’s supply chains, including its hydrocarbon fuel purchases and distribution.

The US military has long understood that it isn’t immune from the potential consequences of climate change—recognizing it as a “threat multiplier” that can exacerbate other risks. Many, though not all, military bases have been preparing for climate change impacts like sea level rise. Nor has the military ignored its own contribution to the problem. As we have previously shown, the military has invested in developing alternative energy sources like biofuels, but these comprise only a tiny fraction of spending on fuels.

The American military’s climate policy remains contradictory. There have been attempts to “green” aspects of its operations by increasing renewable electricity generation on bases, but it remains the single largest institutional consumer of hydrocarbons in the world. It has also locked itself into hydrocarbon-based weapons systems for years to come, by depending on existing aircraft and warships for open-ended operations.

Not green, but less, military

Climate change has become a hot-button topic on the campaign trail for the 2020 presidential election. Leading Democratic candidates, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, and members of Congress like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are calling for major climate initiatives like the Green New Deal. For any of that to be effective, the US military’s carbon bootprint must be addressed in domestic policy and international climate treaties.

Our study shows that action on climate change demands shuttering vast sections of the military machine. There are few activities on Earth as environmentally catastrophic as waging war. Significant reductions to the Pentagon’s budget and shrinking its capacity to wage war would cause a huge drop in demand from the biggest consumer of liquid fuels in the world.

It does no good tinkering around the edges of the war machine’s environmental impact. The money spent procuring and distributing fuel across the US empire could instead be spent as a peace dividend, helping to fund a Green New Deal in whatever form it might take. There are no shortage of policy priorities that could use a funding bump. Any of these options would be better than fueling one of the largest military forces in history.

US unemployment reaches 30 million,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-unemployment-jobless-claims-economy-trump-coronavirus-a9492246.html,"Nearly 3.8 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to trigger a historic economic downturn, bringing the total number of workers laid off since the outbreak began to more than 30 million.

With more employers cutting payrolls to save money, economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20 per cent. That would be the highest rate since it reached 25 per cent during the Great Depression.

Meanwhile, the unemployment rates weren't the only recent economic figures providing a grim outlook on the days ahead.

This week, the government estimated that the economy shrank at a 4.8 per cent annual rate in the first three months of this year, the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Yet the picture is likely to grow far worse: The economy is expected to contract in the April-June quarter by as much as 40 per cent at an annual rate. No previous quarter has been anywhere near as weak since the government began keeping such records after World War II.

As businesses across the country have shut down and laid off tens of millions of workers, the economy has sunk into a near-paralysis in just a few weeks.

Loading....

Factories, hotels, restaurants, department stores, movie theatres and many small businesses are shuttered. Home sales are falling. Households are slashing spending. Consumer confidence is also sinking.

Critics of President Donald Trump slammed the White House over its seemingly slow response to the pandemic after the latest unemployment numbers were released.

“Today’s numbers are a result of the President’s failure to prepare for a pandemic,” Kyle Herring, president of the government watchdog group Accountable.US, said in a statement sent to The Independent. “Now that we’re in the midst of a crisis, the administration is more interested in helping big businesses and special interests than supporting small businesses on the brink of collapse.”

He added: “The American people need access to testing, safe work environments, and confidence in our government.”

With some signs that the viral outbreak may have plateaued at least in certain areas of the country, a few governors have taken tentative steps to begin reopening their economies. But surveys show that a large majority of Americans remain wary of returning to shopping, travelling and other normal economic activity.

That suggests that many industries will struggle with diminished revenue for weeks or months to come and might be unable to rehire laid-off workers.

Across nearly every industry, nonessential businesses have closed, and workers have been sent home with no clear idea of when or whether they might be recalled. An economic recovery may be months or years off, though governors in a few states have begun allowing some businesses to reopen under certain restrictions."
"'A Really Chilling Moment': Trump Refuses to Allow Dr. Fauci to Answer Question on Dangers of Hydroxychloroquine— ""This is unacceptable.

Before Dr. Anthony Fauci could respond to the question about hydroxychloroquine, Trump—who was standing back and off to the side of the podium—complained that Fauci had already spoken about the drug ""15 times.""

""You don't have to ask the question again,"" said Trump, stepping forward and moving closer to Fauci as another reporter began asking a separate question.

""Dr. Fauci, one of the world's top infectious disease scientists, was just censored live at a White House press conference,"" tweeted Tran.

The exchange came just hours after Fauci, in an appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday morning, said that ""in terms of science, I don't think we could definitively say [hydroxychloroquine] works.""

""The data are really just at best suggestive,"" said Fauci. ""There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect.""

During a press briefing Saturday evening, Trump said ""I really think they should they should take it,"" referring to coronavirus patients and hydroxychloroquine. Three people in Nigeria overdosed on the drug last month after the president said, without evidence, that the drug may be able to combat the novel coronavirus.

In a joint statement on March 25, the American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association, and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists said ""there is no incontrovertible evidence to support off-label use of medications for COVID-19.""

""What do I know?"" Trump asked during the press briefing Sunday night. ""I'm not a doctor."""
"For 420 straight months, Earth has been warmer than average",https://mashable.com/article/420-months-above-average-temperatures-climate-change/?europe=true,"The last time Earth had a month of normal temperatures — compared to the 20th century — was in February 1985 . Lebron James was a crawling infant, just over a month old. Barack Obama was 24. Billie Eilish wouldn’t be born for another 16 years.

It’s now been 420 consecutive months that Earth, overall, has experienced temperatures above the 20th-century average, according to data collected from over 25,000 weather stations and scrutinized by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

On Thursday, the agency published data showing that December 2019 was the second hottest December in 140 years of modern record-keeping, and that the last six Decembers were the warmest six Decembers in recorded history.

The long-term trend is clear, beyond the cultural milestone of 420 straight months of above-normal temperatures:

2019 was the second hottest year on record.

19 of the last 20 years are now the warmest on record.

The ocean continues to accumulate heat and has warmed relentlessly since around 1990.

A routine climate science denialist argument — though willfully ignorant and increasingly pathetic — is that cold or low records were also broken in 2019. Of course, winter still arrives and daily weather will always fluctuate. But a critical point is with added background warming, high temperature records are fast outpacing low temperatures records. It's not even close.

As of mid-December, 364 all-time high temperatures were set in 2019, versus just 70 all-time lows.

""As the climate changes into a warmer climate we do expect to see more extreme warm temperatures,"" Ahira Sánchez-Lugo, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climatologist, told Mashable in December. ""That’s what we’re seeing, and that’s what the data are showing.""

Earths' global temperature anomolies. Notice anything? Image: noaa

2019 was the second hottest year on record, continuing a decades-long trend of warming. The last five years have been the five warmest since modern recordkeeping became possible 140 years ago. https://t.co/SdeVwaPM9r pic.twitter.com/1d4HIwudJY — NASA GISS (@NASAGISS) January 15, 2020

Meanwhile, Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, are now skyrocketing. CO2 levels haven't been this high in at least 800,000 years — though more likely millions of years. What's more, carbon levels are now rising at rates that are unprecedented in both the geologic and historic record.

These rapid and robust changes are unequivocally heating Earth and continually breaking daily, monthly, and annual records. ""As we have shown in recent work, the record warm streaks we’ve seen in recent years simply cannot be explained without accounting for the profound impact we are having on the planet through the burning of fossil fuels and the resulting increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations,"" climate scientist Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, told Mashable after Earth experienced its hottest ever month of June in 2019.

Earth will soon hit another 420 milestone, perhaps in 2021. Global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations nearly hit 415 parts per million, or ppm, in 2019.

But with ever-rising carbon-emissions, 420 ppm is a sure bet."
We can’t return to normal because our normal was the problem in the first place.,https://www.kabbalah.info/net/coronavirus-and-emergency-economy/,"At the moment, governments are trying to inject businesses and businesspeople with financial oxygen until the pandemic passes. But it won’t pass so quickly. In my estimate, we’re looking at 12-18 months before it fades away. But more importantly, when it’s over, people will have changed dramatically; they will not want to revert to the old way of life.

Graffiti in Hong Kong reads: “We can’t return to normal because our normal was the problem in the first place.” How very true. Some business will return, but a great many will not because they were redundant to begin with so resuscitating them is nothing but a waste of taxpayers’ money. Instead of wasting, governments should declare an “emergency economy” and freeze everything until the dust settles. After several months it will be easier to see what to keep and to what we should bid farewell.

“The more obstinate we are recognizing the onset of the new phase in humanity, the more painfully that phase will impose itself on us.”

So the first thing that governments need to do is make sure that everyone has food and shelter. Every family should get the same per capita, and this will alleviate the need for cash. Guaranteeing food and shelter for each person is much less costly than transferring money to people’s accounts, and guarantees that they will not waste it on unessential needs.

In the meantime, the business and finance sectors should be put on hold: All transactions, lending and paying of loans, everything and everyone should simply take a break.

The more obstinate we are recognizing the onset of the new phase in humanity, the more painfully that phase will impose itself on us. If you think of social changes like a train ride, then the train has left the dock on its way to a new station, and it will not stop until we’re there.

Alleviating the Transition

My intention in writing this article is not to intimidate anyone. On the contrary, I want the necessary transition we all have to undergo to be as smooth, quick, and pleasant as possible. Humanity has suffered enough; there’s no need to add unnecessary agony.

To help us alleviate the shift, we should supplement the provision of food and shelter with information about the process unfolding the world over. Many people already feel that nature is rejuvenating quickly since we’ve been told to stay at home. They realize that we have done too much harm and that we cannot go on this way.

Now we should extend this realization to the relationships between us. Our ill-will toward each other has cost us far more pain and ill-health than the coronavirus. Worse yet, it has made us uncaring for each other no less than we are uncaring for nature. When we rear people in a dog-eat-dog mentality, is it a wonder that this is how they also treat nature?

Therefore, the healing must begin with us. Once we learn how dependent we are on each other, we will stop treating one another like enemies. We will realize that by seeing to each other’s well being we will be seeing to our own well being, and nothing teaches us this lesson better than COVID-19.

Our compulsory slowdown is not aimless; it is for us to reflect on our lives and their meaning. Now that consumerism has been stopped by force-majeure, we have time to ask why we needed it in the first place, what we gained by it, and who gained from it. Certainly not us.

We are living in the twilight of one era and the dawn of another. It has not risen yet, but if we teach ourselves about it work shoulder to shoulder to embrace it, it will rise and shine on a new humanity: ready to welcome the new epoch with open arms that are joined together."
Rikers Island Prisoners Being Offered PPE and $6 an Hour to Dig Mass Graves,https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/rikers-island-coronavirus-mass-graves/,"New York City is offering prisoners at Rikers Island jail $6 per hour — a fortune by prison labor standards — and personal protective equipment if they agree to help dig mass graves on Hart Island, according to sources with knowledge of the offer. Avery Cohen, a spokesperson for the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the general arrangement, but said that it was not “Covid-specific,” noting that prisoners have been digging graves on Hart Island for years. The offer is only being made to those with convictions, not those jailed before trial, as is generally the case. A memo sent to prisoners, according to a source who reviewed it, does not specify what the work on Hart Island will be, but the reference to PPE leaves little doubt. The offer comes as New York City continues to be the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, with 38,000 people infected and more than 914 dead so far. New York City owns and operates a public cemetery on Hart Island, which has long been maintained by prison labor. The island was identified as a potential resting place for a surge of bodies in the event of a pandemic by a 2008 report put together by the NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner.

Hart Island, though, “has limited burial space,” the report noted, and “may not be able to accommodate a large influx of decedents requiring burial,” which the preparedness plan estimated at between 50,000 and 200,000 in a pandemic with a mortality rate of 2 percent in which 25 to 35 percent of the population is infected. The city document proposed employing the Department of Defense’s “temporary mass internment method,” which places caskets 10 in a row, head to foot, so as not to stack them on top of each other. Hart Island is located off City Island in the Bronx. In 2008, Rikers prisoners were burying roughly 20 to 25 bodies per week there, the report found. Prisoners may be safer in the fresh air of Hart Island, digging mass graves while wearing PPE, than sitting back in the unfolding human rights catastrophe that is Rikers, an overcrowded cesspool that has become widely infected with coronavirus. Prisoners who are involved in burials are routinely provided with PPE, Cohen said."

Chinese billionaire Jack Ma says the US wasted trillions on warfare instead of investing in infrastructure,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/18/chinese-billionaire-jack-ma-says-the-us-wasted-trillions-on-warfare-instead-of-investing-in-infrastructure.html?__source=facebook%7Cmain,"Alibaba founder Jack Ma fired a shot at the United States in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Ma was asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin about the U.S. economy in relation to China, since President-elect Donald Trump has been talking about imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports.

Ma says blaming China for any economic issues in the U.S. is misguided. If America is looking to blame anyone, Ma said, it should blame itself.

""It's not that other countries steal jobs from you guys,"" Ma said. ""It's your strategy. Distribute the money and things in a proper way.""



He said the U.S. has wasted over $14 trillion in fighting wars over the past 30 years rather than investing in infrastructure at home.

To be sure, Ma is not the only critic of the costly U.S. policies of waging war against terrorism and other enemies outside the homeland. Still, Ma said this was the reason America's economic growth had weakened, not China's supposed theft of jobs.

In fact, Ma called outsourcing a ""wonderful"" and ""perfect"" strategy.

""The American multinational companies made millions and millions of dollars from globalization,"" Ma said. ""The past 30 years, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, they've made tens of millions — the profits they've made are much more than the four Chinese banks put together. ... But where did the money go?""

He said the U.S. is not distributing, or investing, its money properly, and that's why many people in the country feel wracked with economic anxiety. He said too much money flows to Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Instead, the country should be helping the Midwest, and Americans ""not good in schooling,"" too.

""You're supposed to spend money on your own people,"" Ma said. ""Not everybody can pass Harvard, like me."" In a previous interview, Ma said he had been rejected by Harvard 10 times.



Along those lines, Ma stressed that globalization is a good thing, but it, too, ""should be inclusive,"" with the spoils not just going to the wealthy few.

""The world needs new leadership, but the new leadership is about working together,"" Ma said. ""As a business person, I want the world to share the prosperity together.""

“We must take control of our environmental movement and our future from billionaires and their permanent war on Planet Earth. They are not our friends.”

-Jeff Gibbs, director of “Planet of the Humans”

It is hard to think of an American film that provoked a greater backlash in 2020 than “Planet of the Humans.” Focused on the theme of planetary extinction and fanciful proposals to ward it off, the documentary was released for free on YouTube on April 21. The date was significant not only because it was the eve of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, but because a global pandemic was tearing through America’s social fabric and exposing the human toll of the country’s globalized, growth-obsessed economic model.

Even before “Planet of the Humans” was released, however, the producers of the film had fallen under pressure to retract it. Upon the film’s release, a who’s who of self-styled climate justice activists proceeded to blanket the internet with accusations that it was a racist, “eco-fascist” screed that deliberately advanced the interests of the oil and gas industry. When “Planet of the Humans” was briefly yanked from YouTube thanks to a questionable copyright claim by an angry climate warrior, the free speech organization Pen America issued a remarkable statement characterizing the demands for retraction as a coordinated censorship campaign.

What had this documentary done to inflame so much opposition from the faces and voices of professional climate justice activism? First, it probed the well-established shortcomings of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power that have been marketed as a green panacea. “Planet of the Humans” portrayed these technologies as anything but green, surveying the environmental damage already caused by solar and wind farms, which require heavy mining and smelting to produce, destroy swaths of pristine land, and sometimes demand natural gas to operate.

While major environmental outfits have lobbied for a Green New Deal to fuel a renewables-based industrial revolution, and are now banking on a Democratic presidency to enact their proposals, “Planet of the Humans” put forward a radical critique that called their entire agenda into question.

As the director of the documentary, Jeff Gibbs, explained, “When we focus on climate change only as the thing destroying the planet and we demand solutions, we get used by forces of capitalism who want to continue to sell us the disastrous illusion that we can mine and smelt and industrialize our way out of this extinction event. And again, behind the scenes, much of what we’re doing to ‘save’ the planet is to burn the ‘bio’ of the planet as green energy.”

“Planet of the Humans” crossed another bright green line by taking aim at the self-proclaimed climate justice activists themselves, painting them as opportunists who had been willingly co-opted by predatory capitalists. The filmmakers highlighted the role of family foundations like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in cultivating a class of professional activists that tend toward greenwashing partnerships with Wall Street and the Democratic Party to coalitions with anti-capitalist militants and anti-war groups.

Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org and guru of climate justice activism, is seen throughout “Planet of the Humans” consorting with Wall Street executives and pushing fossil fuel divestment campaigns that enable powerful institutions to reshuffle their assets into plastics and mining while burnishing their image. McKibben has even called for environmentalists to cooperate with the Pentagon, one of the world’s worst polluters and greatest exporters of violence, because “when it speaks frankly, [it] has the potential to reach Americans who won’t listen to scientists.”

Perhaps the most provocative critique contained in “Planet of the Humans” was the portrayal of full-time climate warriors like McKibben as de facto lobbyists for green tech billionaires and Wall Street investors determined to get their hands on the whopping $50 trillion profit opportunity that a full transition to renewable technology represents. Why have figures like Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Michael Bloomberg, Virgin’s Richard Branson, and Tesla founder Elon Musk been plowing their fortunes into climate advocacy? The documentary taunted those who accepted these oligarchs’ gestures of environmental concern at face value.

For years, leftist criticism of professional climate activism has been largely relegated to blogs like Wrong Kind of Green, which maintains an invaluable archive of critical work on the co-optation of major environmental organizations by the billionaire class. Prominent greens might have been able to dismiss scrutiny from radical corners of the internet as background noise; however, they were unable to ignore “Planet of the Humans.”

That was because Oscar-winning documentarian Michael Moore put his name on the film as executive producer, alongside his longtime producer, Gibbs, and the scholar-researcher Ozzie Zehner. “Michael Moore validates this film,” Josh Fox, the filmmaker who led the campaign against “Planet of the Humans,” told me. “So if Michael Moore’s name is not on that film, it’s like a thousand other crappy movies.”

By racking up millions of views after just a month on YouTube, “Planet of the Humans” threatened to provoke an unprecedented debate about the corruption of environmental politics by the one percent. But thanks to the campaign by Fox and his allies, much of the debate wound up focused on the film itself, and the credibility of its producers.

“I had some sense that the film was going to ruffle some feathers, but I was unprepared for that response from what ended up being a group of people who are like an echo chamber – all related to the same funding organizations,” said Zehner. “It’s a pretty tight circle and it was a really strong, virulent pushback.”

The line of attack that may have gained the most traction in progressive circles portrayed a convoluted section of the film on the dangers of population growth and overconsumption as Malthusian, and even racist. Zehner told me he considered the attacks opportunistic, but “from a public relations standpoint, they were effective. What we were trying to do was highlight the dangers of a consumption-based economic model.”

The backlash to “Planet of the Humans” also related to its portrayal of renewables as badly flawed sources of energy that were also environmentally corrosive. Many of those attacks painted the film’s presentation of solar and wind to present the documentary as out of date and filled with misinformation.

Oddly, the professional activists who coordinated the campaign to bury “Planet of the Humans” glossed over an entire third of the documentary which focused on the corruption and co-optation of environmental politics by “green” foundations and “green” investors.

As this investigation will reveal, those climate justice activists were bound together by support from the same family foundations, billionaire investors, and industry interests that were skewered in the film.

“Censorship, plain and simple”

The ringleader of the push to suppress “Planet of the Humans” was Josh Fox, the Oscar-nominated director of the film “Gasland,” which highlighted the destructive practices inherent to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Fox launched the campaign with a sign-on letter calling for the documentary to be retracted by its producers. Then, in an incendiary takedown published in The Nation, he branded Michael Moore “the new flack for oil and gas,” a racist, and “eco-fascist” for producing the film.

As videographer Matt Orfalea reported, Fox’s crusade began the night Moore’s film was released, with an unhinged mass email to online publishers that blasted the documentary as “A GIGANTIC CROCK OF SHIT.” Fox commanded, “It must come down off your pages immediately.”

Hours later, Fox fired off another breathless email to a group of public relations professionals. “A number of reputable websites are hosting this abomination and I need your support in getting them to take it down,” he wrote. The following day, Fox took to Twitter to assure his ally, 350.org founder Bill McKibben, “We are on it.”

Next, Fox organized a sign-on letter demanding the film “be retracted by its creators and distributors and an apology rendered for its misleading content.” Among the letter’s signatories was academic and renewables advocate Leah C. Stokes, who proclaimed her wish in an article in Vox that “this film will be buried, and few will watch it or remember it.”

On April 24, Josh Fox claimed he had successfully pressured an online video library, Films For Action, into removing “Planet of the Humans” from its website. His victory lap turned out to be premature, as Films For Action re-posted the film and publicly condemned Fox’s campaign to drive it into oblivion.

#PlanetOfTheHumans is worthy of a good critique, but we don't support the campaign to have the film removed from Youtube, and we definitely don't support abusing copyright law (in a clear case of 'fair use') to accomplish that goal. https://t.co/G6pvuOsb0P — Films For Action (@FilmsForAction) May 26, 2020

The relentless push by Fox and others eventually triggered a striking statement by PEN America, the free speech advocacy group. “Calls to pull a film because of disagreement with its content are calls for censorship, plain and simple,” PEN America declared.

“Listen, nobody called to censor this movie,” Fox insisted to me. “We asked the filmmakers as part of their community to retract it, because it unfairly attacked people that we know are good, honest dealers and its premise was wrong and false.”

Fox likened “Planet of the Humans” to radio host Mike Daisey’s monologue on visiting the Foxconn factory in China where iPhones are made, and which was retracted by NPR after major fabrications came to light. “It’s clear to me that the filmmakers… put incorrect information into the film that they knew was incorrect. That thing was out of date,” Fox said of the Moore-produced documentary. “And many, many people from within our community reached out to them, which I didn’t know actually, prior to the release of the film and said, ‘This information is incorrect. What are you doing?'”

Fox was particularly incensed at Michael Moore for attaching his reputation to the film. He described the famed director as one of “the bad guys”; “a megalomaniacal multi-millionaire who craves attention unlike anyone I’ve ever met”; “the 800-pound elephant in the room”; the maker of a “racist” and “eco-fascist” film; and “a multi-millionaire circus barker” guilty of “journalistic malpractice.”

“The real bully is Michael Moore here,” Fox maintained. “It’s not me.”

Though Fox and his allies did not succeed in erasing “Planet of the Humans” from the internet, the documentary was momentarily removed from YouTube on the grounds of a copyright claim by a British photographer named Toby Smith. In a tweet he later deleted, Smith said his opposition to the film was “personal,” blasting it as a “baseless, shite doc built on bull-shit and endless copyright infringements.”

As the attacks on “Planet of the Humans” snowballed, director Jeff Gibbs attempted to defend his film. Following an article at The Guardian branding the film as “dangerous,” Gibbs emailed the paper’s opinion editors requesting a right of reply. He told me they never responded. However, just hours after Toby Smith’s politically-motivated copyright claim prompted YouTube to remove Gibbs’ documentary, he said The Guardian reached out to him for comment. “How’d they catch that so early?” he wondered.

A few left-wing journalists tried to push back on the attacks as well. But in almost every case, they were spiked by editors at ostensibly progressive journals. Christopher Ketcham, author of “This Land: How Cowboys, Capitalism, and Corruption are Ruining the American West,” was among those unable to find a venue in which to defend the documentary.

“I have come across very few editors radical enough to have the exceedingly difficult conversation about the downscaling, simplification, and the turn (in the developed world) toward diminished affluence that a 100 percent renewable energy system will necessarily entail,” Ketcham reflected to me. “You see, they have to believe that they can keep their carbon-subsidized entitlements, their toys, their leisure travel — no behavioral change or limits needed — and it will all be green and ‘sustainable.'”

Naomi Klein, perhaps the most prominent left-wing writer on climate-related issues in the West, did not weigh in to defend “Planet of the Humans.” Instead, the Intercept columnist, social activist, and Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture, and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University was an early participant in the campaign to suppress the film.

According to McKibben, “Naomi [Klein] had in fact taken Moore aside in an MSNBC greenroom” before the documentary’s release to lobby him against publishing the film. Klein later signed Josh Fox’s open letter demanding the film be retracted.

On Twitter, Klein condemned “Planet of the Humans” as “truly demoralizing,” and promoted a “big blog/fact check” of the film by Ketan Joshi, a former communications officer for the Australian wind farm company Infigen Energy.

Thank you for writing this. It is truly demoralizing how much damage this film has done at a moment when many are ready for deep change. There are important critiques of an environmentalism that refuses to reckon with unlimited consumption + growth. But this film ain't it. https://t.co/BmO7ABsIhZ — Naomi Klein (@NaomiAKlein) April 26, 2020

Mining a green future and burying the cost

Like most opponents of “Planet of the Humans,” Ketan Joshi painted the documentary as “a dumb old bull in the china shop that is 2020’s hard-earned climate action environment.” And along with other critics, he accused the film’s co-producers, Gibbs and Zehner, of wildly misrepresenting the efficiency of renewables.

To illustrate his point, he referenced a scene depicting the Cedar Street Solar Array in Lansing, Michigan with flexible solar panels running at 8% efficiency – purportedly enough to generate electricity for just 10 homes. Because that scene was part of a historical sequence filmed in 2008, Joshi dismissed it as an example of the film’s “extreme oldness.”

However, this February, the solar trade publication PV Magazine found that Tesla’s newest line of flexible solar shingles had an efficiency rate of 8.1% – almost exactly the same as those depicted in “Planet of the Humans.”

While it is true that mono-crystalline solar panels boast a higher efficiency rate (between 15% and 18% in commercially available form), they were also on the market back in 2008. These panels are significantly more expensive than the flexible, less efficient panels, however. And their efficiency levels do not account for the intermittency inherent to solar energy, which does not work well in cloudy or dark conditions.

Yet according to Josh Fox, the most vehement opponent of “Planet of the Humans,” the planet-saving capacity of solar and other supposedly clean forms of energy was so well-established it was beyond debate.

“The premise of the film is renewable energy doesn’t work and is dependent on fossil fuels. And that is patently ridiculous,” Fox remarked to me. “And the reason why I got into this is because I had young environmentalists – young people who are steadfast campaigners – calling me in the middle of the night, freaking out, [telling me] ‘I can’t believe this!’ And I looked at them and I said, ‘Well, there’s a reason why you can’t believe this; it’s because it’s not true.'”

But was the presentation of renewable energy sources in “Planet of the Humans” actually false? Ecological economist William Rees has claimed that “despite rapid growth in wind and solar generation, the green energy transition is not really happening.” That might be because it is chasing energy growth instead of curtailing it. Rees pointed out that the surge in global demand for electricity last year “exceeded the total output of the world’s entire 30-year accumulation of solar power installations.”

Are there not reasonable grounds then to be concerned about the practicality of a full transition to renewables, especially in a hyper-capitalist, growth-obsessed economy like that of the United States?

A September 2018 scientific study delivered some conclusions that contradicted the confident claims of renewables advocates. A research team measured solar thermal plants currently in operation around the world and found that they are dependent on the “intensive use of materials,” which is code for heavily mined minerals.

Further, the researchers found that the output of these plants was marred by “significant seasonal intermittence” due to shifting weather patterns and the simple fact that the sun does not always shine.

The negative impact of massive wind farms on the environment and marginalized communities – an issue highlighted in “Planet of the Humans” – is also a serious concern, especially in the Global South. Anthropologist and “Renewing Destruction: Wind Energy Development, Conflict and Resistance in a Latin American Context” author Alexander Dunlap published a peer-reviewed 2017 study of wind farms in the indigenous Tehuantepec region of Oaxaca, Mexico, which has been marketed as one of the most ideal wind generation sites in the world. Dunlap found that the supposedly renewable projects “largely reinforced income inequality, furthered poverty entrenchment and increased food vulnerability and worker dependency on the construction of more wind parks, which cumulatively has led to an increase in work-related out-migration and environmental degradation.”

When wind turbines reach the end of their life cycle, their fiberglass blades, which can be as long as a football field, are impossible to recycle. As a result, they are piling up in rural dumping sites across the US. Meanwhile, the environmentalist magazine Grist warned this August of a “solar e-waste glut” that will produce “megatons of toxic trash” when solar panels begin to lose efficiency and die.

In response to my questions about so-called renewable energy, Fox referred me to a close ally, Anthony Ingraffea, who signed his letter calling for “Planet of the Humans” to be pulled. A civil engineer and co-founder of Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy, which advocates for renewables, Ingraffea is a former oil and gas industry insider who turned into a forceful opponent of fracking. In the past six years, he has produced scientific assessments for the governments of New York State and California on a transition to mostly renewable energy sources.

Ingraffea slammed “Planet of the Humans” as “way off base” and derided research by Ozzie Zehner, the co-producer, as “conspiracy theory shit.” He contrasted his credentials with those of Zehner, boasting that while he has earned 15,000 citations in peer-reviewed academic journals during his career as an engineer, Zehner had chalked up a mere 300.

When I turned to the subject of social and environmental damage caused by so-called renewables, Ingraffea argued that the burning, storing, and transportation of fossil fuels outweighed any of those costs. According to Ingraffea, when New York State makes a decisive transition to renewables, only about 2% of the state’s land would be occupied by solar and wind farms – which translates to about 1,100 square miles.

He pointed to the New York State Assembly’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act as an embodiment of the foresight of proponents of a near-total transition to renewable energy. The bill, which calls for the state to run 70% of its publicly generated energy off of “renewable energy systems” by 2030, also mandates that “35 percent of investments from clean energy and energy efficiency funds [be] invested in disadvantaged communities.”

“That’s wisdom speaking,” Ingraffea said of the legislation. “That’s telling you that yes, we are aware of the problem that you said we should be aware of. Yeah, we’re not all dumb. We’re not all crazy. We’re not all ideological. Not all technical nerds who just fall in love and want to make sex with solar panels.”

However, the communities (or their designated NGO representatives) supposedly compensated through the New York State bill are not located in the regions that will be most impacted by the extraction necessary to manufacture so-called renewables. Already devastated by coups and neocolonial exploitation, swathes of the Global South from Bolivia to Congo – home to massive reserves of cobalt hand-mined in “slave conditions” for electric car batteries and iPhones – are being further destabilized by the minerals rush.

Even mainstream environmentalists acknowledge that rising reliance on renewable energy “means a lot of dirty mining” to extract the minerals required for electric batteries and solar cells. This prospect has sparked excitement within the mining industry, with the editor of Mining.com, Frik Els, dubbing Green New Deal spokeswomen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg “mining’s unlikely heroines.”

“Going all in on the green economy and decarbonisation requires siding with the greens against fossil fuels,” Els informed fellow mining industry insiders. “It means selling global mining as the solution to climate change because mining metals is the only path to green energy and green transport.”

The inevitable rush on minerals required to power the green revolution has not exactly delighted residents of the Global South, however.

Evo Morales, the indigenous former president of Bolivia, was driven from power in 2019 by a military junta backed by the United States and local oligarchs, in what he branded a lithium coup. With the world’s largest untapped lithium resources, Bolivia is estimated to hold as much as half of the world’s reserves. Under Morales, the country guaranteed that only state-owned firms could mine the mineral.

The ousted socialist leader argued that multi-national corporations supported his right-wing domestic opponents in order to get their hands on Bolivia’s lithium – an essential element in the electric batteries that provide the cornerstone to a digital economy dependent on smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. “As a small country of 10 million inhabitants, we were soon going to set the price of lithium,” Morales said. “They know we have the greatest lithium reserves in the world [in a space of] 16,000 square kilometers.”

Just before the military coup in Bolivia, a report (PDF) by the World Economic Forum’s Global Battery Alliance reported that the global demand for electric batteries will increase 14-fold before 2030. Almost half of today’s lithium is mined to produce electric batteries, and the demand for the mineral will only rise as power grids incorporate high levels of battery powered tech and the demand for electric vehicles increases.

Electric batteries are also heavily reliant on cobalt, most of which is mined from Congo, and often in illegal and dangerous conditions by child labor. In December 2019, over a dozen Congolese plaintiffs sued Apple, Google’s Alphabet parent company, Microsoft, Dell, and Tesla, accusing them of “knowingly benefiting from and aiding and abetting the cruel and brutal use of young children in Democratic Republic of Congo (‘DRC’) to mine cobalt.”

This July, Tesla CEO and electric battery kingpin Elon Musk appeared to take partial credit for the 2019 military coup that forced Bolivia’s Evo Morales from power, asserting that big tech billionaires like him could “coup whoever we want.”

The payoff for all the dirty and deadly mining required to manufacture the solar panels, wind turbines, and electric batteries required to power the new industrial revolution is supposed to be a planet no longer faced with a “climate emergency” – and nevermind the damage to the Earth and its non-human inhabitants. But with the demand for electricity constantly growing, is it even possible to power an economy like that of the US with entirely renewable sources of energy (excluding nuclear)?

A scientific projection by one of the closest allies of Josh Fox and Anthony Ingraffea was supposed to have answered that question and put all doubts to bed. Instead, it resulted in acrimony and embarrassment for its author.

The 2050 transition goal: real science or a murky crystal ball?

In his piece hammering “Planet of the Humans” in The Nation, Fox touted “the proliferation of 100 percent renewable energy plans put forward by Stanford University Professor Mark Jacobson” as one of the most important pieces of evidence refuting the film’s grim narrative.

Jacobson’s study, according to National Geographic, was “a foundation stone” of the Green New Deal proposal put forward by Democratic Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was also central to the energy plan advanced by the presidential campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who co-authored an op-ed with Jacobson that called for a full transition to “clean” energy by 2050.

Jacobson, like Ingraffea, is an environmental engineer and political partner of Fox. The Stanford professor helped Fox found the environmental advocacy organization the Solutions Project, alongside actor Mark Ruffalo and the banker and former Tesla executive Marco Krapels in 2011. (More on this group later.)

Besides his working relationship with Jacobson, Fox failed to acknowledge that the professor’s all-renewables projection was strongly challenged by 21 leading energy scientists in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal. The scientists concluded Jacobson’s paper was rife with “invalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions.”

A survey of the debate by Scientific American scoffed at Jacobson’s remarkable assumption “that U.S. hydroelectric dams could add turbines and transformers to produce 1,300 gigawatts of electricity instantaneously… or the equivalent of about 1000 large nuclear or coal power plants running at full power.”

Jacobson retaliated against his critics by filing a $10 million defamation lawsuit, which he was forced to withdraw in 2018. Legal commentator Kenneth White described the suit as “clearly vexatious and intended to silence dissent about an alleged scientist’s peer-reviewed article.”

This April, a DC Superior Court judge invoked anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) legislation that reportedly ordered Jacobson to pay the defendants’ legal fees.

“Planet of the Humans” co-producer Ozzie Zehner saw Mark Jacobson’s flameout as a symptom of a wider problem within mainstream climate activism. “When Big Greens talk about ‘facts,’ they often aren’t talking about what most people understand to be facts,” he explained. “They’re usually talking about models, which attempt to predict the future based on estimations of physical conditions, projections, and assumptions. Greens industrialists claim they can accurately model a renewable energy future and its effects on the global biosphere. But our best science can’t even model a fish tank.”

Ingraffea insisted that Jacobson’s legal fight had only begun, and said the professor’s critics were “partially driven by Mark [Jacobson] having made a very famous name for himself in an arena with many other people working, and they’re not getting all the fame.”

Jacobson echoed this line in his own defense: “They don’t like the fact that we’re getting a lot of attention, so they’re trying to diminish our work.”

“Give the guy a break,” Ingraffea appealed. “You know, if he’s wrong, of course he’s wrong. No one’s going to be right. No one could possibly be right right now about what’s going to happen in 25 years. We’re all entitled to our projections. We’re all entitled to our crystal balls.”

That same courtesy was not extended by Ingraffea and his allies to the makers of “Planet of the Humans,” however. “We were unable to identify any factual errors in the film, and we’re open to the idea that we could be wrong about some things,” Zehner said. “But we’d like to have that debate and not be shut down.”

Among the wave of attacks on “Planet of the Humans,” a disproportionate number were churned out by renewables industry insiders, from an “innovation strategist” at the Green Power Energy firm that was criticized in the film for clearing a Vermont mountaintop to build a wind farm (“For me, this film was personal,” he stated), to Now You Know, a podcast by two mega-fans of Elon Musk who fawningly refer to the billionaire as “Elon” and have proudly declared that they are “long on Tesla stock.”

Missing from nearly all of the takedowns was the documentary’s scathing critique of the corruption of environmental politics by billionaires and elite family foundations.

“The conversation our critics really didn’t want to have was about the last one-third of the film,” Zehner remarked, “which dealt with the influence of billionaires and money in the environmental movement, and the divestment sham.”

The shell game of fossil fuel divestment

The tactic of fossil fuel divestment is at the heart of the so-called climate justice movement’s plan to defeat the fossil fuel industry. Launched by Bill McKibben’s 350.org and a coalition of professional activists soon after the re-election of President Barack Obama in 2012, the campaign has resulted in institutions like Oxford University and Goldman Sachs supposedly divesting their holdings in oil and gas companies. Campaigners like McKibben simultaneously encouraged their constituents to invest in funds whose portfolios were supposedly free of fossil fuel companies.

“Planet of the Humans” raked this tactic over the proverbial coals, demonstrating how investment funds endorsed by 350.org have engaged in a shell game in which fossil fuel assets are simply replaced with investments in plastics, mining, oil and gas infrastructure companies, and biomass.

“The big issue with divestment is that it absolves the destructive power of extreme wealth,” Zehner explained. “It’s saying that family foundations can be forgiven and money can be moved into mining, gas and oil infrastructure, solar, wind, and biomass. They divest from the brand name coal companies while investing in infrastructure companies that support coal mining.”

In one of the most controversial scenes in “Planet of the Humans,” Bill McKibben was seen inaugurating a wood-burning biomass energy plant at Middlebury College, where he has been a scholar-in-residence. The environmental leader praised the initiative as “an act of courage.”

Because the event took place in 2009, McKibben and his allies have attacked the scene as an unfair representation of his current position. In an official 350.org response to “Planet of the Humans,” McKibben claimed that his views on biomass have evolved, leading him to cease his support for the energy source in 2016.

Yet less than a week after The Nation published Josh Fox’s incendiary attack on Michael Moore and “Planet of the Humans,” Nation editor-in-chief D.D. Guttenplan hosted an event with McKibben that was sponsored by a fund with major investments in several wood-to-energy biomass companies.

Called Domini Impact Investments, the fund claims to hold investments in “68 companies… that both impact forests and depend on them, whether for forest derived products or ecosystem services.” One such Domini holding is a wood-to-energy company called Ameresco, which builds “large, utility-scale biomass-to-energy plants,” according to its website.

Domini Impact also features its sustainable “timber” holdings, including Klabin SA, a company with logging operations spanning 590,580 acres in Brazil. Klabin SA manufactures pulp and paper products and operates a 270MW on-site black liquor biomass plant. This May, just days after Domini sponsored McKibben’s talk, the company purchased a second biomass plant.

(Fabio Schvartzman, the former CEO of Klabin SA, was charged with 270 counts of homicide in Brazil this January, after allegedly concealing knowledge of an imminent dam burst to protect the share price of his current company, Vale. The 2019 Mariana dam collapse has been described as Brazil’s worst environmental disaster.)

While introducing the Domini-sponsored event with McKibben, The Nation’s Guttenplan stated, “By investing in the Domini Funds, you can help build a better future for the planet and its people, and be part of a movement working to address a wide range of social and environmental issues including human rights, climate change mitigation and forest stewardship.”

Neither McKibben nor Guttenplan responded to email requests for comment from The Grayzone.

Domini Funds was hardly the only investment fund that McKibben has partnered with to promote fossil fuel divestment – and which has engaged in the shell game exposed in “Planet of the Humans.”

In what was perhaps the film’s most devastating scene, narrator Jeff Gibbs detailed how McKibben has advised 350.org members to direct their money into the Green Century Fund, an investment portfolio that boasts of being “wholly owned by environmental and public health nonprofit organizations,” and free of fossil fuel stock.

As “Planet of the Humans” revealed, however, the Green Century Funds’ portfolio has contained heavy investments in mining companies, oil, and gas infrastructure companies, including an exploiter of tar sands, the biofuel giant Archer Daniels Midland, McDonald’s, Coca Cola (the world’s leading plastic pollution proliferator), logging giants, and big banks from Bank of America to HSBC.

Asked about this section of the film, Josh Fox dismissed it as out of date. He claimed that “the entire idea of what constitutes a divested fund has changed really radically over the last eight years, starting at first from just oil, coal and gas investments, to then encompassing things like plastics and the meat industry and derivatives and all other options.”

However, a probe of the 2019 Securities and Exchange Commission filings by Green Century Funds showed the fund held thousands of shares in meat giant McDonald’s and Royal Caribbean Cruises, among other mega-polluters. The latter company’s Harmony of the Seas ship happens to be the most environmentally toxic cruise liner on Earth, relying on three massive diesel engines to burn 66,000 gallons of fuel a day. By the end of one voyage across the Atlantic, the ship has expended the same amount of gasoline as over 5 million automobiles traveling the same distance.

Green Century’s SEC filing boasted that it elicited a pledge from Royal Caribbean “to make its food waste management and reduction strategies more public.” It also claimed to have “helped convince McDonald’s, the largest purchaser of beef in the world, to restrict the use of antibiotics in its beef and chicken supply chains.”

It was a classic case of greenwashing, in which corporate behemoths burnished their reputation among progressives by embracing cosmetic reforms that did little to challenge their bottom lines.

When I informed Fox about Green Century’s ongoing investments in carbon-heavy industries, he said, “Well, I’m all for an investigation of those things on real grounds.”

In the same breath, Fox pivoted to another complaint about “Planet of the Humans”: “The film attacks Bill McKibben in ways that were unfair and untrue.”

Was that the case, though? One of the most provocative points about McKibben and his allies in “Planet of the Humans” – that they function as de facto public relations agents for the “green” billionaires seeking to cash in on the renewables rush – was never coherently answered. But as this investigation reveals, the climate warriors criticized in the film are sponsored by many of those same billionaires, as well as the network of family foundations that help set the agenda for groups like 350.org.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund incubates 350.org

In perhaps the most uncomfortable scene in “Planet of the Humans,” Bill McKibben was shown visibly squirming as an interviewer asked him about family foundation support for his 350.org.

“We’re not exactly Big Greens,” McKibben insisted during a 2011 interview with climate journalist Karyn Strickler. “I’m a volunteer, we’ve got seven people who work full time on this 350.org campaign.”

With a telling smirk on her face, Strickler asked McKibben how his group sustained itself.

“To the degree that we have any money at all it’s come from a few foundations in Europe and the US,” McKibben insisted.

He mentioned “a foundation based in Sweden, I think it’s called the Rasmussen Foundation that I think has been the biggest funder.”

After some prodding by Strickler, a visibly uncomfortable McKibben divulged that the “Rockefeller Brothers Fund gave us some money right when we were starting out. That’s been useful too.”

However, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Rasmussen were not observing the birth of 350.org from the sidelines. In fact, the Rockefeller Brothers were instrumental in establishing 350.org and guiding the organization’s agenda. It began when the foundation incubated a group called 1Sky with a $1 million grant. McKibben immediately joined as board member.

As documented by radical environmentalist Cory Morningstar, 1Sky’s launch was announced at a 2007 gathering of the Clinton Global Initiative by former President Bill Clinton, who stood on stage beside Rockefeller Brothers Fund President Stephen Heintz. Four years later, the Rockefeller Brothers announced “the exciting marriage of 1Sky and 350.org — two grantees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund’s Sustainable Development program.”

Why McKibben was so uncomfortable about discussing his relationship with Rockefeller was unclear. Perhaps he was concerned that the organization he once described as a “scruffy little outfit” would be seen as a central node in the donor-driven non-profit industrial complex.

Whatever his motives were, since the testy exchange with Strickler, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund has contributed over $1 million to McKibben’s 350.org.

Alongside a network of foundations and “green” billionaires, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and its $1.2 billion endowment serves as a primary engine of the network of self-styled “climate justice” activists that sought to steamroll “Planet of the Humans.”

These interests have cohered around the Environmental Grantmakers Association (EGA), which is located in the New York City offices of the Rockefeller Family Fund.

The EGA enables elite foundations and billionaire donors to cultivate a cadre of professional “doers” during retreats in scenic locations. One first-time student attendee said the retreat experience was designed with “the intention of strengthening relationships between funders and build[ing] relationships within the environmental movement.” As soon as she arrived, she was “paired with mentor ‘buddies,’ folks who had been to past EGA Retreats to show us the ropes.”

These encounters take place in Napa Valley, California, or at the Mohonk Mountain House resort in New York’s Hudson Valley. A report by the Threshold Foundation described the theme of the 2015 EGA fall retreat at Mohonk: “‘Fund the Fighters!’ That’s the rallying call from the stars. Not the celestial stars, but from well-known artists such as Mark Ruffalo and Naomi Klein.”

In accordance with its relationship with the EGA’s network of environmental cadres and outfits like 350.org, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund embraced their fossil fuel divestment campaign, shedding its stocks in oil and coal while increasing assets in other industries that can hardly be described as green. A look at the results of the foundation’s move offers another disturbing case study in the divestment shell game.

The Rockefeller Brothers go “green,” invest in Halliburton

In 2014, following consultations with 350.org, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced that it was divesting from fossil fuels. “We were extremely uncomfortable with the moral ambivalence of funding programs around the climate catastrophe while still being invested in the fossil fuels that were bringing us closer to that catastrophe,” Rockefeller Brothers Fund President Stephen Heintz said.

At a December 2015 side session of the UN climate conference in Paris, 350.org executive director May Boeve joined Heintz to celebrate the foundation’s decision to divest. “A growing number of investors representing a growing amount of capital do not want to be associated with this industry any longer,” Boeve stated.

A look at the most recent publicly available financial filing of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, from 2018 (PDF), offered a clear glimpse at the shell game that divestment has entailed.

According to the filing, while the Rockefeller Brothers freed itself of fossil fuels, the foundation remained invested in companies including the oil services giant Halliburton, the Koch-run multinational petroleum transportation partnership Inter Pipeline Ltd, and Caterpillar, whose bulldozers are familiar at scenes of deforestation and Palestinian home demolitions. (Several NGOs that advocate divestment from companies involved in the Israeli occupation of Palestine, such as +972 Magazine and the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, have also received support from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund).

The foundation padded its portfolio with stock in financial industry titans like Citigroup and Wells Fargo, as well as Newcrest Mining, Barrick Gold, Wheaton Precious Metals Corporation, and Agnico Eagle Mines.

The Rockefeller Brothers Fund listed at least $20 million of investments in Vision Ridge Partners, which was itself invested in a biomass company called Vanguard Renewables under the guise of “renewable energy.” In December 2019, Vanguard Renewables forged a partnership with Dominion Energy – the energy giant whose Atlantic Coast Pipeline was defeated this June thanks to grassroots environmental mobilization – to convert methane from farms into natural gas.

Since the Rockefeller Brothers Fund answered 350.org’s call to divest from fossil fuels in 2014, the foundation’s wealth has increased substantially. As the Washington Post reported, “the Rockefeller Brothers fund’s assets grew at an annual average rate of 7.76 percent over the five-year period that ended Dec. 31, 2019.”

The outcome of the Rockefellers’ widely praised move established a clear precedent for other elite institutions: by allowing organizations like 350.org to lead them by the hand, they could greenwash their image, offload stocks in a fossil fuel industry described by financial analysts as a “chronic underperformer,” and protect their investments in growth industries like mining, oil services, and biomass.

McKibben, for his part, has marketed fossil fuel divestment as a win-win strategy for the capitalist class: “The institutions that divested from fossil fuel really did well financially, because the fossil fuel industry has been the worst performing part of our economy… Even if you didn’t care about destroying the planet, you’d want to get out of it because it just loses money.”

Blood and Gore make “the case for long-term greed”

In another move apparently intended to burnish its green image while padding its assets, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund invested over $100 million in Generation Investment Management’s Generation Climate Solutions Fund II and Generation IM Global Equity Fund.

These entities are jointly managed by Al Gore, the former US vice president who negotiated a notorious carbon offsets loophole at the 1997 Kyoto Climate Protocol that has been blamed for the release of 600 million tons of excess emissions. Gore launched the fund alongside David Blood, the ex-CEO of asset management for Goldman Sachs, in order to promote a climate-friendly capitalism.

In a 2015 profile of Blood and Gore’s Generation Investment Management fund, The Atlantic’s James Fallows described their investment strategy as “a demonstration of a new version of capitalism, one that will shift the incentives of financial and business operations” toward a profitable “green” economy – while potentially saving the system of capitalism from itself.

Blood was blunt when asked about his agenda: “We are making the case for long-term greed.”

The banker Blood and the green guru McKibben shared a stage together at the 2013 conference of Ceres, a non-profit that works to consolidate the mutually beneficial relationship between Big Green and Wall Street.

The event featured a cast of corporate executives from companies like Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and GM. Sponsors included Bank of America, PG&E, Bloomberg, Citi, Ford, GM, Prudential, Wells Fargo, TimeWarner, and a collection of Fortune 500 companies.

During their conversation, the investor Blood pledged to mobilize “something in the order of $40 to $50 trillion of capital” in renewables, underscoring the massive profit center that a transition to “green” energy represents.

“It’s entirely dependent on what kind of political will we can muster,” McKibben proclaimed, pledging to work toward Blood’s goal.

The unsettling sight of McKibben discussing multi-trillion dollar profit possibilities with a former Goldman Sachs banker was featured prominently in “Planet of the Humans,” and undoubtedly helped inspire the ferocious backlash against the documentary by the 350.org founder’s network.

McKibben was far from alone among climate justice warriors in his dalliance with the billionaire class, however.

A foundation-supported “ragtag bunch”

Before Josh Fox launched his media blitz against “Planet of the Humans,” he directed a full-length documentary vehicle for 350.org, titled “Divest.” For the 2016 film, Fox followed McKibben and allies like Naomi Klein as they embarked on a cross-country road trip to promote fossil fuel divestment.

Fox’s ties to the professional activists extend to the funding network centered around the Environmental Grantmakers Association. Between 2012 and 2017, Fox’s film company International WOW reported grants totaling $2.5 million. Much of that funding came courtesy of the Rockefeller Brothers Cultural Innovation Fund and Rockefeller MAP fund, as well as the Ford and Park Foundations.

In 2012, the year Fox and his allies launched their campaign promoting fossil fuel divestment, he co-founded an environmental advocacy group called the Solutions Project. He conceived the organization alongside celebrity actor Mark Ruffalo, former Tesla executive Marco Krapels, and Stanford University’s Mark Jacobson – the professor behind the dubious 2050 all-renewables projection.

The four founders gathered seed money from the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation of the eponymous film actor, and from the 11th Hour Foundation of Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, according to Fox. Fox said that after a power struggle and an attempt to force him out in order to raise several million from the Sierra Club, he, Krapels, and Jacobson eventually left the organization.

Krapels has since launched an electric battery company in Brazil – another country that happens to hold a massive reserve of lithium and other minerals necessary for his products. Brazil has experienced a rush on lithium mining in recent years thanks to the roaring demand for lithium-ion batteries.

Krapels’ former partner at Tesla’s disastrous Solar City project, Elon Musk, announced plans this year to build an electric car factory in Brazil. Musk has even reportedly sought an audience with the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, to further his business interests.

He @MMFlint is receiving too much attention for a film which forgot to mention solar panel efficiency is 24% and mislead the viewer to believe its only 9%. Uninspiring and just scientifically wrong. https://t.co/f69zaWJeaP — marco krapels (@KrapelsMarco) April 27, 2020

Today, the Solutions Project is “100% co opted and sold out,” Fox acknowledged. Indeed, the group’s board members currently include Brandon Hurlbut, a former Obama Department of Energy official who founded Boundary Stone Partners – a lobbying firm that represents the nuclear industry. Also on the board is Billy Parish, the founder of Mosaic, a financial firm that declares its “mission to revolutionize two of the biggest industries in the world: energy and finance…” Mosaic’s website states. “We focus on the integration of doing good (for the planet) and doing well (financially).”

According to its website, the Elon Musk Foundation is among the Solutions Project’s funders. The organization describes Musk as “the guy who is trying to save humanity in like four or five different ways,” comparing him to a Marvel Comics superhero.

In reality, Musk is a ferocious union-buster who recently fired workers for staying home as the Covid-19 pandemic hit – but not before deceiving them into believing they had permission to safely quarantine.

Other Solutions Project supporters include the Skoll Global Threats Fund, run by eBay billionaire Jeffrey Skoll. Skoll funded Al Gore’s film on climate change, “An Inconvenient Truth,” which went into production soon after Gore launched his Generation Investment Management fund – an inconvenient truth pointed out by “Planet of the Humans.”

The 11th Hour Project foundation of Google CEO Schmidt and his wife remains a supporter of the Solutions Project after ponying up the seed money to launch it. Asked in 2014 about the inequality and displacement that start-up tech businesses bring to the Bay Area, where Google is located, Schmidt responded, “Let us celebrate capitalism. $19 billion for 50 people? Good for them.”

When I challenged Fox about the co-optation of climate justice politics by tech oligarchs like Skoll, Schmidt, and Musk, he grew defensive. “You have to see these things in a time continuum of us trying to take off big, something bigger than anybody’s ever tried to take on in the world,” he stated, referencing his and his allies’ fight against the fossil fuel industry. “They’re bigger than Nazi Germany, bigger than America. Bigger than all of them combined. We’re a ragtag bunch of extraordinarily committed people who are willing to put our lives on the line to stop the fossil fuel industry.

“Yeah, that’s that’s really laudable,” Fox continued, referring to his own efforts, “and for a multi-millionaire circus barker, as Bill McKibben calls Michael Moore, to take potshots using flawed science, dishonest techniques, misrepresentation of the timeline, and 1,000 other things that are journalistic malpractice and that was called out by an extraordinary number of people – that’s the real story here. The real bully is Michael Moore here. It’s not me.”

The Producer

This year, Josh Fox launched a one-man show and film called “The Truth Has Changed.” According to promotional material for the performance, Fox narrated his experience as “an eyewitness to history” who “was the subject of a 100 million dollar smear campaign from the oil and gas industry.”

“Josh Fox was the beta test for the types of propaganda and smears the gang that created Cambridge Analytica is now known for world wide,” the film’s website stated. “And Josh is telling his story in an uncompromising way like never before.”

The performance was supposed to have enjoyed a lengthy run this January at one of the most renowned venues for political theater in the country, The Public Theater in New York City. But the show was abruptly canceled after the Public accused Fox of violating the theater’s code of conduct through “a series of verbal abuses to the staff.”

Fox, who is Jewish, retaliated by accusing the theater’s directors of anti-Semitism. According to the New York Times, Fox “said he had been told that he was too passionate, too loud and too emotional.”

“To me that is distinctly cultural,” Fox told the paper. “That’s a classic anti-Semitic trope.”

Behind the drama over the monologue’s cancellation, a more salient issue lingered. The executive producer of Fox’s “The Truth Has Changed” was Tom Dinwoodie, a wealthy “cleantech” entrepreneur and engineer who owned dozens of patents on solar technology, and therefore stood to reap a massive windfall profit from the renewables revolution that Fox and his allies were campaigning for.

Dinwoodie, who signed Fox’s letter calling for the retraction of “Planet of the Humans,” was a top donor to the Rocky Mountain Institute, a so-called “do-tank” where he serves as a lead trustee. In 2014, Dinwoodie helped oversee the merger of his think tank with billionaire Virgin CEO Richard Branson’s Carbon War Room, which was founded with “a mission to stimulate business-led market interventions that advance a low-carbon economy.”

“Increasingly, the solutions for climate change are those policy measures that drive economic growth,” a spokesman declares in a video announcing the strategic partnership between Branson’s non-profit and Dinwoodie’s Rocky Mountain “do-tank.”

In the same video, billionaire former Democratic Party presidential candidate and Rocky Mountain Institute donor Tom Steyer emphasized the profit motive behind the renewables transition: “Changing the way we generate and use energy is the largest industry in the history of the world. There is no time to waste.”

This July 9 – the day after the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force released its policy recommendations – the Rocky Mountain Institute launched the Center for Climate Aligned Finance in partnership with four of the biggest banks in the world: Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase.

The initiative, according to Rocky Mountain, will serve as “an engine room for the financial sector to partner with corporate clients to identify practical solutions through deep partnerships with industry, civil society and policymakers to facilitate a transition in the global economy to net-zero emissions by mid-century.”

The partnership represented an obvious boon for green tycoons like Dinwoodie who profit from renewable energy. And for the big banks that continued to top the list of the world’s most prolific investors in the fossil fuel industry, it was another opportunity to greenwash their public image.

Given the economic interests represented by Dinwoodie and his “do-tank,” it was easy to understand why he signed Fox’s letter calling for “Planet of the Humans” to be retracted. The documentary had not only hammered his political partner, Richard Branson, as a PR savvy oligarch exploiting environmental politics; it took aim at the ethos of Big Green outfits that comforted their ruling-class funders with the promise that they could do good while continuing to do well.

When I asked Fox why he thought big tech tycoons and their family foundations were plowing their fortunes into climate activism, he responded, “Probably saving the planet.”

The Danish connection

While wealthy green businessmen like Dinwoodie and Elon Musk furthered their commercial interests by underwriting green advocacy, the V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation and its closely affiliated KR (Kann-Rasmussen) Foundation have strategically directed their resources into nurturing a who’s who of professional climate warriors – including several that played a role in the campaign to suppress “Planet of the Humans.”

Brian Valbjørn Sørensen, the executive director of the KR Foundation, was a former special advisor to the center-left Danish government that lost power in 2015. KR’s chair, Connie Hedegaard, was the ex-minister for climate and energy for the center-right Danish government of Anders Fogg Rasmussen, who went on to serve as secretary general of the NATO military alliance. As the European Union’s first climate chief, Hedegaard argued that renewable energy could strengthen NATO’s soft power against Russia by reducing natural gas imports from the designated enemy state.

KR’s support for groups like 350.org surfaced in “Planet of the Humans” during the cringe-inducing scene in which journalist Karyn Strickler grilled Bill McKibben about his organizational funders. According to the KR Foundation, it donated $2 million to 350.org in 2019.

Toby Smith, the photographer who filed the copyright claim against Planet of the Humans on explicitly “personal” grounds, happened to have been the media outreach director of a KR-funded non-profit called Climate Outreach. As the Rasmussen family’s KR Foundation stated in a recent financial filing, it initiated grants totaling nearly $2 million to Climate Outreach in 2019 alone.

When British columnist George Monbiot published a vitriolic condemnation of “Planet of the Humans” in The Guardian, he neglected to mention that he had been a board member of the Rasmussen-backed Climate Outreach.

The V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation has also supported Naomi Klein’s environmentalist outfit, The Leap, according to the foundation’s website.

Klein, a longtime critic of elite family foundations and the billionaire class, was among the most prominent figures to join the campaign to censor “Planet of the Humans.” As her ally McKibben acknowledged, she unsuccessfully pressured Michael Moore to retract “Planet of the Humans” before it was even released.

Klein has celebrated the Danish government where KR Foundation leaders have served for advancing “some of the most visionary environmental policies in the world.” At the same time, she has denounced the “autocratic industrial socialism” of the Soviet Union and the “petro-populism” of the socialist government of Venezuela, where Denmark has recognized US-backed coup leader Juan Guaidó.

1. @jaketapper: the article you tweeted is full of crap. In my case it Ignores my extensive criticism of Venezuela's petro-populism https://t.co/c5DDUeyiG5 — Naomi Klein (@NaomiAKlein) August 3, 2017

Klein’s recent broadsides against Venezuela contrasted strongly with her signing of a 2004 open letter that proclaimed, “If we were Venezuelan… we would vote for [Hugo] Chavez”; and a 2007 column in which she wrote that thanks to the Chavez government, “citizens had renewed their faith in the power of democracy to improve their lives.”

From Big Green critic to “Planet of the Humans” opponent

Naomi Klein’s opposition to “Planet of the Humans” was surprising given the views she has expressed in the past on mainstream environmental politics. In 2013, for example, she bemoaned the “deep denialism in the environmental movement among the Big Green groups [on how to fight climate change]. And to be very honest with you,” she continued, “I think it’s been more damaging than the right-wing denialism in terms of how much ground we’ve lost.”

In her widely acclaimed 2008 book “The Shock Doctrine,” Klein documenting the Ford Foundation’s role as a CIA cutout that helped establish the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Chicago.

The Ford-funded academic department nurtured the infamous “Chicago Boys,” a group of neoliberal economists led by Milton Friedman who conceived the disaster capitalist “shock doctrine” that inspired the title of Klein’s book. They applied their program to Chile as General Augusto Pinochet’s economic advisors following his CIA-backed military coup to destroy the leftist government of Chilean President Salvador Allende.

Klein also surveyed the Ford Foundation’s support for the “Berkeley Mafia” at the University of California that advised the hyper-repressive junta of General Suharto, which toppled Indonesia’s socialist government in 1965.

“The Berkeley Mafia had studied in the US as part of a program that began in 1956, funded by the Ford Foundation…” Klein wrote. “Ford-funded students became leaders of the campus groups that participated in overthrowing Sukarno, and the Berkeley Mafia worked closely with the military in the lead-up to the coup…”

Henry Kissinger, the Nixon foreign policy guru whom Klein identified as the mastermind of the dirty war in Chile, had previously served as the director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund’s Special Strategies Project, which helped conceive US national security strategies for countering the spread of communism.

Today, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Fund support an array of liberal causes, from diversity and racial justice initiatives to the network of NGO’s organizing for fossil fuel divestment. At the same time, the Ford Foundation backs organizations that push regime change in Latin America, partnering with the US government to fund Freedom House, a DC-based NGO which supported the failed coup to oust Nicaragua’s elected leftist government in 2018. For its part, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund has supported The Syria Campaign, a public relations outfit that clamored for US military intervention to remove the UN-recognized government of Syria.

In 2011, when Klein was appointed to 350.org’s board of directors, she joined forces with an environmental organization incubated by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and supported by the Ford Foundation. “As 350.org founder Bill McKibben puts it: unless we go after the ‘money pollution,’ no campaign against real pollution stands a chance,” Klein wrote at the time.

Klein’s 2015 book and documentary film on climate change, “This Changes Everything,” was initially launched as a project called “The Message.” It was supported with hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants from a who’s who of major family foundations that help sustain McKibben’s political apparatus.

In one of several grants to the book and film project, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund contributed $50,000 to “The Message” via a non-profit pass-through called the Sustainable Markets Foundation. [PDF]

Susan Rockefeller served as a co-executive producer of the documentary version of “This Changes Everything.” Her husband, David Rockefeller Jr. is the son of tycoon David Rockefeller, a US government-linked cold warrior who co-founded the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and helped back the US-managed coup that put Pinochet and the Chicago Boys in power in Chile. Rockefeller Jr., a major supporter of conservationist causes, is a former chairman of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and board member of Rockefeller Financial Services.

In 2014, the Ford Foundation chipped in with $250,000 to Klein’s project. [PDF]

Klein’s “The Message” also benefited from $140,000 in support from the Schmidt Family Foundation of Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy. The Schmidt Family Foundation is an ongoing contributor to McKibben’s 350.org, kicking in $200,000 in 2018 [PDF].

In April 2019, Klein released “A Message From The Future,” a video collaboration with Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and artist and pundit Molly Crabapple, which promoted the Green New Deal as a pathway to a renewable-powered economic utopia.

Crabapple, a vehement supporter of Washington’s campaign for regime change in Syria, is an Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow at the New America Foundation, a Democratic Party-linked think tank substantially funded by Google’s Schmidt, the Ford Foundation and the US State Department.

In a recent The Intercept column, Klein took aim at Schmidt, describing him as one of the billionaires exploiting “a coherent Pandemic Shock Doctrine” to begin “building a high tech dystopia.” She noted that Schmidt is closely aligned with the national security state as chair of the Defense Innovation Board, which consults for the Pentagon on the military’s application of artificial intelligence.

Schmidt also happens to be a proponent of a “smart” energy grid, which he says will “modernize the electric grid to make it look more like the Internet.” Such a model would not only benefit tech companies like Google which make their money buying and selling data, but the U.S. national security state, whose partnerships with big tech companies increase the capacity of its surveillance apparatus.

The Senate version of the Green New Deal calls for the construction of “smart” power grids almost exactly like those Schmidt imagined. Klein and other high-profile Green New Deal proponents have neglected to mention that this seeming benign component of the well-intentioned plan could represent a giant step on the way to the “high tech dystopia” of Silicon Valley barons and their national security state partners.

In May 2018, Klein became the Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University. The position was created “following a three-year, $3 million campaign…including a dozen foundations.” Among the “early and path breaking contributors,” according to Rutgers, was the Ford Foundation.

Contributions also poured in for the endowment from tycoons like Sheryl Sandberg, the billionaire chief operating officer of Facebook and advocate of corporate “Lean In” feminism; and Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul who was sentenced this March to 23 years in prison for first degree criminal sexual assault. According to Rutgers, Weinstein provided “a gift of $100,000 in honor of his late mother, who shared Gloria Steinem’s hopes for female equality.”

I had hoped to have a conversation with Klein, a former colleague at the Nation Institute, about her reflexive opposition to a documentary that advanced many of the same arguments that appeared in her past writings. Was the exclusive focus on carbon emissions by professional climate warriors not a blinkered approach that ignored the environmental damage inherent in producing still-unproven renewable technology? Did “cleantech” tycoons not have a vested interest in advancing a global transition to the renewable products their companies manufactured? And when she had clearly articulated the problems with billionaire-backed Big Green advocacy, why had Klein cast her lot with a political network that seemed to epitomize it?

My emails were met with an auto-reply informing me Klein was “off grid,” and referring me to her personal assistant.

According to Fox, high-profile climate warriors like McKibben and Klein had no interest in speaking to me about their opposition to the film because “it’s like four months ago, man, everybody’s moved on.”

Seeing green in Biden

By August, members of the professional climate advocacy network that saw its interests threatened by “Planet of the Humans” was preparing for a much more elaborate on-screen production that promised new opportunities.

In the weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention, climate justice organizations like the Sunrise Movement 501 c-4 which emerged in the shadow of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential run and condemned former Vice President Joseph Biden as a tool of the establishment suddenly changed their tune.

Flush with dark money from Democratic Party-aligned billionaires, Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash stated on July 14 – the day Biden released his clean energy plan: “It’s no secret that we’ve been critical of Vice President’s Biden’s plans and commitments in the past. Today, he’s responded to many of those criticisms: dramatically increasing the scale and urgency of investments… Our movement, alongside environmental justice communities and frontline workers, has taught Joe Biden to talk the talk.”

While it brands itself as a grassroots movement that has organized anti-establishment stunts putting centrist figures like Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on the spot, the Sunrise Movement was incubated with a grant from the Sierra Club, the Mike Bloomberg-backed juggernaut of Big Green organizing. Today, offices of the two organizations are located a floor apart in the same building in downtown Washington DC.

Ahead of the DNC, the Biden campaign introduced a $2 trillion plan pledge to invest heavily in renewable technology to achieve “a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.” The plan promised to erect 500 million solar panels in the next five years alongside 60,000 new wind turbines.

With the demand for solar plummeting due to the coronavirus pandemic, the prospect of gigantic government subsidies was music to the ears of the “cleantech” tycoons who sponsor Democratic Party-aligned climate advocacy organizations.

Many of these green millionaires and billionaires had feasted at the trough of Obama’s stimulus package, which was directly responsible for powering the rise of America’s solar industry. After promising upon his inauguration to invest $150 billion in “a new green energy business sector,” Obama doled out an eye-popping $4.9 billion in subsidies to Tesla’s Elon Musk and a $1.2 billion loan guarantee for Tom Dinwoodie’s SunPower US to construct the California Valley Solar Ranch. In June 2019, an “avian incident” caused a fire at the SunPower Solar Ranch project, impacting over 1200 acres and knocking out 84% of generating capacity for several weeks.

“Planet of the Humans” presented viewers with the disturbing story of the Ivanpah solar plant, a signature initiative in Obama’s green energy plan which was co-owned by Google. Gifted with $1.6 billion in loan guarantees and $600 million in federal tax credits, Ivanpah was built on 5.6 square miles of pristine public land close to California’s Mojave National Preserve. In its first year, the massive plant produced less than half its of its planned energy goal while burning over 6000 birds to death.

Because of the intermittency inherent to solar power, the gargantuan energy project has had to burn massive amounts of natural gas to keep the system primed when the sun is not shining. Despite its dependence on fossil fuel, Ivanpah still qualifies under state rules as a renewable plant.

“The bottom line is the public didn’t expect this project to consume this much natural gas,” David Lamfrom, California desert manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, told the local Press-Enterprise. “We did not have full knowledge that this was what we were signing up for.”

Even after the Obama administration poured billions of dollars into solar projects, solar energy output increased between 2008 and 2016 by just .88% as a total of American energy production.

Meanwhile, across the country, many new wind projects remain stalled due to community concerns about land destruction. In the home state of Green New Deal advocate Sen. Bernie Sanders, the only remaining wind project was canceled this January.

For raising questions about the efficacy and environmental cost of renewable projects like these, and proposing an explicitly anti-capitalist solution to the corporate destruction of the planet, the makers of “Planet of the Humans” were steamrolled by a network of professional climate activists, billionaire investors and industry insiders.

Now, with the Biden campaign promising a new flood of renewable subsidies and tax breaks under the auspices of a “clean” energy plan, the public remains in the dark about what it is signing up for. Even if the ambitious agenda fails to deliver any substantial environmental good, it promises a growing class of green investors another opportunity to do well."

"Emissions from 13 dairy firms match those of entire UK, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/15/emissions-from-13-dairy-firms-match-those-of-entire-uk-says-report,"The biggest dairy companies in the world have the same combined greenhouse gas emissions as the UK, the sixth biggest economy in the world, according to a new report.

The analysis shows the impact of the 13 firms on the climate crisis is growing, with an 11% increase in emissions in the two years after the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, largely due to consolidation in the sector. Scientific reports have shown that consumption of dairy, as well as meat, must be reduced significantly in rich nations to tackle the climate emergency.

The report, by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) in the US, also says the growth of giant dairy companies has helped force milk prices below the cost of production for the last decade, causing a crisis in rural livelihoods and requiring taxpayer subsidies to keep farmers afloat. The researchers say caps on production should be reintroduced to protect both the climate and small farmers.

“Unlike growing public scrutiny on fossil fuel companies, little public pressure exists to hold global meat and dairy corporations accountable for their emissions,” said Shefali Sharma, European director at IATP and report author. “Few of these companies are even reporting their emissions.”

“As governments ratchet up their climate goals, the rise of large-scale dairy and public incentives that further increase corporate dairy power, production and emissions must be stopped,” she said. “Rural livelihoods and our planet’s future depend on it.”

Dairy industry representatives said the report did not reflect the reality of the dairy sector. In a joint statement, Judith Bryans, president of the International Dairy Federation, and Donald Moore, executive director of the Global Dairy Platform, said: “The dairy sector is committed to producing nutritious foods in environmentally sound and responsible ways.”

“It’s very easy to put out a report that criticises and tries to paint a simple picture of a sector which doesn’t contain all of the nuances or realities of how the global dairy sector nourishes the world with nutrient-rich, safe foods and does so in a manner that strives for continued environmental improvements while providing livelihoods to a large percentage of the world’s population,” said Bryans and Moore.

A 2019 joint report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Global Dairy Platform said: “In order to limit temperature rise, the dairy sector must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and work towards a low-carbon future … There is a clear case for immediate and more ambitious action.”

It said: “The [dairy] sector’s emissions have increased by 18% between 2005 and 2015 because overall milk production has grown substantially by 30%. The good news is that there are many opportunities within the sector to limit climate change by reducing emissions. While there is some uncertainty about the size and timing of changes, it is certain that it is happening.” The report did not consider reducing production.

Bryans and Moore said: “[Dairy’s] rich nutrition helps populations, particularly in developing nations, avoid malnutrition and poor health outcomes.” The biggest global producers of milk are the European Union, India and the US.

The IATP report used the UN FAO’s global livestock environmental assessment model to assign emission levels to dairy produced in different regions. These were then applied to the companies’ production quantities as calculated by the IFCN dairy research network.

More than 90% of the corporate dairy industries’ emissions are produced by the cows themselves, mostly in the form of methane. Research shows all plant-based milks, such as soya and oat, result in far fewer emissions than dairy milk.

The IATP report found emissions from the big companies rose from 306m tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2015 to 338m tonnes in 2017. The UK’s annual emissions are 350m tonnes a year.

Consolidation in the dairy industry saw four out of five dairy farms close in the EU from 1981-2013, and 93% of family farms in dairy closing in the US since the 1970s. “You have to get bigger or get out,” said Sharma. “The key argument is this industry drives overproduction and low prices, which creates demand, and it has marketing power, which creates demand. Demand doesn’t just happen by accident.”

“There is growing support for supply management, a crucial policy that could address dairy’s twin crises. It prevents overproduction, balances supply and demand and stabilises prices,” she said."

"KFC's Plant-Based ""Chicken"" Sold Out in 5 Hours—people are beginning to realize our meat consumption is unsustainable",https://www.engadget.com/amp/2019/08/27/kfc-beyond-fried-chicken-popular/,"KFC's plant-based 'chicken' sold out in five hours

People like Beyond Meat's alternative, apparently.

There's little doubt that plant-based meat substitutes have been popular, but when's the last time they triggered the kind of frenzies associated with movie aficionados and sneaker hypebeasts? Today, apparently. Beyond Meat and KFC have revealed that their Beyond Fried Chicken test in Atlanta sold out in less than five hours on August 27th, with lines ""wrapped around the restaurant"" from the moment the store opened. Restaurants only have so much food to go around in general, but this was apparently no mean feat -- KFC sold as much of the meatless 'chicken' as it typically sells popcorn chicken in a week.

KFC plans to study the results of the test to decide what happens next, which could include a larger test or a full-fledged rollout. Although it didn't say what criteria would be involved, it's not necessarily a matter of looking at the lineups -- KFC likely wants signs that people liked Beyond Fried Chicken enough to come back, not just that they were willing to give it a try. The rush to track down Popeye's coveted sandwich might have helped KFC's chances by putting people in the mood for chicken, even if it's the simulated kind.

Yes, this is an opportunity for KFC and Beyond to toot their collective horn. If it does lead to an expanded rollout, though, it could represent more evidence that plant-based meat replacements have broad appeal outside of burgers. They're still far from ubiquitous at this stage, but they could soon be common enough that it's really just a question of whose meat-free meal you're eating."
Canada's last intact ice shelf broke off. It took our research station with it,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/14/canadas-last-intact-ice-shelf-broke-off-it-took-our-research-station-with-it,"Researchers studying the area in the Arctic for years describe the day of the calving event – and where they go from here

In August, Adrienne White – an ice analyst at the Canadian Ice Service who monitors the Canadian Arctic for changes in sea ice – was reviewing satellite imagery when she spotted something remarkable. The enormous Milne ice shelf, which was the last intact ice shelf in Canada and which White had studied closely before as a PhD student, was dissolving.

A huge chunk larger than Manhattan, roughly 43% of the shelf, broke off in one piece. And as it collapsed into the ocean, it took with it much of the equipment her former colleagues had left there.

“It is lucky that we were not on the ice shelf when this happened,” one colleague, Derek Mueller, wrote in a blogpost following the discovery. “Our camp area and instruments were all destroyed in this event.”

Mueller had been studying a channel that ran below the surface of the Milne ice shelf, like a river. In 2017, a team of researchers discovered scallops, sponges, worms and other organisms living some 20 meters deep, inside the ice shelf. Animals have been found living beneath ice shelves before, but never – to Mueller and his colleagues’ knowledge – inside of one.

Mueller is one of Canada’s leading ice shelf experts, along with Luke Copland, who supervised White’s PhD. Together and separately, the three have been studying the Arctic for years. They had observed rifts appearing over the Milne ice shelf throughout their careers. Still, the breakup – known as a calving event – is significant. Copland believe ice shelves are “a canary in the coalmine” in the climate crisis, given that they are especially susceptible to atmospheric changes.

We spoke to them about what that day was like, and where they go from here.

How did you first learn of the calving event?

Adrienne White: At the Canadian Ice Service, we use satellite imagery to chart sea ice in Canadian waters. We also use this imagery to monitor glaciers and ice shelves for calving events that can produce large ice islands. The day I discovered the Milne ice shelf calving event was a typical day; I came into work and was looking along the coastline of Ellesmere Island [to which the ice shelf was connected] for any changes; over the previous week, I’d noticed there was a lot of open water in the area, which can lead to destabilization.

Looking first at the optical imagery, the same type of imagery you would see on Google Earth, I could see that there was a darker area on the Milne, but there were a lot of clouds on the image that I couldn’t see through. Then I used radar satellite imagery, which can penetrate clouds, and with that we were able to clearly see the ice islands were separating from the ice shelf, and that the calving event was taking place.

What was your first reaction?

Derek Mueller: Shock and sadness, in some ways. It’s like hearing bad news. It’s not an easy thing to get used to.

White: I was really surprised. We think of these as semi-permanent features. But the breakup of these ice shelves is really quite inevitable at this point; along the coast of northern Ellesmere Island, we’re seeing open water and warmer temperatures almost consistently every summer.

Luke Copland: I got a text from Adrienne – I remember it clearly – and it just said: “The Milne ice shelf is gone.” I saw it and thought, ‘Crap, is that real?’ We’d both spent a lot of time working and living on the ice shelf, flying around it, studying it, so I texted her back and she described the process and the timing.

Did you see it coming?

Mueller: All of the other ice shelves had broken up in past years, so it wasn’t a question of if for this particular ice shelf. It was a question of when.

Copland: If you look at the changes [over time], we’ve lost more than 90% of ice shelves in the last hundred years. We’d seen increased melting on the surface and the bottom [of the Milne], as well as long-term thinning. So we knew things were changing. Still, this ice shelf is huge, it’s bigger than large cities are, and it’s very strange to look at a satellite image one day and then look at [the same area] the next day, and the thing doesn’t exist any more.

White: I always thought that the Milne was one of the more stable of the ice shelves; we had seen major breakups from the neighboring Serson and Peterson ice shelves, but the Milne seemed less susceptible to breakup. Part of my PhD was looking at what made it so stable, [including] the fact that it was so much thicker and attached to the walls of this fjord.

That being said, it did have large fractures going across it that had been widening over the past few years. And we had seen the southern edge, the part of the ice shelf at the back of the fjord, starting to melt away more and more each year. Still, it was a shock to see the thickest, strongest part of the ice shelf break apart in this one big piece.

Did you ever think you’d lose your equipment to an event like this?

Mueller: It’s one of those things: We need the data year-round and we can’t stay there year-round, so it’s always a risk. You could put a weather station on a tripod on a glacier and it could fall over. There’s lots of instruments floating around the Arctic that people [had] put out. We got two full years of data from ours, so we count ourselves lucky in that sense.

Does this change your plans to study the area?

White: Absolutely not. It only shows us how important it is to continue monitoring this coastline and acquiring imagery in this specific area at even higher resolution

Copland: We’re shifting more towards [studying] satellite images. A colleague of mine actually died [in the field]; he was one of the world leaders studying glaciers in the Arctic, and he fell through a crevasse on the Greenland ice sheet. And it seems that that crevasse is filled with water, which is ultimately the result of climate change.

There’s also been a shift over the last few years to studying [the Arctic] by helicopter. There’s so many measures that we can’t make unless we’re in the field; for example, we can’t really measure how thick the ice is from space. Moving forward, we’re still planning fieldwork, but being very careful and planning around safety.

Mueller: The ice shelf is still half there. Our key study site on the ice shelf was lost, but we can find another study area potentially.

Is it too late to save Canada’s remaining ice shelves from further breakup?

Copland: For ice shelves, we can lose them very quickly; when they break up, that piece of the ice shelf is gone, it floats away. That takes a day. But to form an ice shelf, it takes hundreds to thousands of years, because you need a gradual buildup of snow and ice. You need a cold climate for centuries to form an ice shelf, but to lose one, you lose them immediately.

White: This is really an area that has changed from [once] being completely ice-covered. You [used to] have old sea ice attached to the coast and ice shelves filling fjords and bays. Now, every year, we’ve seen open water along the entire coast of Ellesmere Island. The entire icescape has changed.

Mueller: I always have to say yes, it’s too late. Ice shelves were already vulnerable to change. But the action we take now will prevent this – or mitigate it, anyway – in the future, in other places. It’s critically important that we heed these warnings. If we can make a change and hit these Paris climate accord targets, there is opportunity."
Study: Most trees alive today won't be able to survive in the climate expected in 40 years,http://www.rapidshift.net/most-trees-alive-today-wont-be-able-to-survive-in-the-climate-expected-in-40-years/,"Mass forest die-offs will proliferate and expand. The trend toward more extreme heat waves and droughts is lethal for forests.

At the current pace of warming, much of the world will be inhospitable to forests as we know them within decades. The extinction of some tree species by direct or indirect action of drought and high temperatures is certain. And some recent research suggests that, in 40 years, none of the trees alive today will be able to survive the projected climate, Brodribb said.

“Nobody predicted the coral bleaching scenario. If a similar thing evolves with forests, that is pretty catastrophic,” he said. “We’re at a point where we can see the process, we can predict it. It’s time to start making some noise about it. We can’t afford to sit on our hands.”

An emerging megadrought has already weakened and killed hundreds of millions of trees, including Rocky Mountain lodgepole and piñon pines, as well as aspens.

Tim Brodribb has been measuring all the different ways global warming kills trees for the past 20 years. With a microphone, he says, you can hear them take their last labored breaths. During blistering heat waves and droughts, air bubbles invade their delicate, watery veins, cracking them open with an audible pop. And special cameras can film the moment their drying leaves split open in a lightning bolt pattern, disrupting photosynthesis.

“We really need to be able to hear these poor trees scream. These are living things that are suffering. We need to listen to them,” said Brodribb, a plant physiologist at the University of Tasmania who led a recent study that helps identify exactly when, where and how trees succumb to heat and dryness.

The study, published April 17 in the journal Science, reviewed the last 10 years of research on tree mortality, concluding that forests are in big trouble if global warming continues at the present pace. Most trees alive today won’t be able to survive in the climate expected in 40 years, Brodribb said. The negative impacts of warming and drying are already outpacing the fertilization benefits of increased carbon dioxide.

Trees and forests can be compared with corals and reefs, he said. Both are slow-growing and long-lived systems that can’t easily move or adapt in a short time to rapid warming and both have relatively inflexible damage thresholds. For corals, a global tipping point was reached from 2014 to 2016. In record-warm oceans, reefs around the world bleached and died.

The detailed new information and modeling on how water stress kills trees suggests there is a similar drought threshold for tree mortality, beyond which forests could also perish on a global scale, he said.

“Nobody predicted the coral bleaching scenario. If a similar thing evolves with forests, that is pretty catastrophic,” he said. “We’re at a point where we can see the process, we can predict it. It’s time to start making some noise about it. We can’t afford to sit on our hands.”

No CO2 Greening

The new paper shows that the hope that rising carbon dioxide would green the planet is probably misplaced. Studies have shown that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere boosts photosynthesis, spurring plant growth by chemically combining the carbon with water and ground nutrients.

But there will “probably be more browning than greening,” said University of Arizona forest scientist Dave Breshears, who was not involved in the new research.

“The review ends on a hard note, with high confidence that we’re going to have a lot of impacts with hotter droughts in the future,” he said. Mass forest die-offs will proliferate and expand. The trend toward more extreme heat waves and droughts is lethal for forests. But despite the grim outlook, it’s important not to paint an entirely desperate picture, he said.

“It’s our choice of how much worse we want it to get. Every little bit of reduction of warming can have a positive effect. We can reduce the tree die-off. Are we going to make the choices to try and minimize that?“

Breshears has used tree mortality data to try and make near real-time projections for tree die-offs in the Southwest. This would help adapt forest management, including firefighting, to rapidly changing conditions in a region where an emerging megadrought has already weakened and killed hundreds of millions of trees, including Rocky Mountain lodgepole and piñon pines, as well as aspens.

Elsewhere, African cedars and acacias are dying, South America’s Amazon rainforest is struggling, and junipers are declining in the Middle East. In Spain and Greece, global warming is shriveling oaks, and even in moist, temperate northern Europe, unusual droughts have stressed vast stands of beech forests.

At the current pace of warming, much of the world will be inhospitable to forests as we know them within decades. The extinction of some tree species by direct or indirect action of drought and high temperatures is certain. And some recent research suggests that, in 40 years, none of the trees alive today will be able to survive the projected climate, Brodribb said.

“That’s one of the potential scenarios, and we need to know if that’s right. We have to establish the consequences of rising temperatures unequivocally for policy makers,” he said.

The stakes are high, since trees are the foundation for terrestrial biodiversity and because they capture and store about one-third of human-caused CO2 emissions within their dense wood frames. A global loss of forests could lead to a surge in heat-trapping carbon dioxide, causing more warming, and would also eliminate habitat for countless other animals, plants and fungi, with a rippling effect that reaches humans.

“The closer people are to the land and living at subsistence level, it’s going to hit those people hardest,” Breshears said.

Shifting Forests

Forests in warm and semi-arid regions may suffer the most in the decades ahead, but there may also be big changes in store for cooler, wetter regions. Some forests that need a lot of moisture could dry up with just a small decline in precipitation because rapid warming magnifies the loss of moisture from soils.

Even if forests don’t die, they will fundamentally change. A recent study published in the journal Global Change Biology zoomed in on the evergreen forests in the Stubai Valley in Tirol, Austria. At 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) of global warming, which will be reached during the last few decades of this century, the dense stands of spruce and fir will change to a mix of oaks and pines, more like forests on the drier southern fringes of the Alps in Italy, the projections showed.

“We found that at warming levels above 2 degrees Celsius a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state,” the researchers wrote. Even warming that corresponds with the current policy goals of the Paris climate agreement could “result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems. Overshooting the climate targets could be dangerous, because “ecological impacts can be irreversible at millennial time scales once a tipping point has been crossed.”

Forests on a Knife Edge

The new paper reinforces the observational evidence that global warming has pushed many of the world’s forests to a knife edge, said University of Utah forest researcher Bill Anderegg. In the West, you can’t drive on a mountain highway without seeing how global warming affects forests, from wildfires to die-offs caused by beetles or other pathogens, he said.

In some areas, researchers have documented how forests are struggling to grow back. For example, in parts of the Four Corners region, hardly any new piñon pines have sprouted to replace trees killed by beetles in the early 2000s because it’s too warm for seeds to take hold and grow.

And older trees conserve their energy to survive drought and fend off beetles rather than producing seeds. As result, there were almost no piñon pine nuts to be harvested last fall on the Navajo Nation, where the nutritious nuts have been part of cultural tradition for centuries.

“The risks of climate change to forests are substantial and going up faster than we thought,” Anderegg said. The new physiological models of trees and ecosystems helps pinpoint exactly when and where forests are vulnerable, with the aim of making credible forecasts for forests in this century, giving landowners and policymakers more useful tools, he added.

Accurate new information is also valuable for climate policy, because many national carbon-reduction targets based on the Paris climate agreement include tree planting as a key tool to reduce emissions. But rapid forest change and catastrophic die-offs could put a monkey wrench in those plans. And in addition to the direct tree-killing effects of heat and drought, interactions with other disturbances like insects and other pathogens will magnify forest die-offs, he said.

Restoration and Resilience?

University of Montana forest ecologist Diana Six said the conclusions in the new research weren’t surprising because she’s always been skeptical of the projected beneficial effects of carbon dioxide triggering photosynthesis in plants.

“I was always amazed by the early predictions for enhanced growth of forests, especially in the West,” she said. Many of the models only included warmer temperatures or higher CO2 effects. The projections were made mainly by economists who assumed that only temperatures and CO2 affect tree growth, she added.

“No one seemed to consider water. With warmer temperatures and a longer growing season comes greater demand for water and we are getting less, not more, in most cases. That should have been a big red flag,” she said.

Six’s research focuses on tree-killing bugs, and she said it’s clear how global warming and insect devastation fit together. Heat causes drought-weakened trees to release different chemicals from healthy trees, and the bugs “are incredibly good at finding them,” she said.

And global warming has weakened a lot of trees in the West.

“Even with average rainfall it’s still a drought for trees now much of the time because of increased temperatures. Trees are tough, but they can only take so much. Some of the forests look like they’re fine, but they’re not, they are already near thresholds,” she said.

Some mature trees can survive conditions that aren’t supportive for them anymore. They have deep roots and can hunker down in survival mode for decades in dry conditions, but that doesn’t mean conditions exist for new growth. And not all old trees can survive.

“Some recent research shows that a lot of our forests may be genetically maladapted to the changing climate. We’re losing big trees faster and regeneration is not keeping up. This is not a sustainable pattern that we’re seeing,” she said.

But there is also critical information to be gleaned from the trees that aren’t killed.

“The trees that survive are very different genetically and chemically, and they also grow very differently. In some cases it’s the slower-growing trees that survive,” she said. That’s important information for forest restoration and resilience planning, she added.

“There are ways we can help our forests adapt, with space, sizing and composition. But eventually, you really have to get at adaptation. You have to get trees on the landscape that can survive in new conditions,” she said.

That would include leaving the few trees that survived massive beetle outbreaks, rather than cutting them down during the salvage logging of beetle-killed trees. Often, the loggers are eager to harvest the remaining live trees because they are worth more, but Six said it’s exactly those survivors that could help seed a new forest that’s more resistant to insects and warming.

The survivors may hold some of the secrets to ensuring that at least some forests will survive human-caused global warming. And they show that there is already some natural adaptation under way. The die-offs are natural selection working on a large scale, and for some trees, that might be enough to trigger an evolutionarily adaptive response, she said. After all, conifers have a huge amount of genetic diversity and have survived drastic climate change on a geological time scale over millions of years.

“Some of the things we are seeing are dreadful and devastating, but there are studies showing trees can adapt quite rapidly on an evolutionary level. But if we keep cranking up the temperature, there is never going to be enough adaptation possible,” she said.

What inspired your interest in plant science?

When I was 11 years old we moved from a grey industrial city near Manchester in the UK to the leafy paradise of Tasmania; I think after that baptism of greenery I really fell in love with trees. At university I realized that we did not know much about these magnificent organisms that so cleverly soak up the sunshine to power life on earth. Questions about how plants live, what makes them thrive and what makes them suffer and die seemed (seem) like the most important questions on Earth to answer. In my last year as an undergraduate at university I took a course with Professor Bob Hill who inspired me with tales of Australia’s transformation from rainforest to desert over millions of years of climate change: these evolutionary processes continue to fascinate me and are more relevant today than ever. I ended up doing a PhD with Bob, working on the physiological evolution of conifers.

Why did you decide to pursue a career in research?

I have enjoyed the freedom of not being much of a capitalist. This has allowed me to make decisions largely based upon interest rather than remuneration. Figuring out how plants work is the thing that interested me most, so when faced with choices I always chose research (rarely the most lucrative option). Thus, I am incredibly fortunate that research ultimately became my career, but it was more of a gravitational process than a career decision. I have benefitted enormously from fabulous fellowship programmes in the United States and Australia that continue to enable young researchers to manage their own research projects and follow their own passion and intuition. I believe that in an increasingly commercial world it is critically important to maintain an unencumbered pathway for ‘blue sky’ research.

What motivates you on a day‐to‐day basis?

The thrill of discovery is a great motivator for me. Plants guard their secrets well, so it is very exciting when you find a way into their world. It is easy to get carried away sometimes when you think you are on the brink of something new; I have to force myself to go home for dinner, or to go the beach for a surf and think about nothing for a while. I also get a tremendous amount of satisfaction when my students or postdoctoral students discover new things. I spend a lot of time peering over their shoulders in the laboratory. I like to think I am a motivating force, but I am sure that sometimes I may provide more advice than is desired.

Box 1.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Plant Science at the University of Tasmania (Australia) (UTAS). Staying put, I received my PhD at UTAS in 1997. After a year postdoctoral study with my supervisor (Professor Bob Hill), I spent 3 years working as a postdoctoral student with Missy Holbrook at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA, USA). I won a Putnam Fellowship at the Arnold Arboretum (Boston, MA, USA) for a further 2 years. After this I returned to Tasmania in 2005 and was awarded two successive fellowships funded by the Australian Research Council. I was awarded a permanent position at the University of Tasmania in 2017. My current interests include all aspects of plant hydraulics, plant mortality, and links between hydraulic and photosynthetic function including stomatal physiology and anatomical associations. I continue to look into evolutionary patterns in water relations and gas exchange physiology through the different vascular plant lineages.

Is there anyone that you consider to be a role model?

Creativity is an important part of scientific discovery, and I admire those who are able to combine lateral thinking, imagination and experimental design to reveal new concepts. I remember reading a paper by John Sperry and Mel Tyree during my PhD and being so impressed that these scientists could imagine that cavitation in the transpiration stream was a limiter of plant survival: it seemed such a lateral concept at the time. I have always greatly admired Graham Farquhar (Australian National University, Canberra), his ability to come up with so many good ideas over his 40+ year career is inspirational, and he is still as keen as ever. The passion for discovery in science that I see among my colleagues is something I respect deeply. The dedication of people like Missy Holbrook (my first postdoctoral supervisor at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA) and Jennifer Powers (the queen of dry tropical forest ecology), who successfully combine scientific discovery and motherhood, provides a tremendous role model for women in science.

What are your favourite New Phytologist papers of recent years, and why?

I just finished writing a New Phytologist Editorial with Nate McDowell and Andrea Nardini about hydraulics (McDowell et al., 2019). During this process it was impressive to see how many critical hydraulics papers have appeared in New Phytologist since the dawn of hydraulic science (c. 40 years ago). So it is hard to pick a favourite, but I really like all Taylor Feild’s papers about early angiosperm evolution (see for example the Tansley review Feild & Arens, 2005). The paper on pit anatomy by Frederik Lens and colleagues is a corker (Lens et al., 2011), and Max Larter’s paper on the evolution of drought tolerance in the conifer Callitris is great (Larter et al., 2017); they are such amazing plants.

What is your favourite plant, and why?

This is a tricky question, there are so many plants that I love. Among the conifers, I think that the Fijian Acmopyle sahniana is my favourite. This extraordinary ghost of a conifer (its leaves are totally white due to epicuticular wax) is nearly extinct. In order to find this species during my PhD, I had to find an old village chief in Fiji who knew where the plants were, then walk 13 hours through the jungle to discover them hidden on a high ridge in cloud forest. I think we were among the first people to see them in cone. Callitris is another favourite conifer because it has unbelievably bulletproof xylem, and Parasitaxus because it is such a freak of a red parasitic conifer hidden in the hills of New Caledonia. I am very fond of the moss Dawsonia, a giant of a plant that can grow up to 1 m tall in Papua New Guinea; it is the Sequoia of mosses. The lycophyte Selaginella pallescens is very cool. It covers the forest floor in parts of Costa Rica, invisible during the dry season, until it rains, then 5 minutes later it transforms the entire forest floor from grey to verdant green. Among the angiosperms, I really like Nothofagus, not only because it is beautiful genus of trees, containing Australia’s only winter deciduous species, but also because it links together the ancient biogeography of the southern continents.

Stomatal Closure during Leaf Dehydration, Correlation with Other Leaf Physiological Traits

Abstract

The question as to what triggers stomatal closure during leaf desiccation remains controversial. This paper examines characteristics of the vascular and photosynthetic functions of the leaf to determine which responds most similarly to stomata during desiccation. Leaf hydraulic conductance (K leaf ) was measured from the relaxation kinetics of leaf water potential (Ψ l ), and a novel application of this technique allowed the response of K leaf to Ψ l to be determined. These “vulnerability curves” show that K leaf is highly sensitive to Ψ l and that the response of stomatal conductance to Ψ l is closely correlated with the response of K leaf to Ψ l . The turgor loss point of leaves was also correlated with K leaf and stomatal closure, whereas the decline in PSII quantum yield during leaf drying occurred at a lower Ψ l than stomatal closure. These results indicate that stomatal closure is primarily coordinated with K leaf . However, the close proximity of Ψ l at initial stomatal closure and initial loss of K leaf suggest that partial loss of K leaf might occur regularly, presumably necessitating repair of embolisms.

Stomata appear in the fossil record approximately 400 million years ago (Edwards et al., 1998) at approximately the same time as the evolution of an internal water conducting system in plants. Stomatal evolution is believed to be a response to selective pressure to optimize the ratio of CO 2 uptake to water lost during photosynthesis (Raven, 2002). The evolution of internal conduits for water transport added a level of complexity to optimizing gas exchange during photosynthesis, because of the dependence of water supply capacity upon the water potential in the plant (Sperry et al., 2002). This complexity is evidenced by the variable effects of leaf water potential (Ψ l ) and vapor pressure deficit on stomatal movements among species. Although stomatal aperture responds predictably to guard cell turgor (Franks et al., 1995), the relationships between guard cell turgor and either transpiration (E) or mesophyll turgor are still hypothetical (Buckley and Mott, 2002). Amid mechanistic debate as to the process of stomatal closure, the fundamental question of why stomata close remains unanswered. Given that stomata may predate the evolution of xylem (Edwards et al., 1998; Raven, 2002), it is appropriate to question whether it is vascular or other tissues that provide the trigger for stomatal closure.

We focus here on the question of what sets the point of stomatal closure in leaves. That is to say which aspect of a plant’s physiology is sufficiently sensitive to decreasing Ψ l that it requires stomata to be closed and photosynthesis sacrificed to protect from loss of function and damage. A key assumption here is that traits responsible for determining the stomatal response to leaf desiccation are coordinated with physiological characters dictating the sensitivity of the metabolic or transport machinery of the plant to water stress. Candidates for these coordinated traits are likely be located in or near the leaf, because transduction of signals from far upstream of the leaves is generally slow relative to the half-time for stomatal responses to perturbations in leaf water balance (Tardieu and Davies, 1993). Additionally, it would be expected that among these traits, adaptation to sustain lower Ψ l would come at a significant cost. Features such as the vulnerability of leaf xylem to cavitation and the resistance of leaf cells to collapse fulfill these criteria in that they are prone to failure (either structural or functional) under conditions of low water content and are both costly to augment. However, it is clear that photosynthesis in most species becomes irreversibly depressed when leaf relative water content (RWC) falls to around 70% (Lawlor and Cornic, 2002), and thus the resistance of the photosynthetic apparatus to desiccation is also a potential trigger for stomatal closure.

In this paper, we examine the vascular and photosynthetic apparatus of the leaf to test whether stomatal closure is correlated with the water-stress tolerance of different leaf tissues or functions. This work follows a number of studies that have demonstrated similarity between the response of both stomatal conductance (g s ) and stem xylem cavitation to decreasing Ψ l (Salleo et al., 2000; Hubbard et al., 2001; Cochard et al., 2002). It is likely that this correlation between stomatal closure and xylem cavitation will be most prominent in the leaf, given that leaf minor veins appear more prone to cavitation than stems (Nardini et al., 2001), and that leaves represent a large proportion of the whole plant hydraulic resistance (Nardini, 2001; Brodribb et al., 2002). Surprisingly there have been few studies that have quantified the effect of Ψ l on leaf hydraulic conductance (K leaf ) in woody plants (Nardini et al., 2001), probably due to technical difficulties in measuring the hydraulic conductance of the leaf.

Here, we quantify the relationship between Ψ l on K leaf by examining the kinetics of Ψ l relaxation in rehydrating leaves. A number of studies have examined the dynamics of pressure equilibration in leaves to estimate components of their hydraulic resistance. For example, Cruiziat et al. (1980) and Tyree et al. (1981) estimated K leaf from the kinetics of water flow into dehydrated sunflower leaves, whereas Nobel and Jordan (1983) used the time constant for water potential equilibration following overpressurization to estimate leaf mesophyll transfer resistance. In this study, we measured the rate of relaxation of Ψ l during the rehydration of leaves desiccated to different water potentials, enabling the quantitative determination of leaf vulnerability to cavitation…

Plants can only function on land by virtue of beautifully efficient systems that regulate water transport and evaporation. My research focuses on how water transport and water use have evolved together in plants. The fundamental questions my research addresses are

How do characteristics of the plant vascular system limit productivity? How does xylem and stomatal behaviour limit survival and distribution of plant species? How have the performance of hydraulic and stomatal systems changed through evolutionary time? How do hydraulic characteristics determine species ecology?

** Developing answers to these questions provides critical knowledge for diverse applications, ranging from understanding the impacts of past and future climate change, to developing more productive crop varieties.

They wanted the campus experience, but their colleges sent them home to learn online during the coronavirus pandemic. Now, students at more than 25 U.S. universities are filing lawsuits against their schools demanding partial refunds on tuition and campus fees, saying they’re not getting the caliber of education they were promised.

The suits reflect students’ growing frustration with online classes that schools scrambled to create as the coronavirus forced campuses across the nation to close last month. The suits say students should pay lower rates for the portion of the term that was offered online, arguing that the quality of instruction is far below the classroom experience.

Colleges, though, reject the idea that refunds are in order. Students are learning from the same professors who teach on campus, officials have said, and they’re still earning credits toward their degrees. Schools insist that, after being forced to close by their states, they’re still offering students a quality education.

Grainger Rickenbaker, a freshman who filed a class-action lawsuit against Drexel University in Philadelphia, said the online classes he’s been taking are poor substitutes for classroom learning. There’s little interaction with students or professors, he said, and some classes are being taught almost entirely through recorded videos, with no live lecture or discussion.

“You just feel a little bit diminished,” said Rickenbaker, 21, of Charleston, South Carolina. “It’s just not the same experience I would be getting if I was at the campus.”

Other students report similar experiences elsewhere. A complaint against the University of California, Berkeley, says some professors are simply uploading assignments, with no video instruction at all. A case against Vanderbilt University says class discussion has been stymied and the “quality and academic rigor of courses has significantly decreased.”

In a case against Purdue University, a senior engineering student said the closure has prevented him from finishing his senior project, building an airplane. “No online course can simulate the applicable, real-world experience” he hoped to gain from the project, the complaint says.

Class-action lawsuits demanding tuition refunds have been filed against at least 26 colleges, targeting prestigious private universities, including Brown, Columbia and Cornell, along with big public schools, including Michigan State, Purdue and the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Some of the suits draw attention to schools’ large financial reserves, saying colleges are unfairly withholding refunds even while they rest on endowments that often surpass $1 billion.

Several colleges declined to comment on the lawsuits, but some said students have continued to get what they paid for.

Ken McConnellogue, a spokesman for the University of Colorado, said it’s disappointing that people have been so quick to file lawsuits only weeks into the pandemic. He said the suits appear to be driven by a small number of “opportunistic” law firms.

“Our faculty have been working extremely hard to deliver an academic product that’s got the same high standards, high-quality academic rigor as what they would deliver in the classroom,” he said. “It’s different, no doubt. And it’s not ideal. We all would prefer to have students on our campuses, but at the same time, we’re in the middle of a global pandemic here.”

Officials at Michigan State said students are still taking classes taught by qualified faculty, and the school is still offering tutoring services, academic advising, faculty office hours and library services.

“We don’t negate that this has been a difficult time for our university, especially for our students,” Emily Guerrant, a Michigan State spokeswoman, said in a statement. The school has taken on new costs to move instruction online, she added, but “we have maintained our commitment to providing meaningful and robust learning experiences at no additional cost to our Spartans.”

Officials at Drexel University said the school has continued to provide a “broad spectrum of academic offerings and support” while students learn remotely.

Lawyers representing students, however, say the refunds are a matter of fairness.

“You cannot keep money for services and access if you aren’t actually providing it,” said Roy Willey, a lawyer for the Anastopoulo Law Firm in South Carolina, which is representing students in more than a dozen cases. “If we’re truly going to be all in this together, the universities have to tighten their belts and refund the money back to students and families who really need it.”

Willey said his office has received hundreds of inquiries from students looking to file suits, and his firm is looking into dozens of possible cases. Other firms taking on similar cases say they’re also seeing a wave of demand from students and parents who say they deserve refunds.

Along with tuition, the cases also seek refunds for fees that students paid to access gyms, libraries, labs and other buildings that are now closed. All told, the complaints seek refunds that could add up to several thousand dollars per student at some schools.

The lawsuits ask courts to answer a thorny question that has come to the fore as universities shift classes online: whether there’s a difference in value between online instruction and the traditional classroom. Proponents of online education say it can be just as effective, and universities say they’ve done everything they can to create rigorous online classes in a matter of weeks.

But some of the complaints maintain that the college experience is about more than course credits. They say there’s value to the personal interaction students get with faculty and classmates, both in the classroom and out. Willey adds that colleges themselves often charge lower rates for online classes, which he says is a reflection of their value.

“The tuition price speaks for itself,” he said. “These students decided to go to in-person, on-campus universities. They could have chosen to go to online colleges and earn their degree that way, but they didn’t.”

Even before the first lawsuits were filed, demands for tuition refunds had been spreading. Students at dozens of schools have started petitions calling for refunds as online classes left them underwhelmed. Scores of schools have returned portions of housing and dining fees, but few if any have agreed to return any share of tuition.

At the University of Chicago, hundreds of students signed a letter saying they will refuse to pay this term’s tuition, which was due April 29, unless the school reduces tuition by 50% and keeps it at that level during the crisis.

Colleges counter that the coronavirus has put them under sharp financial strain, too. Some estimate that they could lose up to $1 billion this year as they brace for downturns in student enrollment, state funding and research grants. Some have already announced layoffs and furloughs as they work to offset losses.

But the lawsuits say it’s not fair to pass those losses on to students. Jennifer Kraus-Czeisler, a lawyer for the New York firm Milberg Phillips Grossman, which is representing several students, said colleges have a duty to return fees for services they aren’t providing.

“We’re not disparaging the schools for closing. They did what was appropriate,” she said. “But they’re profiting at the expense of students. It just seems unconscionable.”"
"“Our only option is to stop pretending that we are ‘going green.’ To survive as a species, we must switch to local production and forget globalized growth. The economic growth paradigm of neoliberal capitalism is incompatible with human survival, especially for life-supporting ecosystems.”",https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/05/22/10c-above-baseline/,"by

Earth at 10°C above pre-industrial is unimaginable. It’s a deadly horrifying thought, but as shall be explained herein, it should not be dismissed out of hand.

The following story might be labeled as reckless, and it might be criticized as a fearmongering piece of journalism and probably will be. Nevertheless, “10C Above Baseline” explores a dystopian world envisioned by John Doyle, Sustainable Development Policy Coordinator of the European Commission in Brussels.

***

Doyle’s thesis of a 10C world, within current lifetimes, is based upon sober-minded analysis. Of course, it envisions a planet of few or maybe no humans. Granted, it is hard to believe, very hard to accept.

Whereas, the Paris Agreement of 2015 officially set goals amongst the nations of the world to employ mitigation measures to hold global temperatures to 2C but preferably 1.5C above pre-industrial, which is mid 18th century (1750s), except for IPCC measurement purposes, which are markedly different from the 18th century pre-industrial baseline, to wit: ”The baseline period from which climate change is expressed has also moved on (a common baseline period of 1986–2005 is used throughout, consistent with the 2006 start-point for the RCP scenario).” (Source: AR5 Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Hmm!

Meanwhile, 1.5C has become a cause célèbre among climate activists. But, there’s a rub: In order to stay below 1.5C, greenhouse gas emissions, like CO2, need to fall off a cliff, decreasing by 15% per year, starting in year 2020. (Doyle)

Categorically, that’s impossible to achieve for a host of reasons.

Not so long ago the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report about 2C versus 1.5C. Its findings were grim, namely: At 2˚C (3.6˚F) rather than at 1.5˚C (2.7˚F) the danger to ecosystems increases several fold.

As things stand, the world has a comfort zone of 1.5C to 2.0C with 1.5C the clear preference. But still, at 2.0C all kinds of bells and whistles go off, e.g., (1) severe heat events increase by 2.6xs (2) the Wet Bulb Temperature WBT-impact (3) 2xs vertebrate species loss and (4) 90% of coral reefs gone for good, etc., etc., etc. as key ecosystems that support and originate life suffer.

Keeping in mind (lest you forget) there is no Planet B.

So then, what of 10C?

John Doyle, a climate resilience analyst, has studied the climate system and discussed findings at a UN Aid Agencies meeting, John Doyle, Sustainable Development Policy Coordinator of the European Commission, Information Society and Media Directorate-General.

Doyle is working on mainstreaming Sustainable Development in the Information Society Directorate General with special emphasis on business partnerships to address energy and climate security.

A synopsis of Doyle’s disturbing analysis and speech follows herein:

One of the video power-point headlines boldly proclaims: “Science… We’re heading fast for 10C degrees, 4C is extinction.”

Doyle: “Roughly speaking, you’ve been told that we may be heading for 1.5c or 2c degrees above pre-industrial temperature. That’s not true. That’s basically very old science, and it’s essentially inaccurate. There isn’t a single independent scientist of the world that would support that position now. We’re actually heading for 10 degrees warming that could happen within 20 to 30 years. And, on the way to 10 degrees, we pass 4 degrees. Now, four degrees is interesting because that’s extinction for our species. So keep that one in mind. I’m not just making this up.”

All of which prompts a question: Along the way to 10C, when does 4C happen? If 10C is on the docket within 20-30 years, as explained by Doyle, then it’s probably safe to assume 4C within 8-15 years. Regrettably, that’s within the lifetimes of pretty much the entire world population now approaching 8B. Talk about impact!

Predicting a 10C uplift in global temperatures beyond pre-industrial is a stunning proposition, absolutely stunning! Indeed, his speech is a death-defying prognostication, but truth be told, nobody will believe it!

A review of literature of other climate scientists adds some dimension to Doyle’s work, to wit: In December 2019, the Potsdam Institute For Climate Research, one of the world’s premier climate research orgs, caused an international stir with a paper published in Nature: “Climate Tipping Points – Too Risky To Bet Against.”

A very interesting statement is found within the Potsdam paper, as follows: “The Earth system has been unstable across multiple timescales before, under relatively weak forcing caused by changes in Earth’s orbit. Now we are strongly forcing the system, with atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature increasing at rates that are an order of magnitude higher than those during the most recent de-glaciation… Atmospheric CO2 is already at levels last seen around four million years ago, in the Pliocene epoch. It is rapidly heading towards levels last seen some 50 million years ago — in the Eocene — when temperatures were up to 14 °C higher than they were in pre-industrial times.”

Here’s more Doyle: “Since the last International Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report AR5 was published… All of this has come to light since then. We’ve realized that we have been living in a fool’s paradise, thinking that nice gentle reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and maybe changing to electric cars should see us over the bump. This is simply not the case.”

Doyle’s outlook darkens, as he declares the geo-engineering concept of sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere nowhere near ready for deployment and likely not possible because of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which essentially says: “You cannot build a machine to clean up the mess you made making the machine.”

Heaven forbid! People are depending upon geo-engineering to bail us out. What if it doesn’t?

Here’s more Doyle: “In the last 30 years we’ve been able to measure that the total amount of vertebrate life on this planet has collapsed by 99%. And, what’s left, at least from the tiny human being up to the big elephant are found loads of cows, loads of humans, and virtually no wild animals. It’s way worse than that. There are no wild animals. There are no fish. There are no insects. Your microbiome inside your own body is collapsing, at least 20% to 30% down over the last 20 to 30 years… We are not on the verge of the sixth mass extinction; we’re in the middle of it. And very likely to be part of it.”

Additionally, the Wet Bulb Temperature effect received mention: “This gives you the temperatures that living creatures can survive… on the left hand side you can see 42C (107.6F) degrees. Human beings can easily survive well over that. But there’s a catch… The fittest human being on the planet, if he is in a temperature of 36C degrees (96.8F) where there’s 100% relative humidity, he dies in six hours.”

“I (Doyle) was in a city (Brussels) in Europe in August. The temperature was 36C degrees and the relative humidity was 40. It only needed to be one and a half degrees higher and about 20% extra humidity for tens of thousands of people to be dying in the streets.”

Doyle provided additional evidence of the ongoing extinction event. Flying insect populations have crashed by 80% in Europe over the past 40 years. We don’t survive without insects… no questions asked!

But, there is one question: What causes 80% of flying insects to drop dead within a half-lifespan of an average human? Something is horribly wrong!

Solutions? Eliminating fossil fuels in enough time to stem excessive warming will not work for numerous reasons. Not only that, fossil fuels account for approximately 80% of all energy production, and there’s no way that’ll change soon enough to help within the next 10 years.

As an aside to Doyle’s terrifying speech, according to the IEA (International Energy Agency) fossil fuel producers, like the U.S., Russia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, plan on increasing oil and gas production by 120% by 2030, continuing to emit CO2 of ever-higher levels, bringing on more blanketed heat. China is embarking on mega-mega construction of new coal-burning power plants, and so is India, and Japan recently announced its intention to build 22 new coal-burning plants over the next 5 years, continuing to emit CO2 in ever-larger numbers, bringing on more blanketed heat. All of that in the face of irrefutable evidence of acceleration of climate change well beyond the influence of natural events. Maybe the world really is crazy after all.

According to Doyle: “The only option for “getting out of this mess is to stop pretending that we are going green.” To survive as a species, we must switch to local production and forget globalized growth. It’s over. The economic growth paradigm of neoliberal capitalism is incompatible with human survival, especially for life-supporting ecosystems.

It is worth noting that two respected French climate research organizations reached conclusions somewhat similar to Doyle’s but with much less gusto in their numbers. National Centre for Meteorological Research (CNRM) and Institute Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Modelling Centre in Paris contend, if CO2 emissions continue “business as usual,” then temperatures could increase by 7°C by 2100.

Still, it is incomprehensible, not impossible, that temperatures skyrocket 10C over the next 20-30 years. Is Doyle’s assessment realistic? What if it is?

Yet, Doyle’s thesis need not be 100% correct to disrupt and destroy ecosystems and cause panic amongst humankind. If he is 50% correct, large portions of the planet become uninhabitable. That’s just for starters.

And, if Doyle’s daunting analysis is only 25% correct, hard-charging 2C-plus circumstances will change life forever, less agricultural land, higher tidal flooding, and eco migrants by the hundreds of millions roaming countryside in massive waves of human flesh, searching for anything edible.

Indeed, it’s always instructive to look at other viewpoints, for example, the prestigious Met Office Hadley Centre/UK, assuming “business as usual” expects 4C by 2055. That’s more than enough to do the dirty work.

An International Panel on Climate Conference at Oxford University conducted a program entitled “4 Degrees and Beyond” that examined the likelihood of 4C, if “business as usual.” Their conclusion: Half of the planet turns uninhabitable.

All of which highlights a problem. “Business as usual” is thriving!

(… already looking past the speed bump COVID19)

According to Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, CO2 emissions for the month of April 2020 were 416.18 ppm versus 413.52 ppm for the month of April 2019. And, for added context, readings of 371.66 ppm were recorded for the month of April 2000.

“Business as usual” has not slowed down one iota in 62 years ever since Mauna Loa Observatory started collecting CO2 data in 1958. Noticeably, it has already accelerated+60% this century.

Maybe Doyle is onto something!"
"'Sorry, this is an emergency': Climate protesters block streets around world",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-protests/sorry-this-is-an-emergency-climate-protesters-block-streets-around-world-idUSKBN1WM1JP?il=0,"LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of climate-change protesters took to the streets in cities around the world on Monday, launching two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience to demand immediate action to cut carbon emissions and avert an ecological disaster.

In London, police arrested 276 activists from the Extinction Rebellion group as they blocked bridges and roads in the city center, and glued themselves to cars, while protesters in Berlin halted traffic at the Victory Column roundabout.

Dutch police stepped in to arrest more than 100 climate activists blocking a street in front of the country’s national museum and there were similar protests in Austria, Australia, France, Spain and New Zealand.

“SORRY that we blocked the road, but this is an emergency,” declared placards held by activists in Amsterdam.

In New York’s financial district, protesters spattered the Wall Street Bull and themselves with fake blood and lay prone around the sculpture to evoke their fears of a deadly environmental catastrophe.

The protests are the latest stage in an global campaign for tougher and swifter steps against climate change coordinated by Extinction Rebellion, which rose to prominence in April when it snarled traffic in central London for 11 days.

Last month, millions of young people flooded onto the streets of cities around the world, inspired to take action by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

Extinction Rebellion says it expects peaceful protests over the next two weeks in more than 60 cities from New Delhi to New York calling on governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 and halt a loss of biodiversity.

Banging drums and chanting, protesters in London took over Trafalgar Square and marched down the Mall, the avenue that leads to Buckingham Palace. They carried banners with slogans including “Climate change denies our children a future unless we act now”.

“We’re here because the government is not doing enough on the climate emergency,” protester Lizzy Mansfield said. “We only get one planet and so we’re here to try and defend it.”

Police chiefs said last week they would mobilize thousands of officers to handle the protests in London and that anyone who broke the law, even as part of non-violent civil disobedience, would be arrested.

On Saturday, officers used a battering ram to enter a building in south London where activists had been storing materials to use during the protests. Eight people were arrested during the raid.

“OUT OF TIME”

Defying almost freezing temperatures in Berlin, activists singing “Solid as a rock, rooted as a tree” gathered at dawn at the Victory Column roundabout near Tiergarten park.

At sunrise, some were sleeping in insulated bags in the middle of the roundabout as police on motorbikes drove by. No arrests were made and the protest remained peaceful.

Police blocked the five avenues that converge on the roundabout to stop cars and buses reaching the demonstration, as this would have resulted in traffic chaos during rush hour.

By midday, the protest had swelled to 4,000 people, a policeman said, and a second main roundabout was also blocked by activists sitting in the middle of the road.

Police began removing chanting protesters from Berlin’s Potsdamer Platz later in the day after they had occupied the central artery for much of the day, singing, making speeches and fashioning a makeshift camp out of salvaged armchairs and tents.

The rallies came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended climate protection measures her government is due to approve on Wednesday but which critics have condemned as unambitious.

In Amsterdam, police were lining up empty city buses to take the arrested demonstrators away as they tried to clear a major thoroughfare in the afternoon.

“The climate crisis is not being taken seriously enough by politics, and also not by the companies. That’s why I joined,” said one demonstrator, who gave his name as Christiaan.

Meanwhile activists in London, some wearing yellow safety helmets with “Rebel at Work” painted on the side, glued or chained themselves to cars parked in the middle of roads or to street lamps, making it hard for police officers to detain them.

“We are out of time, there is none left, we have to act now,” said a protester called Benjamin.

In central Paris, dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists blocked a street and bridge in the Chatelet district. They also built temporary shelters or held impromptu concerts and workshops in a good-natured atmosphere.

“This is clearly non-violent, it is human, we are not here with guns, we are here as human beings,” protester Francoise Loiseau said.

With events like extreme weather, thawing permafrost and a sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the climate crisis has intensified since the signing in 2015 of the Paris accord on curbing global warming.

Nearly 70 countries announced plans at a U.N. climate action summit last month to beef up their Paris pledges, but most major economies including the United States and China failed to announce stronger new measures."
"This wave of global protest is being led by the children of the financial crash From Hong Kong to South America to London, young people have had enough of economic, social and ecological collapse",https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/this-wave-of-global-protest-is-being-led-by-the-children-of-the-financial-crash-1.4065862,"“I’m 22 years old, and this is my last letter,” the young man begins. Most of his face is masked with black fabric; only his eyes, tired and steely, are visible below a messy fringe. “I’m worried that I will die and won’t see you any more,” he continues, his hands trembling. “But I can’t not take to the streets.”

The nameless demonstrator – one of many in Hong Kong who have been writing to their loved ones before heading out to confront rising police violence in the city – was filmed by the New York Times last week in an anonymous stairwell. But he could be almost anywhere, and not only because the walls behind him are white and characterless, left blank to protect his identity.

From east Asia to Latin America, northern Europe to the Middle East, there are young people gathering in stairwells, back alleys and basements whose faces display a similar blend of exhilaration and exhaustion. “The disaster of ‘chaos in Hong Kong’ has already hit the western world,” the former Chinese diplomat Wang Zhen declared in an official Communist party paper, following reports that protesters in Catalonia were being inspired by their counterparts in Hong Kong. “We can expect that other countries and cities may be struck by this deluge.”

Wang is right about the deluge. In the same week that those seeking independence from Spain occupied Barcelona airport and brought motorways to a standstill, Extinction Rebellion activists seized major bridges and squares across London, prompting nearly 2,000 arrests. Both mobilisations adopted tactics from Hong Kong, including fluid targets – inspired by Bruce Lee’s famous “be water“ mantra – and a repertoire of hand signals to outwit security forces.

Meanwhile Lebanon has been convulsed by its largest demonstrations in two decades, dozens have been killed during anti-government marches in Iraq, and in Egypt a blanket ban on dissent by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s brutal dictatorship failed to prevent sporadic anti-regime protests breaking out across the country late last month. In the Americas, where Wang once served as a Chinese government envoy, Ecuador, Chile and Haiti are all experiencing citizen uprisings that are virtually unprecedented in recent history, ushering vast numbers of people into the streets – as well as soldiers tasked with containing them.

Each of these upheavals has its own spark – a hike in transport fares in Santiago, or a proposed tax on users of messaging apps like WhatsApp in Beirut – and each involves different patterns of governance and resistance. The class composition of the indigenous demonstrators in Ecuador can’t be compared with most of those marching against the imprisonment of separatist leaders in Catalonia; nor is the state’s prohibition of protest in London on a par with the repression in Hong Kong, where officers shot live ammunition into a teenager’s chest.

And yet it’s clear that we are witnessing the biggest surge in global protest activity since the early 2010s, when a “movement of the squares” saw mass rallies in capital cities across the Arab world, followed by Occupy demonstrations in the global north. Historically speaking, the past decade has seen more protests than at any time since the 1960s. Despite their disparate grievances, some common threads do bind today’s rebellions together. Tracing them may help clarify the nature of our present political volatility.

One obvious link is also the most superficial: the role played by social media, which has been widely noted in the press. While it’s true that digital technologies have enabled more agile and horizontal forms of organising, the ubiquity of these tools in 2019 tells us almost nothing about what is driving people to take to the streets in the first place. Indeed, in many states, social media is now an instrument of state repression as much as it is a tool of revolt.

The most significant connection is generational. The majority of those protesting now are the children of the financial crisis – a generation that has come of age during the strange and febrile years after the collapse of a broken economic and political orthodoxy, and before its replacement has emerged.

One direct impact of the crash has been a rapid diminishment of opportunity for millions of young people in rich countries – who now regard precarious work and rising inequality as the norm. At the same time, the aftermath of the crash has cracked the entrenched structures that had evolved to detach citizens from active participation in politics – be that through authoritarian systems or via an institutional consensus on the inevitability of market logic and technocratic management. Amid widespread economic and social failure, it has become harder than ever for elites to justify power, even on their own terms.

All this has produced a generation charged with hopelessness and hope. Afflicted by what the anthropologist David Graeber calls “despair fatigue”, protesters are putting their bodies on the line because it feels as if they have no other choice – and because those who rule over them have rarely seemed more vulnerable. Most have spent their lives under the maxim “there is no alternative” – and now circumstances have forced them to widen their political imaginations in search of something new. As one poster proclaims in Chile: “It’s not about 30 pesos, it’s about 30 years.”

Facing them down are states determined to put citizens back in their box and reseal the borders of political participation. The problem for governments is that there is no longer an established centre ground to snap back to, and their opponents know it – which is why so many of those involved in the current mobilisations will not settle for token concessions from the authorities.

“We need a whole new system, from scratch,” declared one demonstrator in Lebanon. The crackdown on Catalan separatists by the Spanish government has brought back dark memories of the state’s dirty war in the Basque country in the 1980s and the Franco era that preceded it; troops are marching through city centres in Chile for the first time since Pinochet.

In China, Xi Jinping has claimed that any attempt to divide the nation will result in “bodies smashed and bones ground to powder”. In many places, grassroots victory – and radical political transformation – feels to many like the only possible resolution, lending clashes an “all or nothing” antagonism and urgency that is hard to roll back.

What has intensified this urgency is the backdrop of looming ecological catastrophe. Even where protests are not explicitly about environmental concerns, the prospect of planetary catastrophe in our lifetimes raises the stakes for all political action. “The kids who are walking out of school have a hugely radical understanding of the way that politics works, and they recognise that our democratic processes and structures as they stand are designed to uphold the status quo,” Jake Woodier, one of the organisers behind the UK climate strike movement, told me this year. “They know that they will be worse off than their parents, know that they’ll never own a home, and know that on current trends they could live to see the end of humanity. So for them, for us, politics is not a game, it’s reality, and that’s reflected in the way we organise – relentlessly, radically, as if our lives depend on it.”

The Cambridge political scientist Helen Thompson once argued: “The post-2008 world is, in some fundamental sense, a world waiting for its reckoning.” That reckoning is beginning to unfold globally. They may come from different backgrounds and fight for different causes, but the kids being handcuffed, building barricades, and fighting their way through teargas in 2019 all entered adulthood after the end of the end of history. They know that we are living through one of what the American historian Robert Darnton has called “moments of suspended disbelief”: those rare, fragile conjunctures in which anything seems conceivable, and – far from being immutable – the old rules are ready to be rewritten. As long as it feels like their lives depend on winning, the deluge will continue.

In the clear, calm, early hours of May 15, 2003, three miles west of the hulking ruins of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Vasyl Yoschenko was bustling around a stand of Scotch pines planted 30 years earlier. The trees were spindly and closely spaced, but he was skinny enough to move easily among them, taking samples of biomass and litter. Just beyond the trees, he tinkered with the horizontal plates he had placed on the ground in a diagonal grid and covered with superfine cloth designed to absorb whatever came their way. To hear more feature stories, get the Audm iPhone app. Yoschenko had just finished adjusting his monitoring equipment in the mid-afternoon when the first gusts of smoke billowed from the far side of the pines. Firefighters were torching the edges of an area the approximate size and shape of a football field. Wearing respirators, camouflage pants, and khaki shirts, cloth bandannas covering their heads, the men were systematically setting the woods ablaze. Flames leapt five feet up trunks, racing to the tops of some trees and sending plumes of smoke aloft.

Yoschenko, a Ukrainian radioecologist, had planned the controlled burn to study how radioactive particulates would behave in a fire, and he knew about the risks represented by the nuclear contamination swirling overhead. He prudently scooted to the edge of the forest, donned a gas mask, and began taking photographs. Was it dangerous? Yoschenko shrugs: “Not so much. We were lucky the wind didn’t change direction.” The forest burned intensely for 90 minutes, releasing cesium-137, strontium-90, and plutonium-238, -239, and -240 in blasts of smoke and heat. In just one hour, the firefighters—and Yoschenko—could have been exposed to more than triple the annual radiation limit for Chernobyl’s nuclear workers. “That was crazy,” says Sergiy Zibtsev, a forestry professor at the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. “That place was really contaminated. Yoschenko risked his life to provide new science—just like Marie Curie.” Read: Photos from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster Yoschenko’s scientific blaze was a preview of Chernobyl’s future. Since then, the area’s climate has warmed and dried, and its wildfires—most sparked by arson and other human activity—have grown larger and more frequent. Each fire releases radionuclides, just as Yoschenko and his colleagues documented in 2003; each one raises anxieties in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and in Europe’s major cities. But none has incinerated the landscape at the scale of the fires that burned this past April. They were far larger than any since the 1986 disaster, burning for weeks and scorching nearly 165,600 acres before rain finally doused them.

Monitors in Norway, 2,000 miles away, detected increased levels of cesium in the atmosphere. Kyiv was smothered in smoke. Press reports estimated that the level of radiation near the fires was 16 times higher than normal, but we may never know how much was actually released: Yoschenko, Zibtsev, and others impatient to take on-the-ground measurements were confined to their homes by the coronavirus pandemic. August is typically the worst month of the Chernobyl fire season, and this year, public anxiety is mounting. The devastation left by the world’s worst nuclear disaster is colliding with the disaster of climate change, and the consequences reach far and deep. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a rich mosaic of forests, grasslands, and bogs stretching 1,000 square miles across northern Ukraine. When I visited in 2013 I was shocked, like so many other visitors, by the abandoned family farmhouses with branches growing out of their empty windows, by painted silhouettes of children dancing on the walls of a community center in the hastily evacuated city of Pripyat, still haunted by their absence. But I also saw grasslands dotted with young pines, the wind wafting tawny heads of grains gone wild, and a white-tailed eagle soaring over the power plant cooling pond. In a grove of native birch trees, I stood in the morning light as it burnished the leaves against luminous white trunks. I was enchanted—until my dosimeter began chattering. Had I lingered there for an hour, I later realized, I would have been exposed to radiation levels 100 times beyond what’s considered safe for humans.

From Hiroshima, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, we are learning about the ghastly, lingering effects of radiation on human bodies. From the uninhabited landscapes of Chernobyl, we are learning how ecosystems react to—and recover from—the same invisible insult. Traveling the world to see microbes, plants, and animals in oceans, grasslands, forests, deserts, the icy poles—and wherever else they may be.

Read more In the chaos after the April 26, 1986, disaster, Soviet officials worked frantically to contain the radiation spewing from the nuclear power plant’s No. 4 reactor. To protect public health, they evacuated an area nearly the size of Yosemite National Park. Since then, only those with permission are allowed into this exclusion zone, which Ukrainians aptly call the Zone of Alienation. Ukrainian law mandates that nothing—no blackberries, no mushrooms, no radionuclides—leaves the zone until the radiation dissipates, a long-term proposition, given the 24,000-year half-life of plutonium-239. The unexpected result is an immense, long-term ecological laboratory. Within the exclusion zone, scientists are analyzing everything, including the health of the wolves and moose that have wandered back and the effects of radiation on barn swallows, voles, and the microorganisms that decompose forest litter. Now, as wildfires worsen, scientists are trying to determine how these hard-hit ecosystems will respond to yet another unparalleled disruption. Read: Visiting Chernobyl 32 years after the disaster Chernobyl is not a landscape inclined to burn. The Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant was built on the southwestern edge of the Pripyat Marshes, Europe’s largest swamp. For centuries, the watery terrain was all but impenetrable; floods made it impassable for months at a time, and bogs disoriented persistent invaders. The drier areas were forested with birch, aspen, other hardwoods, and some pines. Late in the 19th century, these forests were cleared for intensive agriculture. But even the most enterprising farmers struggled to grow wheat and other crops in the gravelly, sandy soil.

After Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union in 1922, the government returned the land to forests, logging them for fuel to produce glass and vodka. But instead of the natural mix of species, Soviet foresters planted row after evenly spaced row of Scotch pines, creating a giant softwood production area in a highly regulated forest. By the 1950s, these regularly logged pine plantations covered 400 square miles of what is now the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The explosions that wracked the nuclear power plant in 1986 transformed all life in the region, human and otherwise. Thirty-one people died as an immediate effect of the explosions, and as many as 150,000 have since died of radiation exposure in Ukraine alone. Conservative estimates predict that the death toll will grow by another 41,000; other estimates exceed 1 million. And the disaster upended the lives of those who survived: The mandatory evacuation of 350,000 people forced residents of Pripyat to leave their newly built city, farmers to abandon their fields, and loggers to find work elsewhere. The forest hit hardest by the nuclear blasts was a pine plantation that stood directly in the path of the most deadly debris. Pines are extremely sensitive to radiation, and the trees turned rust-orange before they died; workers nicknamed the plantation the “Red Forest.” As part of the effort to contain the radioactive material, they bulldozed it, buried the trees in more than 5 million square yards of topsoil, and covered the area with more than a foot of sand. Then they replanted it with pines. As the new trees grew, radiation in the soil suppressed an enzyme that contributes to the classic single-stem conifer shape, resulting in an expanse of odd-looking, bushy dwarf pines.

The rest of the forests in the exclusion zone were simply abandoned. Management stopped, leaving the heavily industrialized forests to evolve in their own way at their own pace. Pines began creeping into less contaminated farmland. Birches and other native species less sensitive to radiation began colonizing the hotter areas, slowly replacing the Scotch pines so favored by Soviet foresters. Before the explosion of Chernobyl’s nuclear reactor, forests covered about 30 percent of the exclusion zone; they now cover about 70 percent. Less than two months after the disaster, Soviet officials launched a research institution designed to study the effects of irradiation on agriculture and ecology. Renamed the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union, much of the information we have about contaminated foods and the dynamics of radionuclides has been developed here. When I arrived in 2012 at the institute, located in a suburb southwest of Kyiv, I was ushered through an imposing rotunda, where loose tiles in the beautifully ornate floor provided a percussive accompaniment as I clicked and clacked across it. Vasyl Yoschenko, then 47, was waiting in a conference room, pacing around a long table and fidgeting with his glasses. He has a thick shock of intensely white hair and a wandering left eye, which give him a slightly reckless look. In the spring of 1986, Yoschenko was a soldier in the Soviet Army, stationed 60 miles east of Moscow “for protection against the United States, of course,” he told me with an ironic grin. When his service ended a month after the disaster, he was excited to return to Kyiv: “It is a beautiful city, especially in spring, so just imagine what I was feeling after two years of military service.” Instead, he found an empty city. The only people on the streets were those employed to wash them down. Yoschenko resumed his education, completing a master’s degree in 1989 and immediately going to work at the radiology institute. Now armed with a doctorate, he carried at the time the unwieldy title of head of the laboratory of radioecological monitoring, mathematical modeling and dosimetry. He simplified it for me: “I study radiation.”

Read: California’s wildfires are 500 percent larger due to climate change One of the institute’s most important early tasks was to estimate the concentrations of radionuclides in the soil throughout the exclusion zone. In the conference room, Yoschenko pointed to two framed documents covered with polygons of colors ranging from pale green to screaming orange. Made in 1997 and 2000, these are the first maps to chart the deposits of strontium, plutonium, and other radionuclides that rained down during the disaster. With Yoschenko and others, the institute head Valery Kashparov found that two-thirds of some of the contaminants and almost all the plutonium and strontium have been retained in Ukrainian soil. That was a surprise to some scientists, who had assumed that the radionuclides would move quickly into the water table or scatter around the world in the volatile winds generated by the explosions. Instead, as much as 96 percent of radionuclide activity was confined to the top 10 centimeters of soil. Over the past 30 years, the government has largely succeeded at keeping what’s in Chernobyl in Chernobyl. But the radionuclides aren’t contained by Ukraine’s quixotic law forbidding their movement. They’re contained by functioning ecosystems. The gases and debris blasted out of the nuclear power plant fell on trees, grasses, other plants, and fungi, coating them with radionuclides; as much as 90 percent of the contamination was captured in the canopies of pines and other conifers. When their needles fell to the ground, they became part of the forest litter, slowly dispersing the radionuclides they carried into the top layer of soil. Within several years, the trees began taking up these radioactive elements; because cesium and strontium are the chemical analogues of potassium and calcium, Yoschenko and his colleagues studied how the unsuspecting trees treated them as nutrients, absorbing them into their roots and moving them into their trunks. Over time, cesium and strontium accumulate in the trees’ needles, which again fall to the ground and become part of the forest litter.

Without trees or other permanent ground cover, Chernobyl’s radionuclides would have been carried out of the zone by wind or water. By sucking up the nuclear leftovers strewn across the landscape, the forests are stabilizing the contamination, helping prevent the spread of radionuclides south to Kyiv and northwest to Europe. The forests’ astonishing ability to both survive and contain radiation is now threatened by the worsening wildfires, exacerbated by climate change. “Forests are our friend in health, our enemy when they burn,” says Zibtsev, the forestry professor. When Chernobyl’s trees burn, they send their stored radionuclides aloft as inhalable aerosols. Instead of blasting from a single source, as it did in 1986, the contamination now comes from the trees that cover some 660 square miles around the nuclear power plant. Twenty-five years after the disaster, Zibtsev and others predicted that if the forests in the exclusion zone were completely consumed by fire, residents in Kyiv would face an increased risk of dying from cancer and government bans would need to be imposed on foods produced as far as 90 miles away. Although such a large and intense fire is currently unlikely, recent fires have been sizable enough to create similar problems. “If Chernobyl forests burn, contaminants will migrate outside the immediate area,” says Zibtsev. “We know that.” Zibtsev, 59, is lean and lanky, with a heavy gray crew cut that always seems fully grown out. His father, a teacher, spent the summer of 1986 working outdoors, mostly in Kyiv. He developed cataracts that he suspected were caused by his radiation exposure, though they were never officially attributed to it. Two years later Zibtsev, whose doctorate in forest ecology is from Dnipro State University, had an opportunity to do research in the irradiated forests. His parents, afraid for his safety, refused to allow it. “They didn’t think I needed to risk my health over researching the migration of radionuclides in temporary waste-storage sites,” he told me.

His career stopped. “You don’t turn down a good opportunity like this, but I did,” he said. Instead, he mapped contamination in forests 150 miles west of the No. 4 reactor, where, ironically, the random patterns of radiation release deposited radionuclides that exposed him to the danger he was trying to avoid. Another offer to monitor Chernobyl forests came in 1993, and this time Zibtsev took it. He spent the next five summers collecting soil and vegetation samples that were later analyzed for traces of radionuclides. The radiation he found there was higher than it had been in the period immediately following the explosions, a surprising observation until Yoschenko’s 2003 experimental burn explained it: Fires had burned 12,500 acres in 1992, ripping through the crowns of trees and depositing hot ashes across the exclusion zone in the first out-of-control blaze since the disaster. Read: The forest service is about to set a giant forest fire—on purpose Zibtsev was on a Fulbright scholarship to Yale University in 2005 when he learned about catastrophic wildland fires in the western United States. “What if that happened here?” he wondered. “More than Ukraine would be affected.” Zibtsev started drumming up international interest in fire and radioactive safety. Not only Chernobyl firefighters but “distant populations” in other countries were at risk, he told an international conference in 2007. He began coordinating projects aimed at improving wildfire-management capacities through the Regional Eastern Europe Fire Monitoring Center, which he established in 2013 under the umbrella of the Global Fire Monitoring Center and the Council of Europe.

In 2015, a rash of fires in Chernobyl brought international attention to their dangers. By that time, the abandoned forests had filled with flammable dead trees, and when farmers just outside the zone set their fields ablaze—a time-honored agricultural practice—the nearby stands quickly caught fire. From April to August, 37,066 acres burned within the exclusion zone. Zibtsev and his colleagues later reported that radiation releases in the zone during the fires were nearly 10 times normal levels, and that radiation levels in the forests of Chernobyl and Belarus nearly doubled in 2015. Alarmed by the potential for fire-borne radiation releases over Europe, international concern focused on the sorry state of the firefighting forces assembled in Chernobyl. In the exclusion zone, firefighters monitor smoke from rickety lookout towers built before the 1986 disaster. Access roads are deteriorating and often blocked by downed trees. Though Zibtsev helped design a system of fuel breaks creating gaps in the vegetation, the large majority have never been built. The situation is worsened by an almost complete lack of coordination among the three agencies with jurisdiction in the exclusion zone. Faced with government instability, economic chaos, and a six-year war with Russia, Zibtsev said, Ukrainian officials do not have the energy, financial resources, or political will to concentrate on fires in Chernobyl.

During my 2012 visit, the firefighter Nikolay Ossienko showed me around the Paryshev Fire Station near the Belarus border, one of seven stations in the exclusion zone. A fleet of well-polished but aging four-by-four fire trucks was parked in a shed next to the wooden building that serves as the station’s office. Dominating the compound was an imposing Soviet-built tank, modified with a pointed plow blade. It’s used to create fuel breaks by crushing trees and brush—“anything,” explained Ossienko, a burly, blue-eyed Ukrainian whose warm smile winked with a missing tooth. Though firefighters like Ossienko maintain their equipment admirably, says Zibtsev, most of their vehicles are at least 20 years old and no longer reliable. During the April fires, many of them broke down, forcing firefighters to evacuate. In recent years, a U.S. Forest Service project has installed five fire-detection cameras within the exclusion zone, provided protective gear and breathing devices to Chernobyl firefighters, and developed a fire-management plan to coordinate fire-suppression efforts. It’s very helpful, Zibtsev said, but it hasn’t solved the equipment shortage. In April, camera traps, which the University of South Carolina professor Timothy Mousseau had set up to monitor wildlife, photographed men fighting fire with wet rags. “No shirts, no masks, no gloves, just wandering around in a burning fire trying to tamp it out,” he told me.

This April’s fires, which scorched 23 percent of the exclusion zone, were the largest burns ever recorded in the area, nearly four and a half times the size of fires in 2015. Flames torched trees less than three miles from the ruined nuclear reactor, which is now enclosed by an arch-shaped steel shroud. Although the fires expose Chernobyl’s firefighters to dangerous levels of radiation, their risks to residents of the region and beyond are so far relatively low. But as Zibtsev pointed out, individual health is a combination of many factors—food, water, quality of life—and any increase in radiation exposure, however small, adds to existing stresses. In his office, as he ticked off various threats to human health, he moved a small box around on the desktop in front of him, closer and closer to the edge. When he got to radiation, it tottered, ready to fall onto his lap. “Too many stressors hasten death,” he said. Fire also imposes one more stress on Chernobyl’s ecosystems, a decidedly human wrench thrown into their long recovery from nuclear disaster. Induced by climate change and sparked by human activity, fire here is only slightly more natural than radiation. Persistent and widespread fire may destroy soil organics and radically redistribute the accumulated radionuclides, Yoschenko said, altering soil chemistry. Changes in soil chemistry will alter plants, which in turn will affect the food chain and animals dependent on it. And larger, more intense fires could destroy the forests entirely, obliterating their ability to keep what’s in Chernobyl in Chernobyl. “Keeping forests healthy is the main ingredient to preventing the migration of radionuclides outside the zone,” Zibtsev told me. For now, Chernobyl’s forests and grasslands are continuing to process cesium, strontium, and other radionuclides. Even the roots of the contorted trees in the Red Forest are taking up radionuclides, holding and stabilizing them in an ecosystem’s gift to the humans who created these contaminants. That process promises to continue—at least until the August fire season gets underway."

Some parts of modern life are, at this point, widely known to cause environmental harm — flying overseas, using disposable plastic items, and even driving to and from work, for example. But when it comes to our clothes, the impacts are less obvious.

As consumers worldwide buy more clothes, the growing market for cheap items and new styles is taking a toll on the environment. On average, people bought 60% more garments in 2014 than they did in 2000. Fashion production makes up 10% of humanity’s carbon emissions, dries up water sources, and pollutes rivers and streams.

What’s more, 85% of all textiles go to the dump each year. And washing some types of clothes sends thousands of bits of plastic into the ocean.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing[1] for the April - June 2020 and July - September 2020 quarters:

During the April – June 2020 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $2,999 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $800 billion. The borrowing estimate is $3,055 billion higher than announced in February 2020. The increase in privately-held net marketable borrowing is primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including expenditures from new legislation to assist individuals and businesses, changes to tax receipts including the deferral of individual and business taxes from April – June until July, and an increase in the assumed end-of-June Treasury cash balance.[2]

During the July – September 2020 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $677 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $800 billion.

During the January – March 2020 quarter, Treasury borrowed $477 billion in privately-held net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $515 billion. In February 2020, Treasury estimated privately-held net marketable borrowing of $367 billion and assumed an end-of-March cash balance of $400 billion. The $110 billion increase in borrowing resulted primarily from the higher end-of-quarter cash balance.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 6, 2020.

Show Caption Hide Caption 13 charged in plots against Mich. governor, police Six people have been charged in federal court with plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at her vacation home. Separately, seven more people have been charged with trying to target police and the Michigan Capitol.

The Wolverine Watchmen militia group didn't just plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, but they were on a mission to attack the state Capitol and target police officers at their homes as part of a broader mission to instigate a civil war, authorities said Thursday in announcing felony charges against 13 militia members accused in a sensational case of domestic terrorism.

Attorney General Dana Nessel referred to the accused as ""extremists"" who are hoping to recruit new members ""by seizing on a moment of civil unrest"" to wreak havoc on the country. She identified the militia group as the Wolverine Watchmen, whose members are accused of, among other things, conducting surveillance outside Whitmer's vacation residence, using code language and encrypted messages to throw off police and planting a bomb under a bridge to divert law enforcement.

“There has been a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies,” Nessel said at a press conference Thursday. ""This is more than just political disagreement or passionate advocacy, some of these groups’ mission is simply to create chaos and inflict harm upon others.”

Nessel's comments follow the filing of an FBI affidavit in U.S. District Court that alleges six militia members plotted a revolt on the government that included kidnapping Whitmer.

According to the FBI affidavit, the accused purchased items including a Taser and night goggles, conducted surveillance at Whitmer's cottage, and discussed blowing up a bridge to divert police, kidnapping Whitmer, and taking her to Wisconsin to face a ""trial"" for treason.

The federal case is being prosecuted out of the Western District of Michigan. Charged in that case are: Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta, according to a criminal complaint. They are charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, according to the complaint.

All are residents of Michigan except Croft, who is a resident of Delaware, the complaint alleges.

While federal charges are pending against those suspects, Nessel announced a fresh batch of charges against seven additional defendants, including providing material support for terrorists acts —- a 20 year felony, and felony firearm. The suspects are:

Paul Bellar, 21, of Milford

Shawn Fix, 38, of Belleville

William Null, 38, of Shelbyville

Pete Musico, 42, and Joseph Morrison, 42, both of Munith

Eric Molitor, 36, of Cadillac

Michael Null, 38, of Plainwell

Nessel said the suspects called on other members to identify the home addresses of law enforcement officers in order to target them, ""made threats of violence to instigate a civil war leading to societal collapse"" and engaged in the planning and training for an operation to attack the state Capitol building and kidnap government officials, including Whitmer.

Gov. Whitmer denounces hate groups Detroit Free Press reporter Paul Egan interviews Gov. Gretchen Whitmer after she decried hatred and bigotry from her Capitol office Thursday in response to an alleged plot by domestic terrorists to kidnap her.

According to federal court records, the group hoped to carry out this mission before the Nov. 3 election and try Whitmer for treason.

The plot, however, foiled following a federal investigation that involved paid undercover informants and 200 state and federal law enforcement officials executing search warrants in more than a dozen cities around the state, including, Belleville, Cadillac, Canton, Charlotte, Clarkston, Grand Rapids, Luther, Munith, Orion Township, Ovid, Portage, Shelby Township and Waterford.

Col. Joe Gasper, director of the Michigan State Police, which is involved in the case, said ""the nature of this case is rather unprecedented.""

""This case is one of the largest cases in recent history that the Michigan State Police been involved in, "" Gasper said. ""It sends a very vivid reminder that while we may be in period of discourse ... (with) fighting across the nation, law enforcement stands united.""

Added U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider for the Eastern District of Michigan:

""All of us can disagree about politics, but those disagreements should never, ever result in violence. The allegations in this complaint are deeply disturbing.""

The alleged plot against the governor marks the second major militia case brought by federal officials in Michigan in the last decade.

The last one was a major embarrassment for the federal government as it ended with the vindication of all the defendants, some who were jailed for years. The case involved the 2009 arrests of seven Hutaree militia members who were charged with plotting a revolt against the government that included killing police officers with guns and bombs.

All faced up to life in prison, but their trial ended abruptly in 2012 when U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts concluded that the government failed to prove its case. In the end, the judge concluded, there was not proof of a real plot to overthrow the government or kill police, but people engaging in tough talk, she said

Japan auto companies triple Mexican pay rather than move to US,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Japan-auto-companies-triple-Mexican-pay-rather-than-move-to-US,"NEW YORK/TOKYO -- The new North American free trade agreement that goes into effect Wednesday was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as an engine of American job creation. But Japan's automakers are largely opting instead to keep operations in place and pay Mexican workers more or even just pay tariffs.

The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement requires 40% or more of parts for each passenger vehicle be manufactured by workers who are paid at least $16 per hour as a condition to make them tariff free in the region. Trump hailed that feature as a way to boost production in the U.S., which has a higher hourly rate than Mexico.

However, this looks to be wishful thinking. The ratio of US-Canada parts among Mexican-assembled vehicles sold in the U.S. was 13.5% in 2018, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trump's theory was that U.S. production would inevitably increase to meet the 40% requirement, but Japanese automakers, which had already positioned their production bases according to the old NAFTA regime, are not simply willing to pull up stakes and redeploy.

One reason is the cost of moving production. Honda Motor-affiliated parts maker Keihin will raise the hourly wage of employees at a factory in Mexico to $16 by next month -- triple the average rate of a parts factory in Mexico, but still cheaper than making a move. Because the pandemic has hurt earnings, the cost of the moving production will likely be too burdensome over the foreseeable future.

Auto component maker Piolax, will also raise the hourly wage at its Mexican plant to $16 within the year. The company is also installing robots to mitigate rising labor costs, President Yukihiko Shimazu said.

Toyota Motor, which built a new plant in Mexico in 2015, is not finding it easy to change plans either. The new plant started full-scale production of pickup trucks in February. The trucks are popular in the U.S. and would be subject to a 25% tariff if they do not meet the content requirements of the USMCA. But if Toyota does not operate the factory, it cannot recover its investment.

""We don't want to be whipped around by a policy that we don't know how long it will last,"" said an executive at a Japanese automaker.

Toyota has told the U.S. government that it will invest $13 billion in America over a five-year period beginning in 2017, but most of this commitment was made before Trump became president.

Consumers will ultimately pay the price for inefficient production and increased component flow. U.S. research agency Center for Automotive Research estimates that 13% to 24% of all cars sold in the U.S. will be subject to tariffs. If automakers pass these costs on, prices will rise by $470 to $2,200.

The center also said U.S. car sales will drop by up to 1.3 million units annually due to the Trump administration's trade policy -- including sanctions on China. It estimates that 70,000 to 360,000 jobs will be lost, leading to a $6 billion to $30.4 billion reduction in gross domestic product.

The pandemic is also dragging down demand, setting up a tough road ahead for the auto industry."
"""In 1987, 81% of our world’s energy consumption came from oil, natural gas and coal. Thirty years later, it is still 81%""",https://www.axios.com/why-climate-change-is-so-hard-to-tackle-our-stubborn-energy-system-6c8fc596-3c47-477a-82aa-cd00f063c9a0.html,"To adequately address climate change on the level scientists say we must, the world would need to slash its use of oil, natural gas and coal within 30 years, a Herculean task given our deep dependence.

Driving the news: Democrats on the presidential campaign trail and international leaders preparing for a United Nations summit next month say urgent action is needed, but few actually have viable plans for how and when to cut our fossil-fuel use.

This column and last week's edition explore what makes this such a uniquely difficult problem.

The big picture: In 1987, 81% of our world’s energy consumption came from oil, natural gas and coal. Thirty years later, it is still 81% — despite the incredible increase in wind and solar energy, according to the International Energy Agency.

Fossil fuels’ staying power

Global fossil-fuel companies have built powerful political operations to lobby governments to maintain subsidies and oppose big climate policy.

This is starting to change among some oil companies, but it’s an uneven shift, and it's not (yet) fundamentally changing the system they helped build.

But a lot more is driving fossil fuels’ dominance than just corporate influence on government. Oil, natural gas and coal provide immense benefits to society — even though they also have immense environmental costs.

The chemical makeup of the fuels make them especially good at a lot of things, including industrial processes like making plastics. Renewables or other resources cannot easily replace that (even though big brands, like Legos, are trying).

""Some sectors, such as transportation and petrochemicals [plastics], almost completely rely on one single fuel, in this case oil,” said Fatih Birol, IEA executive director. Nonetheless, Birol said fossil-fuel consumption subsidies that totaled $400 billion in 2018 are providing an “unfair advantage” to those fuels.

Our dependence on fossil fuels is often likened to that of cigarette smoking, but the analogy doesn’t hold up.

Smoking is an unhealthy habit some people choose to engage in, and if they choose, they can try to kick that addiction without changing their life.

Fossil fuels are the foundation of our global economy, and it’s nearly impossible to go about our lives without using them in some form.

More addition, less transition

In the world of energy and climate change, people talk about the “energy transition,” the concept that we are moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy. But for now and the next few decades, it’s more of an energy addition.

Renewable electricity (which is the primary use for wind and solar) is often being added on top of instead of in lieu of fossil fuels, particularly in Asia’s rapidly growing economies.

Our energy system, particularly electricity, is built on multi-billion dollar infrastructure investments designed to last decades. Replacing them is like changing direction on a jetliner, not a jet ski.

Because of this dynamic and because our global energy demand keeps rising, our emissions keep growing despite the skyrocketing use of wind and solar energy.

Flashback: History shows that energy transitions take many decades and overlap, as Reuters analyst John Kemp wrote in a must-read column late last year.

“The United States was still using more fuel wood in the 1910s than it had in the 1840s — even though wood had been clearly overtaken by coal and to a lesser extent petroleum as an energy source.”

Consumer demand vs. expectation

More people around the world say they’re worried about climate change — but that concern is not translating into a willingness to pay more for energy or vote for candidates who support aggressive action.

We saw that happen in this spring’s Australian national elections, French protests over gasoline taxes and a Washington state carbon tax ballot initiative failure in 2018, as I detailed in this story from May.

One notable exception: Europe’s parliamentary elections this spring saw elections of pro-environmental candidates.

A common theme in these examples is how passively we consume energy. That sets this sector apart from others and makes change more elusive because the connection with consumers is less acute.

Unlike, say, Apple and Coca Cola, most energy companies are selling products we engage with passively. We expect the pumps at the gas station to pump gasoline and the lights to come on when we flip the switch, but we don’t actually think about it (unless the lights don’t come on or if there’s no gas pumping).

and the lights to come on when we flip the switch, but we don’t actually think about it (unless the lights don’t come on or if there’s no gas pumping). On the other hand, we think a lot about how we engage with our phones and whether to drink a Diet Coke or sparkling water.

What’s (maybe) next: If a Democrat wins the White House in 2020, America will likely be a political and technical test case for policies drastically and swiftly reducing our deep fossil-fuel dependence. That's because most of the Democratic candidates are calling for such a move, with Sen. Bernie Sanders proposing the most aggressive plan just last week.

"As we enter the 2020’s, high unemployment and looming massive homelessness on the horizon, something that was predicted in Star Trek 25 years ago is sounding eerily prescient",https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bell_Riots,"""...there is one thing I don't understand: how could they have let things get so bad?""

""That's a good question. I wish I had an answer.""

The Bell Riots were a pivotal series of events on Earth that took place in September of 2024. Started in San Francisco's Sanctuary District A, they were named after protest leader Gabriel Bell. One of the most violent civil disturbances in all of American history, the riots and subsequent crackdown resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Sanctuary District residents. (DS9: ""Past Tense, Part I"", ""Past Tense, Part II"")

Prelude

By the 2020s, the American government – reacting to serious problems of homelessness and unemployment – created special Sanctuary Districts (essentially walled-off sections of the city grid) in most major cities. Unfortunately – while established with the benevolent intent of providing free housing and food, as well as prospects for future employment – the Sanctuaries quickly degenerated into inhumane internment camps for the poor. Even though people with criminal records were not allowed inside Sanctuaries, it didn't take long for the homeless and unemployed to be joined by the mentally ill and other, more violent, social outcasts. These groups were referred to by their slang terms – gimmies, dims, and ghosts.

By late 2024, the twenty square blocks that made up Sanctuary District A had become overcrowded slums. With the records of people inside the Sanctuaries not uploaded to the planetary computer network (and therefore not accessible using an Interface), the true conditions inside were unknown to the general public. American society believed that, despite the political upheaval affecting Europe at the time, the United States was stable and had found a way to successfully deal with the social problems that had been the genesis of the Sanctuaries. An ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality had set in. People in the district started to believe that their needs were forgotten.

The spark

On August 30th, three Starfleet officers, Benjamin Sisko, Julian Bashir, and Jadzia Dax, arrived in San Francisco from 2371, due to a transporter accident. Knocked unconscious during the transport, Sisko and Bashir were awoken by security guards Vin and Bernardo Calvera, who mistakenly believed that the pair of newcomers were homeless. Sisko and Bashir lacked any form of identification and their combadges had been stolen so they were brought to Sanctuary District A, where they were processed by health official Lee. Inside, Sisko and Bashir, in accordance with Starfleet's temporal displacement policy, tried not to affect history while looking for a way out to find Dax.

Dax had meanwhile been awoken and befriended by Chris Brynner, who thought she had been mugged and who found her a place to stay.

On the night of the 31st, Bashir was assaulted by a gang of ghosts trying to take his ration card. In the ensuing scuffle, a man stepped in to help him but was stabbed to death by Biddle Coleridge (B.C.), who hurriedly vacated the scene. Sisko checked the victim's ration card and thereby discovered that the man who had died helping them was Gabriel Bell. Realizing they had changed the past, Sisko (assuming Bell's identity) and Bashir joined gimmie Michael Webb – whom they had met earlier – in gathering support for a rally outside the Sanctuary Processing Center, the next day.

Riot

Early in the morning of September 1st, a fight between a guard and a dim sparked a riot, wherein the ghosts led by B.C. attacked the Sanctuary guards and quickly captured the Sanctuary Processing Center as well as the rest of the district. Armed with the weapons of the overpowered guards, the ghosts took six center employees hostage, including Vin, Calvera, and Lee. They were joined by ""Gabriel Bell"" and Michael Webb, who acted as the voice and face of the riot while dealing with police negotiator Detective Preston.

Chris Brynner, who owned Brynner Information Systems (which operated Channel 90 on the net), was convinced by Dax to break the law and to reconnect the Processing Center after the police cut it off. Reconnected on September 2nd, many Sanctuary residents (such as Henry Garcia) were able to tell their stories of imprisonment to the outside world. As a result, the American public became aware of the great injustice that had been hidden from them and further riots broke out in Sanctuaries across the US.

Despite protests from Detective Preston, the governor of California ordered National Guardsmen to retake the Sanctuary by force on September 3rd at 0500 hours. In the melee, hundreds of Sanctuary residents were killed, including B.C. and Michael Webb. ""Gabriel Bell"" was shot, protecting Vin and the other hostages (all of whom remained unharmed).



Aftermath

Vin and Bernardo took Bell's and Bashir's ration cards after the riot, saying they would list them as casualties, and helped them return to their beam-in site, where Dax was waiting for them. Both Vin and Bernardo went on to tell other people what had happened in the Sanctuary, never knowing that Sisko had been Bell. The away team was rescued by Major Kira Nerys and Chief Miles O'Brien shortly thereafter.

In the wake of the riots, and the senseless death of so many people, public opinion turned against the concept of the Sanctuary Districts. The Districts were abolished as the United States finally began to face the serious social problems it had struggled with for over a century. Because Bell had played a crucial role in protecting the hostages, and in the negotiations prior to the government assault, he was remembered as one of the central figures in the events and his name became forever associated with them.

The Bell Riots were of such significance that their absence from Earth's history led to an alternate timeline, in which the United Federation of Planets was never created.

Appendices

Background information

The conceptualization of the Bell Riots began after Robert Hewitt Wolfe suggested doing a DS9 episode about homelessness. Even though he and Ira Steven Behr tried several ways of doing the story, they were particular about what form the protest against homelessness would take. René Echevarria recalled, ""We certainly didn't want to do a Martin Luther King, which would have been an obvious way to go. We didn't want to have Sisko leading a march or a protest."" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, p. 89)

Ultimately, the writers based the Bell Riots on two historical incidents, both of which took place in the early 1970s: the Kent State shootings of anti-war protesters in 1970 and the Attica Prison riot in 1971. Whereas the reactions to the former event had had a major impact on Ira Steven Behr, his idea of basing the protest on the Attica Prison riot was also a major influence on the DS9 story itself. Behr stated, ""I was driving home one evening, and I suddenly thought, 'Attica.' I came in the next day and told Robert, 'I hope you like it, because I think this is the way we have to do it – we're gonna do concentration camps."" (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, p. 196) Of the Kent State shootings, Behr remembered, ""Once they started shooting down American college students, everyone I knew who was still pro-war said, 'Maybe we should just end this damn thing.' And many of the counterculture kids, ironically, said, 'If they're gonna shoot us, screw the revolution. Let's become accountants.' It had a big impact on me, and I got the idea of doing a combination of Kent State and an Attica [prison]-type siege, starting with the question: What would happen if the government started putting these people in camps? How would society deal with that or rationalize it? How would the homeless people deal with it?"" (Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages, pp. 89-90)

The Watts Riots of 1965 were also an inspiration. Jean-Luc Picard and Geordi La Forge traveled back in time to twentieth-century Los Angeles just before the Watts Riots in Wolfe's original story pitch. (Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, p. 282)

Scientists Warn Multiple Overlapping Crises Could Trigger 'Global Systemic Collapse',https://www.sciencealert.com/hundreds-of-top-scientists-warn-combined-environmental-crises-will-cause-global-collapse/,"Overlapping environmental crises could tip the planet into ""global systemic collapse,"" more than 200 top scientists warned Wednesday.

Climate change, extreme weather events from hurricanes to heatwaves, the decline of life-sustaining ecosystems, food security and dwindling stores of fresh water – each poses a monumental challenge to humanity in the 21st century.

Out of 30 global-scale risks, these five topped the list both in terms of likelihood and impact, according to scientists surveyed by Future Earth, an international research organisation.

In combination, they ""have the potential to impact and amplify one another in ways that might cascade to create global systemic collapse,"" a team led by Maria Ivanova, a professor at the Center for Governance and Sustainability at the University of Massachusetts, said in a 50-page report.

Extreme heat waves, for example, speed global warming by releasing planet-warming gases from natural sources, even as they intensify water crises and food scarcity.

Biodiversity loss, meanwhile, weakens the capacity of natural and agricultural systems to cope with climate extremes, also putting food supplies at risk.

Scientists worry especially that rising temperatures could tip the planet's climate system into a self-perpetuating spiral of global warming.

As it is, humanity is struggling – so far unsuccessfully – to cap CO2 and methane emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels.

If at the same time a warming Earth also begins to emit large amounts of these gases from, say, thawing permafrost, such efforts could be overwhelmed.

""Many scientists and policymakers are embedded in institutions that are used to thinking and acting on isolated risks, one at a time,"" the report said.

""We call on the world's academics, business leaders and policy makers to pay attention to these five global risks and ensure they are treated as interacting systems.""

Nearly 1,000 decision makers and top CEOs highlighted the same threats in a similar survey last month ahead of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

""2020 is a critical time to look at these issues,"" said Amy Luers, Executive Director of Future Earth.

""Our actions in the next decade will determine our collective future.""

Far West free-for-all

In October, the world's nations are set to gather for a major United Nations meeting in Kunming, China to try to stanch the destruction of ecosystems and the decline of biodiversity.

Scientists agree that Earth is at the outset of a mass extinction event – only the 6th in half-a-billion years – which could drive a million species, or one-in-eight, into oblivion over the coming decades or centuries.

The following month, a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow will reveal whether the world's major economies are willing to ramp up carbon cutting pledges that fall far short of what is needed to keep the planet hospitable for our species.

2020 is also a critical year in ongoing negotiations over the high seas, where a Far West free-for-all has led to overfishing and unrestrained resource extraction.

Some scientists have begun to look at the likelihood and impacts of cascading environmental crises.

Recent research has shown, for example, that some parts of the world may soon be coping with up to six extreme weather events at once, ranging from heat waves and wildfires to diluvian rains and deadly storm surges.

""Human society will be faced with the devastating combined impacts of multiple interacting climate hazards,"" Erik Franklin, a researcher at the University of Hawaii's Institute of Marine Biology and co-author of a key study in late 2018, told AFP.

""They are happening now and will continue to get worse.""

That is true even in optimistic emissions reduction scenarios.

If, for example, humanity caps global warming at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, New York City will likely face one major climate hazard every year, on average, by 2100.

The 2015 Paris climate treaty calls for holding the rise in temperature to ""well below"" 2C.

If, however, carbon pollution continues unabated, the Big Apple could be hit by up to four such calamities at once, including extreme rain, sea level rise and storm surges.

In all such scenarios, tropical coastal areas suffer the most.

"People are aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but choose to ignore it. It is an unspoken collective turning away. Anthropologist Kari Norgaard labelled this phenomenon ""socially organised denial""",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/i-dont-want-to-be-seen-as-a-zealot-what-mps-really-think-about-the-climate-crisis,"One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it’s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament.

The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution.

She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone – maybe a constituent or the local paper – would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. “I thought I might get a bit of pushback,” she told me. “I’ve had absolutely zero.”

This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to strengthen these targets, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition – in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we’re all in favour of climate action, but we haven’t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions.

I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we’re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It’s easier to look away.

In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything will be different. If, as I’ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away?

Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts – and a political strategy that will allow this to happen – has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed.

I’ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair’s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law.

Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. “I don’t remember it being one of the big issues,” she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, “I remember it going on in the background, but it wasn’t something that had high temperature”. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change – and then carried on as normal.

That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn’t understand what it was all about?

With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs’ questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians – ministers or frontbenchers – to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party.

Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a “penny-drop moment”, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more – and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don’t act.

And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives.

We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own renewable energy projects. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren’t they doing more?

I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs – 23 in all – to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, number of known “climate sceptic” MPs, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.

I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence.

All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate “terrified” him. “Where we’re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn’t fancy our chances.”

I asked why, if it’s so significant, it wasn’t discussed much in parliament. But he didn’t answer. He couldn’t, or didn’t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him.

Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn’t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn’t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate.

It’s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: “You might not get into double figures.” She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as tax breaks for oil and gas exploration. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: “I think they’d just think you were a bit ‘niche’, is the way I’d put it – I say ‘niche’ in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.”

One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: “I was known as being a freak.” Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a “zealot”. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. “I don’t use climate change as the word because I think it’s just toxic,” he told me. “As is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won’t take people with you politically.”

This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine – and politicians are no exception.

Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn’t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, having to resort to artificial snow – something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives.

Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: “How could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible – simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?” She labelled this phenomenon “socially organised denial”. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn’t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and “with nature”. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged.

Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels.

As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry “cannot be shut down overnight”. She’s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere – not overnight, but urgently.

The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I’ve come to think of as the “feelgood fallacy”. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won’t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas – yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this.

If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it’s burned, not where it’s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions.

Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, “I’ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters … and I just don’t have conversations about climate change.”

Many of these conversations took place before the school climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests began in 2018 – these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK’s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as “almost like being a parent. It’s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.”

Exactly how a politician “represents” the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying”: “I am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.” This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate – a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end – it’s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate.

They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: “I’m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.” Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, “there would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: ‘Oh, here he goes again.’” Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option.

There’s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don’t speak out, people don’t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don’t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move.

But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like?

In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional environmental benefits of lockdown. It’s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is in no way a model for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls.

What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why.

Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite – handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy.

If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a Green New Deal. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward a plan aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare.

Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour’s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate.

A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens’ assemblies. Early this year, Climate Assembly UK got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament.

Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there’s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats – not least, those arising from climate change.

Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can’t govern in a vacuum. We can’t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician’s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn’t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful.

Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around.

Seafood Study Finds Plastic in 100% of Samples,https://www.ecowatch.com/seafood-study-plastic-contamination-2646982206.html,"A new study of five different kinds of seafood revealed traces of plastic in every sample tested.

Researchers bought raw samples of popular seafood from a market in Australia, including 10 oysters, 10 farmed tiger prawns, 10 wild squid, five wild blue crab and 10 wild sardines, reported Daily Mail. At least trace levels of plastic contamination were found in each, with the highest content found in sardines, according to the research. The scientists used a new technique to identify and measure five different types of plastics contained within the tissues of each sample of seafood simultaneously, reported Intrafish. They did so in order to better understand the potential harm microplastics in seafood could have on human health, lead author Francisca Ribeiro said in a University of Queensland press release.

The study, published by the University of Exeter and the University of Queensland in Environmental Science & Technology, found greatly varying amounts of plastic in each of the different types of seafood tested as well as in the individual species, said a University of Exeter press release. ""From the edible marine species tested, sardines had the highest plastic content, which was a surprising result,"" Riberio told the University of Queensland. ""Another interesting aspect was the diversity of microplastic types found among species, with polyethylene predominant in fish and polyvinyl chloride the only plastic detected in oysters.""

Riberio compared the exposure levels to microplastics in the University of Exeter release: ""Considering an average serving, a seafood eater could be exposed to approximately 0.7mg of plastic when ingesting an average serving of oysters or squid, and up to 30mg of plastic when eating sardines, respectively …. For comparison, 30mg is the average weight of a grain of rice."" The new method is a ""major step forward"" towards plastic quantification techniques in seafood because it allows results to be reported in a mass unit, something wasn't possible before, noted the University of Queensland release. ""We can now define what microplastic levels can be considered harmful to human health,"" Ribeiro said in the release.

The plastics found by the scientists are commonly used in plastic packaging and synthetic textiles, including polystyrene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene and poly (methyl methacrylate), reported Intrafish. Polyvinyl chloride was found in all samples, while the plastic found in highest concentrations was polyethylene, the world's most popular plastic, reported Daily Mail. These plastics frequently end up in waterways and oceans, where they continue to break down into microplastics, very small pieces of plastics that are often eaten by marine creatures of all sizes and types. Microplastics are absorbed by plankton, bioaccumulate as they are carried up the food chain and eventually end up on our plates, reported Energy Live News."
"Chris Hedges: America faces a historic choice — ""ugly corporate tyranny"" or revolution",https://www.salon.com/2020/07/16/chris-hedges-america-faces-a-historic-choice--ugly-corporate-tyranny-or-revolution/,"Time is broken in Donald Trump's America. Minutes feel like hours, hours feel like days. Weeks are months, and months are years. And there is an overwhelming sense of time warped by dread as the country careens towards a dangerous climax on Election Day — whatever the outcome.

Disorientation is a feature of life in a failing democracy where fascism is ascendant.

In a widely read conversation here at Salon during the first few weeks of the national pandemic lockdown and the implosion of America's economy, journalist and bestselling author Chris Hedges warned that, compared to what may lie ahead, ""these were the good times.""

This was before the coronavirus pandemic continued its deadly march where today more than 136,000 people are dead. Hedges' warnings were also made before we saw the full horror of Trump's willful incompetence, cruelty and sabotage, or his willingness to sacrifice millions of Americans — including, potentially, children — for ""the economy,"" capitalism and, of course, his own re-election. Hedges also issued his warning about ""the good times"" before Trump's threats of martial law and using military forces against the George Floyd protests and people's uprising. It was also before Donald Trump declared war on Independence Day weekend against any and all Americans who dare to oppose him.

I reached out to Hedges again and asked him, ""Are these still the good times?""

Yes, he said, they are.

In our latest conversation, Hedges explains why this perilous moment in America will be looked back upon fondly, compared to what the future holds. He sees little hope in Joe Biden and the Democratic Party, which he believes have no substantive solutions for the social inequality and other institutional problems that spawned Donald Trump and his white neofascist movement. Hedges is also concerned that America is spiraling down into the type of ethno-political violence he personally witnessed in Yugoslavia during that country's civil war in the 1990s.

But Hedges also sees hope for saving the United States from imminent tyranny. Where? In the George Floyd protests and the possibility of revolutionary change.

As is customary, this conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

Under Donald Trump's reign, America is a country run by a crime family. Trump and his Republicans have no moral authority. They are removing any oversight by firing inspectors general within the federal government, which has allowed Trump and his allies to loot coronavirus relief funds for billions of dollars. Trump and his cronies rage about ""law and order"" and locking up people who were looting during the George Floyd uprising — when in reality the plutocrats are looting an entire country and have been doing so for decades.

It's a mafia state. There's no control. There's no regulation. The system is full of legalized bribery. The electoral process is corrupt as well. The courts are stacked with right-wing ideologues. The press has been bought off and corporatized. Many of our constitutional rights as Americans have been revoked by judicial fiat, including the right to privacy. Corporate money floods political campaigns in the name of ""free speech."" The United States is a failed democracy and a mafia state, the natural result of what happens when capitalism is deregulated.

Trump, Mitch McConnell, the other Republicans and their gangster capitalist allies are telling the public that $1,200 in coronavirus relief money is adequate. But the billionaires and millionaires are the ones who received the majority of the ""relief"" funds. America's billionaires are now $500 billion richer because of the coronavirus disaster. The average American is closer to homelessness. Neoliberal capitalism amounts to socialism for the rich and ""free markets"" for everyone else.

Mitch McConnell and the other elites really have not figured out what is happening in this moment of great crisis and upheaval. What we are seeing now in America is about so much more than people just being sick of the police murdering innocent people. It is a generational and class revolt. Yes, COVID certainly exacerbated it. But all of the kindling was already there. Chronic underemployment, massive consumer and student debt, being priced out of the for-profit health care system and the expansion of militarized police and the prison system.

This movement is multiracial. It is led by people of color, but certainly, there are a lot of young white people out there too, and my sense is that they are no longer buying into being gaslit by the elites anymore.

The empire always strikes back. What will that look like?

We have to acknowledge that the empire is tottering towards its collapse. So what is empire? Empire is the expression of white supremacy beyond our borders. The whole nature of empire is to go into the Middle East — previously into Vietnam, Latin America, the Philippines and elsewhere — and steal natural resources and exploit cheap labor in the name of white supremacy. And of course, we have an American society built on chattel slavery and genocide against indigenous peoples. What empires traditionally do at the end is they engage in what historians call ""micro-militarism"".

Advertisement:

At the end, as they slip into an irrevocable decline, empires engage in military adventurism in a desperate bid to bring back lost power, lost wealth and lost glory. America has done this in the Middle East. The result is that America has been hollowed out from the inside.

At the end stage, the elites need the tools that the empire perfected on people of color abroad. That is why we see the drones and militarized police and heavy weapons such as armored personnel carriers being used here in America against the country's own citizens.

White supremacy hurts white folks. There are so many examples of this, from the way that federal and state resources are spent putting Black and brown people in prison in disproportionate numbers to how white racism hurts the overall economy. The police in Buffalo intentionally knocking down that older white man, who lay there bleeding from the head while the police walked over him like he was human garbage, was such a profound metaphor for how racism hurts white people. With the George Floyd protests and people's uprising, white folks are seeing, again, that what Black and brown folks have been saying about police thuggery is true. Now the police are brutalizing white people.

People of color always, throughout American history, suffer first. They are the first to suffer — and they suffer disproportionately. But de-industrialization has now hit the white working class. The tools of control are now being used against them. Overall, I don't so much fault the white racists. They are what they are. I fault the white liberals who really did not pay attention to what was happening to primarily poor people of color in urban areas.

Everything that is now enraging white progressives is not new — it goes back decades. But it was never really covered by the mainstream American news media. The liberal elites busied themselves with the boutique activism of ""diversity"" and ""tolerance,"" ""multiculturalism"" and the like. Sure, that is well and good, but not when such approaches are divorced from economic justice.

When you look at these multiracial, intergenerational protests, what do you see?

There has been mass economic disenfranchisement. There is a leadership crisis too among the Democrats and the so-called liberals.

For example, look at what the Congressional Black Caucus is doing. They are repeating the same kind of tired clichés about police reform we have heard for years. Most people participating in the George Floyd protests know that such reforms are useless. Empty symbolism. The mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, paints ""Black Lives Matter"" in 35-foot-tall letters on a street near the White House. But at the same time, she's pushing for a $45 million increase in the police budget and the construction of a $500 million new jail. I don't think people are buying such a performance. I also don't believe that people are buying Pelosi's little kente-cloth, ""take a knee in solidarity with Black Lives Matter"" trick either.

Advertisement:

In part, such actions have no credibility because younger white people no longer buy into the policies of the oligarchs which produced all of this extreme social inequality in the first place. People of color have long known this truth. Now younger white people are being forced into a new type of awareness and consciousness. That is a good thing.

I worry that the Democrats are setting themselves up for great failure and a crushing defeat with all this celebration of how Biden is leading Trump in these early polls. Polls are a snapshot in time. They are not predictive of the outcome on Election Day. Hillary Clinton and Mike Dukakis had double digit leads at various times, and they both lost to Republicans.

As embarrassing and awful as Trump is, he serves corporate power just like Joe Biden. The big corporate Democratic Party donors made it clear that if Bernie Sanders became the presidential nominee, they would support Trump. The donor class has created a system where they cannot fail. If it's Trump or Biden, Goldman Sachs doesn't lose, ExxonMobil doesn't lose, Raytheon doesn't lose, Citibank doesn't lose. There is no way that they can lose. They have rigged the system so that their interests are always served.

Donald Trump tried to order the United States military to attack the American people several weeks ago because they dared to participate in massive protests against police brutality and social inequality. These protests continue and social movement scholars are now saying that the George Floyd protests may be the largest such mobilizations in American history. Trump tried to order martial law and the senior leaders of the United States military basically told him no. On one hand I am glad the military defied Trump. On the other hand, I am deeply concerned about such power in a democracy being normalized. Either way, America is not a healthy democracy.

Advertisement:

The military does not want to be deployed in the streets. At present they are the most respected social and political institution in the country. The military gets even more money than they ask for from the Democrats and the Republicans. The military, quite correctly, saw that it would be disastrous for them to follow Trump's commands to crack down and enact martial law.

As a practical matter, the military does not need to intervene against the George Floyd protesters and others who have taken to the streets because the American police are so highly militarized. In America there are SWAT teams who don't look much different than Army Rangers knocking down doors in Afghanistan.

In many ways, the most potent anti-democratic force in the United States is the military. They are untouchable. The U.S. military cannot even be audited. Such power and influence are a classic symptom of the end of an empire. The Praetorian Guard can no longer be controlled by the supposed political leaders.

There have been incidents across the country in which white mobs attack Black Lives Matter protesters, anti-fascists and other Americans of conscience. These thugs are yelling Trump slogans, wearing his regalia and attacking with baseball bats and other weapons. The Trump street enforcers also have guns. Where do we go from here?

The more beleaguered Donald Trump becomes, the more he and the other racists and nativists will incite violence. America right now reminds me of Yugoslavia during the 1990s.

Donald Trump's supporters are willing to kill and die for him. This is just the beginning of what is going to happen as Election Day approaches. You have been in war zones and countries torn apart by ethnic cleansing and genocide. What is the model for how a people turn on each other?

It begins with economic dysfunction, which is what happened in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia went into de facto bankruptcy. The huge state factories closed, just like they did here in the United States. There was massive unemployment, the social bonds in the country were ruptured. There were bread lines. People lost everything, including a sense of identity. As a result, they retreated into these mythical narratives about themselves as Serbs, Croats and Muslims. In such a moment shared public discourse is impossible. These other identities and their myths have now superseded verifiable historical fact. That's what happened in Yugoslavia, and that is very much part of what is happening in the United States.

Then there is the rise of demagogues who demonize a segment of the population and target them as the Other. Then the eliminationist rhetoric and violent rhetoric begins. After four years, people started shooting each other in Yugoslavia. The United States is approaching that point.

We spoke with each other several months ago during the first few weeks of the national coronavirus lockdown and economic collapse. You told me that as horrible as things were then, it was in fact ""the good times."" Several months have gone by. Is the United States still experiencing ""good times"" as compared to what will happen in the future?

Yes, as compared to what is coming. The elites are not responding rationally to the coronavirus pandemic, the economic devastation and the myriad of other problems facing the United States right now. America's ruling class is doing just what they did in 2008, which is to line their own pockets at the public's expense and to cast the rest of the country — the working poor and the working class — aside as if they were human refuse. That is all very shortsighted, of course, because of the blowback. The ramifications are catastrophic. One would think that America's elites would respond in a smarter way, if even for their own self-preservation. If elected president, Joe Biden certainly isn't going to respond properly.

The George Floyd protests are more accurately described as a generational class revolt. I hope that the protesters and their allies win, because if we do not take power back from this American mafia state then there will be a very ugly type of tyranny in the country.

As Aristotle said, once you have oligarchic rule, there are only two choices. It is revolution or tyranny, and that's it. I'm not naive enough to tell you the revolution is going to win, but I'm going to tell you that if it doesn't win then there will be a very ugly corporate tyranny in the United States.

The American elites, the ruling class, has already rewritten all the laws.They already have the prison cells. They've already militarized the forces of internal security. They've already legitimized the revoking of basic rights like habeas corpus and due process. Americans are already the most watched, monitored, surveilled, photographed population in human history. The forces of tyranny are ready to go.

I'm more optimistic because I see the resistance in the streets, which wasn't there a few weeks and months ago. That's where hope lies. It lies in the streets. And I have got to acknowledge these people. They're mostly young, incredibly courageous, they are out there braving economic misery, arrests, indiscriminate, brutal and often lethal police violence and COVID-19, and they're fighting against injustice and the elites anyway. They're all heroes in my book."
Humanity Has Killed 83% of All Wild Mammals and Half of All Plants: Study,https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/humans-destroyed-83-of-wildlife-report/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=global&utm_campaign=general-content&linkId=77139369&fbclid=IwAR360oZw8rwcpzNFESUmY2SFS4XPAwxzwBC7h2VdFthGpuxk71u1Psq5M1w,"Photo by Tom Skarbek-Wazynski on Unsplash

When it comes to planet Earth, humans are very tiny.

The weight of all 7.6 billion humans makes up just 0.01% of all biomass on Earth, according to a report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.

Bacteria, by comparison, make up 13% of all biomass, plants account for 83%, and all other forms of life make up 5% of the total weight, according to the report.

Take Action: Stand Up for the Arctic

Despite being such a small part of the planet, humans have been steadily destroying everything else for the past few millennia, the Guardian reports.

In fact, humans have caused the annihilation of 83% of all wild mammals and half of all plants, the authors of the report found.

And it’s not just that humans are wiping out wildlife — they’re also determining the animals and plants that remain.

Of the birds left in the world, 70% are poultry chickens and other farmed birds. And of the mammals left in the world, 60% are livestock, 36% are pigs, and a mere 4% are wild.

“It is definitely striking, our disproportionate place on Earth,” Ron Milo, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who led the report, told the Guardian. “When I do a puzzle with my daughters, there is usually an elephant next to a giraffe next to a rhino. But if I was trying to give them a more realistic sense of the world, it would be a cow next to a cow next to a cow and then a chicken.”

This staggering imbalance between domestic and wild animals is being driven by industrial farming, extraction of resources, and the expansion of human civilizations, all of which destroy ecosystems, according to the report.

Other studies have also documented the decline of animals and plants. For instance, scientists recently argued that the Earth is experiencing its sixth mass wave of extinction, with billions of local animal populations endangered around the world.

This decline is by no means slowing down. A study published last week found that if temperatures at the end of the century are 3.2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, species across the animal kingdom could lose up to half of their geographical ranges.

The study spearheaded by Milo, however, is the first taxonomic breakdown of the mass of all organisms on Earth, according to the authors, who noted that further research and advances in technology need to be developed to refine the data.

“I would hope this gives people a perspective on the very dominant role that humanity now plays on Earth,” Milo told the Guardian.

Sir David Attenborough has said it is ‘too late’ to reverse climate change and warned of mass civil unrest if steps aren’t taken to address the crisis.

The broadcaster and natural historian added that ‘the best we can hope is that we will slow it down and slow it down considerably’.

He made the comments during an interview with Channel 4 News.

Jon Snow told the legendary environmentalist an 11-year-old had written in to ask what the worst thing to happen in his life would be ‘if we don’t tackle climate change’.

Sir David replied: ‘I think civil unrest on a great scale, and mass migration on a great scale.

‘I think we will go on finding enough food, though it may not be precisely the choice that we would take freely.’

Asked if it was ‘too late to reverse climate change’, he said: ‘It’s too late to reverse it. Not only in my lifetime, but in the next lifetime.

‘I don’t think you can reverse it. I think the best that we can hope is that we will slow it down, and slow it down considerably.’

Sir David said it was ‘very difficult to detect real action in politicians’, adding that it was ‘really rather sad’ that the first climate debate among party leaders during an election only took place on Channel 4 last week.

He criticised Boris Johnson’s ‘shameful’ decision not to take part in the event, during which he was replaced with an ice sculpture, adding: ‘I don’t know what else he had to do, but it would have to be very, very important to dodge this one.’

When asked whether he thought the public would emerge from such a critical general election ‘with a better understanding of the need to change our ways’, Sir David said he doesn’t.

He said that the problem with short term elections was that politicians ‘think the issues facing the electorate are ones that are going to change their lives tomorrow or the day after, and those are the ones they concentrate on’.

Sir David said: ‘I don’t think things are going to get better. I think we can slow the degree to which they are getting worse.’

Survey: 50% say all their savings will be wiped out by the end of April,https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/Survey-50-say-all-their-savings-will-be-wiped-15188178.php,"Half of the people taking part in a new survey assessing the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on personal finances reported that they believe their savings will run out before the end of April.

Clever, a company that negotiates with real estate agents for lower fees, questioned 1,000 homeowners and renters on March 31 in order to gauge how they have been impacted by the outbreak.

A day before, the St. Louis Fed predicted that 47 million Americans could lose their jobs and that the unemployment rate could exceed 32% before the economic freeze triggered by stay-at-home measures begins to thaw.

Clever’s survey showed that many of its respondents have little in reserve to weather a long recession. The findings include:

—22% of homeowners don’t have enough in savings to cover one month’s mortgage.

—Almost half of renters surveyed reported having less than $500 set aside for emergencies. A similar amount said their savings wouldn’t be enough to cover one month’s rent.

—30% of homeowners had less than $1,000 reserved for emergencies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average homeowner spends just under $6,000 per month, and recommends homeowners have between $17,300 and $35,600 squirrelled away for expenses over 3-6 months in case they have no active income.

—12% of homeowners are already behind on mortgage payments due to the coronavirus crisis. About 27% are worried about defaulting on their mortgages.

—More than half of both renters and homeowners say they are racking up credit card debt to pay bills. Federal stimulus checks of up to $1,200 should provide some relief, but the respite is likely to be temporary.

The survey also found that the real estate market has been thrown into turmoil.

Would-be sellers are taking their homes off the market (23%) or dropping the listing price (27%). Nearly a third were holding off on listing their home.

The majority of buyers, meanwhile, are bailing from house searches, either delaying plans (48%) or giving up altogether (17%). However, about a quarter see the pandemic as a buying opportunity should prices fall enough.

Complete results of Clever’s survey can be found here.

Population panic lets rich people off the hook for the climate crisis they are causing,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/26/panic-overpopulation-climate-crisis-consumption-environment?,"When a major study was published last month, showing that the global population is likely to peak then crash much sooner than most scientists had assumed, I naively imagined that people in rich nations would at last stop blaming all the world’s environmental problems on population growth. I was wrong. If anything, it appears to have got worse.

Next week the BirthStrike movement – founded by women who, by announcing their decision not to have children, seek to focus our minds on the horror of environmental collapse – will dissolve itself, because its cause has been hijacked so virulently and persistently by population obsessives. The founders explain that they had “underestimated the power of ‘overpopulation’ as a growing form of climate breakdown denial”.

It is true that, in some parts of the world, population growth is a major driver of particular kinds of ecological damage, such as the expansion of small-scale agriculture into rainforests, the bushmeat trade and local pressure on water and land for housing. But its global impact is much smaller than many people claim.

The formula for calculating people’s environmental footprint is simple, but widely misunderstood: Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology (I = PAT). The global rate of consumption growth, before the pandemic, was 3% a year. Population growth is 1%. Some people assume this means that the rise in population bears one-third of the responsibility for increased consumption. But population growth is overwhelmingly concentrated among the world’s poorest people, who have scarcely any A or T to multiply their P. The extra resource use and greenhouse gas emissions caused by a rising human population are a tiny fraction of the impact of consumption growth.

Yet it is widely used as a blanket explanation of environmental breakdown. Panic about population growth enables the people most responsible for the impacts of rising consumption (the affluent) to blame those who are least responsible.

At this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, the primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, who is a patron of the charity Population Matters, told the assembled pollutocrats, some of whom have ecological footprints thousands of times greater than the global average: “All these things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.” I doubt that any of those who nodded and clapped were thinking, “yes, I urgently need to disappear”.

In 2019, Goodall appeared in an advertisement for British Airways, whose customers produce more greenhouse gas emissions on one flight than many of the world’s people generate in a year. If we had the global population of 500 years ago (around 500 million), and if it were composed of average UK plane passengers, our environmental impact would probably be greater than that of the 7.8 billion alive today.

She proposed no mechanism by which her dream might come true. This could be the attraction. The very impotence of her call is reassuring to those who don’t want change. If the answer to environmental crisis is to wish other people away, we might as well give up and carry on consuming.

Population, poverty and the climate emergency | Letters Read more

The excessive emphasis on population growth has a grim history. Since the clergymen Joseph Townsend and Thomas Malthus wrote their tracts in the 18th century, poverty and hunger have been blamed not on starvation wages, war, misrule and wealth extraction by the rich, but on the reproduction rates of the poor. Winston Churchill blamed the Bengal famine of 1943, that he helped to cause through the mass export of India’s rice, on the Indians “breeding like rabbits”. In 2013 Sir David Attenborough, also a patron of Population Matters, wrongly blamed famines in Ethiopia on “too many people for too little land”, and suggested that sending food aid was counter-productive.

Another of the charity’s patrons, Paul Ehrlich, whose incorrect predictions about mass famine helped to provoke the current population panic, once argued that the US should “coerce” India into “sterilising all Indian males with three or more children”, by making food aid conditional on this policy. This proposal was similar to the brutal programme that Indira Gandhi later introduced, with financial support from the UN and the World Bank. Foreign aid from the UK was funding crude and dangerous sterilisation in India as recently as 2011, on the grounds that this policy was helping to “fight climate change”. Some of the victims of this programme allege that they were forced to participate. At the same time, the UK government was pouring billions of pounds of aid into developing coal, gas and oil plants, in India and other nations. It blamed the poor for the crisis it was helping to cause.

Malthusianism slides easily into racism. Most of the world’s population growth is happening in the poorest countries, where most people are black or brown. The colonial powers justified their atrocities by fomenting a moral panic about “barbaric”, “degenerate” people “outbreeding” the “superior races”. These claims have been revived today by the far right, who promote conspiracy theories about “white replacement” and “white genocide”. When affluent white people wrongly transfer the blame for their environmental impacts on to the birthrate of much poorer brown and black people, their finger-pointing reinforces these narratives. It is inherently racist.

The far right now uses the population argument to contest immigration into the US and the UK. This too has a grisly heritage: the pioneering conservationist Madison Grant promoted, alongside his environmental work, the idea that the “Nordic master race” was being “overtaken” in the US by “worthless race types”. As president of the Immigration Restriction League, he helped to engineer the vicious 1924 Immigration Act.

But, as there are some genuine ecological impacts of population growth, how do we distinguish proportionate concerns about these harms from deflection and racism? Well, we know that the strongest determinant of falling birth rates is female emancipation and education. The major obstacle to female empowerment is extreme poverty. Its effect is felt disproportionately by women.

So a good way of deciding whether someone’s population concerns are genuine is to look at their record of campaigning against structural poverty. Have they contested the impossible debts poor nations are required to pay? Have they argued against corporate tax avoidance, or extractive industries that drain wealth from poorer countries, leaving almost nothing behind, or the financial sector in Britain’s processing of money stolen abroad? Or have they simply sat and watched as people remain locked in poverty, then complained about their fertility?

Before long, this reproductive panic will disappear. Nations will soon be fighting over immigrants: not to exclude them, but to attract them, as the demographic transition leaves their ageing populations with a shrinking tax base and a dearth of key workers. Until then, we should resist attempts by the rich to demonise the poor.

"We've finally done it guys /s — ""Google searches for ‘climate change’ finally beat out Game of Thrones""",https://grist.org/article/google-searches-for-climate-change-finally-beat-out-game-of-thrones/,"According to your Google searches, September was climate change’s biggest month of all time. For the first time since Game of Thrones became a thing, Americans showed more interest in climate change than the plight of the scattered Stark family.

The peak of climate change queries came the week of September 20, even rising above searches for “impeachment.” That’s the day that millions of young people around the world skipped class for what may well have been the biggest climate change protest in history.

That search spike beat out climate change’s previous high from June 1, 2017, when President Donald Trump announced he intended to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement. The slightly smaller jump in December 2015 came when countries were meeting in Paris to draw up the agreement in the first place.

So what was everybody searching for this September? They were on the hunt for information on protests and rallies tied to the climate strike, according to Google Trends’ publicly available data. Perhaps looking for inspiration for their protest signs, many Americans also searched for “climate change poster.”

September was kind of like one long Super Bowl for climate change, with several events (including the strike) in anticipation of the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City the last weekend of the month. CNN and MSNBC held marathon-length town halls grilling presidential candidates about their plans to take on the climate crisis. Some 300 newsrooms stepped up their reporting on our overheating planet in a collaborative effort called Covering Climate Now. On the science side, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a landmark report that spelled out how climate change is wreaking havoc in our oceans.

And Greta Thunberg paid a visit to the U.S., sailing across the Atlantic Ocean to attend the U.N. summit. The 16-year-old Swedish activist who started the climate strike movement delivered a chilling address to world leaders that went viral. Perhaps that explains the uptick in searches for “climate change girl speech”?

Over the course of the month, the phrase “climate change” was most popular in Washington D.C., Vermont, and Hawaii. Worldwide, the hotspot for climate-related searches was Fiji — an island nation in the South Pacific that’s getting submerged by the rising seas."

"US Town Rejects Solar Farm Amid Worries It Would ""Suck Up All The Energy From The Sun""",https://www.sciencealert.com/us-town-rejects-solar-farm-amid-worries-it-would-suck-up-all-the-energy-from-the-sun,"The town of Woodland, North Carolina is in the spotlight this week after rejecting a proposal to rezone a section of land just outside its borders for the use of a solar farm.

Three solar farms have already been approved in the area, but the local residents are seemingly not impressed. The council defeated the motion for the rezoning of an area on US Highway 258 for an additional solar farm after a public comment period, where members of the town could give their opinions.

A retired science teacher, Jane Mann, said she was concerned about the rising risk of cancer deaths in the area (despite reports showing that cancer rates in North Carolina have fallen over the 2008 to 2012 period) saying that no one could tell her that solar panels were not causing the cancer.

She was also concerned that photosynthesis would slow due to the solar panels, stopping the plants from growing in the solar farm fields. ""I want to know what's going to happen. I want information. Enough is enough. I don't see the profit for the town,"" Mann said at the meeting, according to The Roanoke-Chowan News Herald.

""People come with hidden agendas. Until we can find if anything is going to damage this community, we shouldn't sign any paper,"" she added.

Bobby Mann (it's not clear if he's related to Jane), said that he was worried that local communities would dry up. ""You're killing your town,"" he said. ""All the young people are going to move out.""

He also argued that solar farms would suck up all the energy from the Sun, and new businesses would not come to Woodland.

The area just outside Woodland is a popular spot for solar farm developers, because it has an electrical substation, which means the panels can be hooked up to the national grid. While contruction has started on one of the three farms that have already been approved for the area, it's unlikely this forth one will get the go-ahead.

Unfortunately, this dislike of solar is not new. The New York Times reported in 2011 that when Oradell, New Jersey began putting up solar panels on power poles, many residents were unhappy. ""I hate them,"" Eric Olsen told The New York Times. ""It's just an eyesore.""

Other residents were also reported as calling the panels ""ugly"" or ""hideous"", and said they were worried about their property value declining because of it.

However, these panels pushed New Jersey closer to their renewable energy target, which is one of the highest in the US. As of earlier this year, New Jersey also approved a bill that requires the state to get at least 80 percent of all its energy from renewable sources by 2050.

And not all New Jersey residents have been against these changes, with some seeing the panels as a badge of pride representing their switch to clean energy.

Hopefully, with increased exposure and better education, we can outline the positives of having solar panels installed in both big cities and country towns. We don't want another fiasco like this Wind Turbine Syndrome travesty."
"""Shocking"": Nearly all who recovered from Covid-19 have health issues months later",https://nltimes.nl/2020/06/12/shocking-nearly-recovered-covid-19-health-issues-months-later,"Many recovered coronavirus patients who did not need to be hospitalized are still facing serious health problems months later, according to a study commissioned by the Longfonds. While 94 percent say they do not feel as healthy as they did before the viral infection, some 60 percent of this group said they still have breathing symptoms which make it difficult to take a walk, and nearly half are unable to exercise, Longfonds director Michael Rutgers said in a statement. ""We find this really shocking.""

The Longfonds, treatment center CIRO, and Maastricht University surveyed 1,600 people who reported they had symptoms after recovering from the coronavirus. Rutgers said it was the first time that these patients have really come into the picture, as most were never treated in medical centers. Longfonds and CIRO said 91 percent of respondents were not hospitalized, and 43 percent were never formally tested for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by this SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

These recovered patients told researchers that they still suffer from symptoms like tightness in the chest, fatigue, headaches, or shortness of breath almost three months after recovering. 85 percent of participants said they were in good health before getting the coronavirus. Only six percent said that their health is back to what it was before their infection. The average age of those surveyed was 53.

These people really need to be seen, heard and helped,” Rutgers said. More than 1 in 5 received no follow up care, and were thoroughly dissatisfied by that. ""It seems that we are dealing with an invisible group of patients who are in danger of falling through the cracks after coronavirus. We have to prevent that.""

""The health of corona patients who went through corona at home is shockingly bad,"" Rutgers said ""Until now, the focus was rightly on the people who ended up in the hospital or even on the ICU. But we should not forget this group of corona patients who were at home.""

Longfonds wanted more people to register with the Dutch-language platform Coronalongplein.nl, which it launched along with another pulmonary organization to provide information and advice to people struggling with the aftereffects of a Covid-19 infection. Through the site they can use their PGO personal health monitor questionnaire to determine the severity of their own symptoms.

""We are learning more and more about the course of the disease. The questions and complaints must guide the care, treatment and supervision of this new patient group. In addition, further research into the long-term consequences of coronavirus is needed,"" Rutgers said."
"Climate change now irreversible due to warming oceans, UN body warns",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/09/25/climate-change-now-irreversible-due-warming-oceans-un-body-warns,"Climate change is now irreversible, thanks to ocean warming crossing a “tipping point”, UN experts have warned.

A new report predicts that, even with significant emission cuts, sea levels will rise by the end of the century, with serious coastal flooding becoming hundreds of times more frequent.

The planet has warmed to 1C above pre-industrial temperatures, and around 90 per cent of that excess heat has been absorbed by the oceans, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said.

It means rapidly melting ice in Antarctica and Greenland is now pushing up sea levels by 3.6mm a year, at twice the rate of the Twentieth Century.

Despite commitments by the UK, French and other governments to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in coming decades, the analysis predicts that there is too much heat in the oceans to prevent disruption for hundreds of millions of people.

Unveiling the latest report in Monaco on Wednesday, panel-member Valerie Masson-Delmotte, said: “Climate change is already irreversible due to the heat uptake in the ocean.

“We can’t go back, whatever we do with our emissions.”

According to the new forecasts, approximately 70 per cent of the world’s permafrost will thaw if emissions continue to rise. This in turn could free up “tens to hundreds of billions of tonnes” of CO2 and methane into the atmosphere, further heating the planet."
‘I Can’t Keep Doing This:’ Small-Business Owners Are Giving Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/business/small-businesses-coronavirus.html,"It was harrowing enough for small businesses — the bars, dental care practices, small law firms, day care centers and other storefronts that dot the streets and corners of every American town and city — to have to shut down after state officials imposed lockdowns in March to contain the pandemic.

But the resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent.

Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. From June 15 to June 29, the most recent period for which data is available, businesses were closing permanently at a higher rate than in the previous three months, Yelp found. During the same period, permanent closures increased by 3 percent overall, accounting for roughly 14 percent of total closures since March.

Researchers at Harvard believe the rates of business closures are likely to be even higher. They estimated that nearly 110,000 small businesses across the country had decided to shut down permanently between early March and early May, based on data collected in weekly surveys by Alignable, a social media network for small-business owners.

Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers, said it was difficult to accurately gauge how many small businesses were closing because, once they shut their doors for good, the owners were hard to reach. He added that it could take up to a year before government officials knew the true toll the pandemic was taking on small businesses."
Revealed: US listed climate activist group as 'extremists' alongside mass killers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/us-listed-climate-activist-group-extremists,"A group of US environmental activists engaged in non-violent civil disobedience targeting the oil industry have been listed in internal Department of Homeland Security documents as “extremists” and some of its members listed alongside white nationalists and mass killers, documents obtained by the Guardian reveal.

The group have been dubbed the Valve Turners, after closing the valves on pipelines in four states carrying crude oil from Canada’s tar sands on 11 October 2016 which accounted for about 15% of US daily consumption. It was described as the largest coordinated action of its kind and for a few hours the oil stopped flowing.

The five climate activists, members of Climate Direct Action, cut their way through fencing and turned the valves. The activists notified the energy companies whose pipelines were being disrupted and posted videos of their protest online and waited patiently to be arrested.

They have since been dubbed the “Valve Turners”, profiled in the New York Times magazine and featured in a recent documentary titled The Reluctant Radical. Their trials have also tested the willingness of courts to allow climate activists to make use of the necessity defense – the idea that a criminal action is justified if it helps to prevent greater future harm – as part of a legal strategy.

But the group’s actions attracted the attention of the DHS.

In a recent intelligence bulletin evaluating domestic terrorism threats between 2018 and 2020, the department included the Valve Turners and described the group as “suspected environmental rights extremists”.

The document also listed two of the group’s members alongside violent white supremacists and other extremists who have engaged in mass killings, including the man behind the racist 2015 slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.

The document obtained by the not-for-profit Property of the People through a Foia request defines domestic terrorism as “any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources” and that is intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or government body. The assessment is directed at departmental leadership and is based on a review of roughly 80 violent incidents between 2014 and 2017, according to the document.

The document points to an uptick in “sabotage attacks” conducted by anarchist extremists, environmental rights and animal rights extremists against the Dakota Access pipeline in 2016 at the height of the pipeline protest. Nearly 800 activists have been tried on a variety of North Dakota state charges, in relation to the pipeline protests, according to Water Protector Legal Collective, a legal support organization.

This activity was met with heavy law enforcement presence, FBI and DHS surveillance, and aggressive military style tactics deployed by pipeline security contractors.

In addition to providing an overview of domestic terrorism threats the document includes an appendix summarizing select incidents over the past few years. Two of the Valve Turners are listed alongside violent white supremacists such as Dylann Roof and James Fields, who have both been convicted of murdering innocent civilians. Roof killed nine black churchgoers in a rampage in South Carolina. Fields drove his car into a group of activists protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring at least 19 others.

The document also states that “racial and environmentally themed ideologies” were among the primary drivers of terrorist attacks in the United States during this time.

Mike German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in an email that

the DHS framing was “highly misleading because white supremacists are responsible for the bulk of this violence and almost all of the fatalities that result”. “There is little evidence,” he added, “that environmentalists have engaged in the types of deadly violence that would meet the statutory definition of domestic terrorism, as codified by Congress”.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Sam Jessup, one of the activists named in the document, said the bulletin shed light on the role law enforcement and intelligence agencies have played in suppressing dissent.

“Equating mass murder by white supremacists with what Michael and I did is totally obscene,” Jessup said in an email. “This whole infrastructure of so-called security has done little more than secure the future of the fossil fuel industry by terrorizing people into silence.”

Jessup, 34, served as a driver and videographer, live-streaming the action in North Dakota. Michael Foster, a former family therapist who lives in Seattle, turned the valve.

Foster said even though the action involved a high level of legal risk, it was a small price to pay in light of the cascading impacts of climate change.

“The only way to force society to change fast enough is to refuse to participate and fill the jails,” Foster said.

Both he and Jessup were convicted on felony conspiracy charges and Foster spent six months in jail. During closing arguments the prosecutor compared Foster to the Unabomber and the 9/11 hijackers. He is now on probation and barred from engaging in direct action protest for another two years.

In the more than three years since the action , several states have passed legislation making it a crime to trespass on property containing critical infrastructure.The Trump administration has advocated for stiffer penalties against activists who engage in non-violent direct action targeting fossil fuel infrastructure.

Carl Williams, executive director of the Water Protector Legal Collective, which has defended a number of DAPL protesters, says the push to criminalize dissent is part of a larger rightwing strategy that has also targeted the BDS movement and Black Lives Matter.

“I think there is a strategy that rightwing forces are using to criminalize dissent,” Williams said. “This bulletin shows that dirty hand.”

But Williams also says it shows that these same movements are making inroads. “Liberation movements know that this is happening and we’re fighting against it,” he said. “They’re doing this because they’re afraid of the power of these movements.”

"""The rainforest is not like some Notre Dame that can be rebuilt. Once it has gone, it will be gone and the world – and you – will suffer. Heed our warning.

Robbed of their land and driven from their homes, the last of the Amazon’s Povo Jiahui tribe are under no illusions about the threat of death they face.

As guardians of the rainforest for centuries, they have protected the planet, saving vast swathes of land from deforestation and burning.

Together with 304 other indigenous tribes in Brazil, they have helped defend the 2.1 million square miles of trees that produce more than 6% of the Earth’s oxygen.

Now their efforts, not to mention their very existence, are under threat as fires continue to rage in the Amazon. The Mirror travelled to the rainforest to see for itself the devastation left by the blazes – many of which have been started deliberately – that have left the Earth’s lungs choking.

And as I stand in Humaita Forest, in the state of Amazonas, northwestern Brazil, mankind’s mistreatment of nature could not be more stark.

We met the chief of the Povo Jiahui, Pedro Diarroi, who has a message for the world.

His men are preparing to fight to the death to save the rainforest from armed land-grabbers who set fires to clear the land, then sell it on illegally to ranchers and farmers. They are wreaking destruction on legally protected reserves for indigenous tribes.

Pedro said: “The Amazon for indigenous people is like the church, and now it’s being set on fire. Although you may not pray here, it is a place of worship the world cannot afford to lose.

“The common enemy is the non-indigenous people who have invaded our lands and are now burning even those small parts of the forests where we live and that are protected.

“The rainforest is not like some Notre Dame that can be rebuilt. Once it has gone, it will be gone and the world – and you – will suffer. Heed our warning. The time to act is now.

“We must all save the Amazon for it is she who will save the planet.”

Rainforests, of which the Amazon is the biggest, are vital for sustaining life on Earth, and helping to curb climate change. Their trees produce oxygen, but also capture greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.

This stops the gases from building up in the atmosphere and warming the Earth to dangerous levels. But, with the Amazon burning, levels of carbon dioxide are at their highest ever.

Pedro and his tribe are breathing in carbon dioxide and other dangerous chemicals and gases from the smoke and ash that has engulfed the region.

Along with Pedro’s sons, 15 other families make up the Povo Jiahui tribe.

And, if the smoke doesn’t kill them, they believe they face genocide at the hands of Brazil’s leaders.

For decades, their remoteness has protected them. But, as fires clear more and more land, they are increasingly exposed.

Armed land-grabbers, known as grileiros – emboldened by Brazil’s new far-right president Jair Bolsonaro – are responsible for many of the blazes, burning thousands of acres of forest to make room for cattle and crops.

Bolsonaro supports landowners over indigenous people, who he has compared to animals trapped in the zoo. He has threatened to revoke the protected status of tribal reserves.

The protection of indigenous land is guaranteed by the Brazilian constitution to preserve 305 tribes, who have been persecuted for centuries. Any lessening of rights for the tribes poses a dire threat to both them and the Amazon.

Along with the fires, the forest is being cut down by cattle ranchers, farmers and mining companies.

Bolsonaro’s stance has emboldened the grileiros, and violence has surged since his 2018 election.

Elton Diarroi, Pedro’s eldest son and heir to the tribe, said: “With Bolsonaro, the grileiros feel untouchable. They act with impunity.

“The river of the Amazon will run red with the blood of the indigenous people, and nothing will be done to stop unless we fight back. Bolsonaro treats us like animals. We are prepared to die for our land.

“This is not a fight just for us, it is a fight everyone on the planet should have an interest in. If we lose this, the world loses too. There will be no coming back. The Amazon is not just Brazil’s, it is for everyone.”

Elton said land-grabbers cut down trees, burn undergrowth and plant grass for cattle grazing. The lands are often sold several times over on the black market, meaning that poor states lose out on vital tax revenue.

Tribes in some areas have reported seeing land-grabbers setting their land ablaze, and then preventing firefighters from accessing the area.

Tainaky Tenetehar, of the Guardians of the Forest – a volunteer indigenous force that patrols reserves – said: “To make it harder, they are stopping the indigenous fire brigade from combating the fires.”

The Co-ordinating Body of Indigenous Organisations in the Brazilian Amazon said: “The fires are destroying the remaining forests in these regions, which are vital spaces for the survival of our relatives.”

Antenor Vaz, a consultant on isolated indigenous peoples, said NASA satellite images showed that fires broke out in 131 indigenous reserves from 15-20 August alone.

Since the beginning of the year, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research has reported some 90,000 fires raging across the country.

This is on top of an 80% increase in deforestation so far this year compared with 2018. As we drive more than 1,000 miles through the rainforest, evidence of fire is everywhere, with trees that once stood more than 100ft tall now lying like cremated corpses on the ground.

The acrid smoke has covered nearly half the country. In Sao Paulo, more than 1,700 miles away, stark images show the skies pitch-black in mid-afternoon, the sun partially obscured by ash clouds. As the blazes continue, a growing number of scientists are concerned about the Amazon disappearing completely.

The climate crisis, along with the fires and other human influences, appear to be on the verge of triggering a significant change in the region’s weather system. Opinions vary, but some scientists say it is imminent.

Research suggests that the entire area could begin to self-destruct, in a process of self-perpetuating deforestation known as dieback.

Not only would the region no longer absorb greenhouse gases, but even more emissions would be created as the felled trees would begin to release the carbon they’ve been storing, or as they rot or burn on the forest floor.

The fires also present a huge danger to the Amazon’s ecosystem, threatening already endangered species. Roberto Troya, Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Wildlife Fund says we should expect a significant loss of wildlife.

The Amazon contains one in 10 known species on Earth, according to the WWF. It is difficult to know which species are most at risk until scientists assess the size and distribution of the fires and the animal population.

But while experts wait to assess the information, those who live here are under no doubt about the human impact on the rainforest.

Iooan, the head of the nomadic Piraha tribe on the banks of the Maici River, says that, in the past 10 years, the once-abundant resources they lived off are slowly dying out.

They once easily hunted monkeys, fish, wild pig, capybara, giant river otter and caiman, but now they have to travel for days to find food.

He told the Mirror: “When you cut down the trees, burn our lands, drive us from our homes, it is an attack on the spirits of our ancestors.

“As you take the minerals from our lands, pour poisons into the rivers, you weaken the plants, the animals and the Earth itself.

“When you weaken the land like that, it begins to die. If the land dies, if our Earth dies, then none of us will be able to live, and we too will all die.

Dropped emissions during COVID-19 lockdown will do 'nothing' for climate change,https://www.space.com/coronavirus-emissions-drop-wont-help-climate-change.html,"A view from space of how emissions are changing in response to coronavirus.

While greenhouse gas emissions plummeted as the world locked down in response to the coronavirus pandemic, such dips will do ""nothing"" to slow climate change unless society moves away from fossil fuels, researchers have found.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a pandemic, which it remains today. To slow the spread of the virus, countries around the world began implementing lockdown measures that limited travel and closed down factories and businesses. In turn, Earth-orbiting satellites saw a dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.

However, according to an international study led by the University of Leeds, unless large-scale, structural interventions — like a significant switch away from fossil fuels — are implemented, these changes will not affect Earth's climate. In fact, the researchers found, even if lockdown measures continue in some fashion around the world until the end of 2021, more than a year and half total, global temperatures will only be roughly 0.018 degrees Fahrenheit (0.01 degrees Celsius) lower than expected by 2030.

""Lockdown showed that we can change and change fast, but it also showed the limits of behavior change,"" Piers Forster, study co-author and director of the Priestley International Center for Climate at Britain's University of Leeds, told AFP .

""Without underlying structural change we won't make it,"" he said, referring to climate goals.

Climate work to do

Scientists have identified a temperature rise to ""well below"" 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) above levels before the Industrial Revolution as a major climate target. Some countries are striving to keep temperature rise smaller, below 2.7 degrees F (1.5 degrees C). However, according to these researchers, this goal will be difficult to reach.

""If I'm brutally honest, the world is unlikely to decarbonize at the rates required for 1.5 C, but getting anywhere close will make our children's future better,"" Forster said.

To see exactly how lockdown has affected emissions and climate in the long term, the researchers used open-source data to calculate exactly how the emission levels of 10 different greenhouse gases and air pollutants changed between February and June 2020 in over 120 countries. During those four months, the scientists found that production of pollutants including carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides dropped by between 10% and 30%, a significant decrease.

However, the researchers found that the temporary emissions drop alone wouldn't have a significant impact on climate because these lockdown efforts are temporary, as opposed to larger, long-term structural changes.

""The fall in emissions we experienced during COVID-19 is temporary and therefore it will do nothing to slow down climate change,"" co-author Corinne Le Quere from the University of East Anglia said in the same statement.

In addition to measuring the effects of this temporary lockdown, the researchers also modeled how climate would be impacted if, after this lockdown period, larger changes like reduced use of fossil fuels were implemented around the world. The team highlighted that significant, government-led changes to reduce fossil fuel use would have a lasting, positive effect on climate.

The scientists found that if invested 1.2% of gross domestic product in low-carbon technology post-lockdown, they could cut their emissions in half by 2030 compared with if countries continued to rely on fossil fuels as they do post-lockdown.

""The government responses could be a turning point if they focus on a green recovery, helping to avoid severe impacts from climate change,"" Le Quere said.

"US weekly jobless claims soar to a record-breaking 3.28 million, vs 1.5 million expected",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/weekly-jobless-claims.html,"Americans displaced by the coronavirus crisis filed unemployment claims in record numbers last week, with the Labor Department reporting Thursday a surge to 3.28 million. The number shatters the Great Recession peak of 665,000 in March 2009 and the all-time mark of 695,000 in October 1982. The previous week, which reflected the period before the worst of the coronavirus hit, was 282,000, which was higher than expected at the time. Consensus estimates from economists surveyed by Dow Jones showed an expectation for 1.5 million new claims, though individual forecasts on Wall Street had been anticipating a much higher number. The surge comes amid a crippling slowdown brought on by the coronavirus crisis.

The four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly distortions, was 1,731,000, an increase of 27,500 from the previous week's revised average. Despite the news being even worse than expected, the maj or stock indexes opened more than 2% higher, wiping ut what had been sharp earlier losses. ""This was way bigger than we thought and the market's still moving higher,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. ""That's a very encouraging sign that we may be in a bottoming process.""

His award-winning books include “Into the Silence” and “The Wayfinders.” His new book, “Magdalena: River of Dreams,” is published by Knopf.

Never in our lives have we experienced such a global phenomenon. For the first time in the history of the world, all of humanity, informed by the unprecedented reach of digital technology, has come together, focused on the same existential threat, consumed by the same fears and uncertainties, eagerly anticipating the same, as yet unrealized, promises of medical science.

In a single season, civilization has been brought low by a microscopic parasite 10,000 times smaller than a grain of salt. COVID-19 attacks our physical bodies, but also the cultural foundations of our lives, the toolbox of community and connectivity that is for the human what claws and teeth represent to the tiger.

Our interventions to date have largely focused on mitigating the rate of spread, flattening the curve of morbidity. There is no treatment at hand, and no certainty of a vaccine on the near horizon. The fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps. It took four years. COVID-19 killed 100,000 Americans in four months. There is some evidence that natural infection may not imply immunity, leaving some to question how effective a vaccine will be, even assuming one can be found. And it must be safe. If the global population is to be immunized, lethal complications in just one person in a thousand would imply the death of millions.

Pandemics and plagues have a way of shifting the course of history, and not always in a manner immediately evident to the survivors. In the 14th Century, the Black Death killed close to half of Europe’s population. A scarcity of labor led to increased wages. Rising expectations culminated in the Peasants Revolt of 1381, an inflection point that marked the beginning of the end of the feudal order that had dominated medieval Europe for a thousand years.

The COVID pandemic will be remembered as such a moment in history, a seminal event whose significance will unfold only in the wake of the crisis. It will mark this era much as the 1914 assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the stock market crash of 1929, and the 1933 ascent of Adolf Hitler became fundamental benchmarks of the last century, all harbingers of greater and more consequential outcomes.

COVID’s historic significance lies not in what it implies for our daily lives. Change, after all, is the one constant when it comes to culture. All peoples in all places at all times are always dancing with new possibilities for life. As companies eliminate or downsize central offices, employees work from home, restaurants close, shopping malls shutter, streaming brings entertainment and sporting events into the home, and airline travel becomes ever more problematic and miserable, people will adapt, as we’ve always done. Fluidity of memory and a capacity to forget is perhaps the most haunting trait of our species. As history confirms, it allows us to come to terms with any degree of social, moral, or environmental degradation.

To be sure, financial uncertainty will cast a long shadow. Hovering over the global economy for some time will be the sober realization that all the money in the hands of all the nations on Earth will never be enough to offset the losses sustained when an entire world ceases to function, with workers and businesses everywhere facing a choice between economic and biological survival.

Unsettling as these transitions and circumstances will be, short of a complete economic collapse, none stands out as a turning point in history. But what surely does is the absolutely devastating impact that the pandemic has had on the reputation and international standing of the United States of America.

In a dark season of pestilence, COVID has reduced to tatters the illusion of American exceptionalism. At the height of the crisis, with more than 2,000 dying each day, Americans found themselves members of a failed state, ruled by a dysfunctional and incompetent government largely responsible for death rates that added a tragic coda to America’s claim to supremacy in the world.

For the first time, the international community felt compelled to send disaster relief to Washington. For more than two centuries, reported the Irish Times, “the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the U.S. until now: pity.” As American doctors and nurses eagerly awaited emergency airlifts of basic supplies from China, the hinge of history opened to the Asian century.

No empire long endures, even if few anticipate their demise. Every kingdom is born to die. The 15th century belonged to the Portuguese, the 16th to Spain, 17th to the Dutch. France dominated the 18th and Britain the 19th. Bled white and left bankrupt by the Great War, the British maintained a pretense of domination as late as 1935, when the empire reached its greatest geographical extent. By then, of course, the torch had long passed into the hands of America.

In 1940, with Europe already ablaze, the United States had a smaller army than either Portugal or Bulgaria. Within four years, 18 million men and women would serve in uniform, with millions more working double shifts in mines and factories that made America, as President Roosevelt promised, the arsenal of democracy.

When the Japanese within six weeks of Pearl Harbor took control of 90 percent of the world’s rubber supply, the U.S. dropped the speed limit to 35 mph to protect tires, and then, in three years, invented from scratch a synthetic-rubber industry that allowed Allied armies to roll over the Nazis. At its peak, Henry Ford’s Willow Run Plant produced a B-24 Liberator every two hours, around the clock. Shipyards in Long Beach and Sausalito spat out Liberty ships at a rate of two a day for four years; the record was a ship built in four days, 15 hours and 29 minutes. A single American factory, Chrysler’s Detroit Arsenal, built more tanks than the whole of the Third Reich.

In the wake of the war, with Europe and Japan in ashes, the United States with but 6 percent of the world’s population accounted for half of the global economy, including the production of 93 percent of all automobiles. Such economic dominance birthed a vibrant middle class, a trade union movement that allowed a single breadwinner with limited education to own a home and a car, support a family, and send his kids to good schools. It was not by any means a perfect world but affluence allowed for a truce between capital and labor, a reciprocity of opportunity in a time of rapid growth and declining income inequality, marked by high tax rates for the wealthy, who were by no means the only beneficiaries of a golden age of American capitalism.

But freedom and affluence came with a price. The United States, virtually a demilitarized nation on the eve of the Second World War, never stood down in the wake of victory. To this day, American troops are deployed in 150 countries. Since the 1970s, China has not once gone to war; the U.S. has not spent a day at peace. President Jimmy Carter recently noted that in its 242-year history, America has enjoyed only 16 years of peace, making it, as he wrote, “the most warlike nation in the history of the world.” Since 2001, the U.S. has spent over $6 trillion on military operations and war, money that might have been invested in the infrastructure of home. China, meanwhile, built its nation, pouring more cement every three years than America did in the entire 20th century.

As America policed the world, the violence came home. On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, the Allied death toll was 4,414; in 2019, domestic gun violence had killed that many American men and women by the end of April. By June of that year, guns in the hands of ordinary Americans had caused more casualties than the Allies suffered in Normandy in the first month of a campaign that consumed the military strength of five nations.

More than any other country, the United States in the post-war era lionized the individual at the expense of community and family. It was the sociological equivalent of splitting the atom. What was gained in terms of mobility and personal freedom came at the expense of common purpose. In wide swaths of America, the family as an institution lost its grounding. By the 1960s, 40 percent of marriages were ending in divorce. Only six percent of American homes had grandparents living beneath the same roof as grandchildren; elders were abandoned to retirement homes.

With slogans like “24/7” celebrating complete dedication to the workplace, men and women exhausted themselves in jobs that only reinforced their isolation from their families. The average American father spends less than 20 minutes a day in direct communication with his child. By the time a youth reaches 18, he or she will have spent fully two years watching television or staring at a laptop screen, contributing to an obesity epidemic that the Joint Chiefs have called a national security crisis.

Only half of Americans report having meaningful, face-to-face social interactions on a daily basis. The nation consumes two-thirds of the world’s production of antidepressant drugs. The collapse of the working-class family has been responsible in part for an opioid crisis that has displaced car accidents as the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.

At the root of this transformation and decline lies an ever-widening chasm between Americans who have and those who have little or nothing. Economic disparities exist in all nations, creating a tension that can be as disruptive as the inequities are unjust. In any number of settings, however, the negative forces tearing apart a society are mitigated or even muted if there are other elements that reinforce social solidarity — religious faith, the strength and comfort of family, the pride of tradition, fidelity to the land, a spirit of place.

But when all the old certainties are shown to be lies, when the promise of a good life for a working family is shattered as factories close and corporate leaders, growing wealthier by the day, ship jobs abroad, the social contract is irrevocably broken. For two generations, America has celebrated globalization with iconic intensity, when, as any working man or woman can see, it’s nothing more than capital on the prowl in search of ever cheaper sources of labor.

For many years, those on the conservative right in the United States have invoked a nostalgia for the 1950s, and an America that never was, but has to be presumed to have existed to rationalize their sense of loss and abandonment, their fear of change, their bitter resentments and lingering contempt for the social movements of the 1960s, a time of new aspirations for women, gays, and people of color. In truth, at least in economic terms, the country of the 1950s resembled Denmark as much as the America of today. Marginal tax rates for the wealthy were 90 percent. The salaries of CEOs were, on average, just 20 times that of their mid-management employees.

Today, the base pay of those at the top is commonly 400 times that of their salaried staff, with many earning orders of magnitude more in stock options and perks. The elite one percent of Americans control $30 trillion of assets, while the bottom half have more debt than assets. The three richest Americans have more money than the poorest 160 million of their countrymen. Fully a fifth of American households have zero or negative net worth, a figure that rises to 37 percent for black families. The median wealth of black households is a tenth that of whites. The vast majority of Americans — white, black, and brown — are two paychecks removed from bankruptcy. Though living in a nation that celebrates itself as the wealthiest in history, most Americans live on a high wire, with no safety net to brace a fall.

With the COVID crisis, 40 million Americans lost their jobs, and 3.3 million businesses shut down, including 41 percent of all black-owned enterprises. Black Americans, who significantly outnumber whites in federal prisons despite being but 13 percent of the population, are suffering shockingly high rates of morbidity and mortality, dying at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The cardinal rule of American social policy — don’t let any ethnic group get below the blacks, or allow anyone to suffer more indignities — rang true even in a pandemic, as if the virus was taking its cues from American history.

COVID-19 didn’t lay America low; it simply revealed what had long been forsaken. As the crisis unfolded, with another American dying every minute of every day, a country that once turned out fighter planes by the hour could not manage to produce the paper masks or cotton swabs essential for tracking the disease. The nation that defeated smallpox and polio, and led the world for generations in medical innovation and discovery, was reduced to a laughing stock as a buffoon of a president advocated the use of household disinfectants as a treatment for a disease that intellectually he could not begin to understand.

As a number of countries moved expeditiously to contain the virus, the United States stumbled along in denial, as if willfully blind. With less than four percent of the global population, the U.S. soon accounted for more than a fifth of COVID deaths. The percentage of American victims of the disease who died was six times the global average. Achieving the world’s highest rate of morbidity and mortality provoked not shame, but only further lies, scapegoating, and boasts of miracle cures as dubious as the claims of a carnival barker, a grifter on the make.

As the United States responded to the crisis like a corrupt tin pot dictatorship, the actual tin pot dictators of the world took the opportunity to seize the high ground, relishing a rare sense of moral superiority, especially in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The autocratic leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, chastised America for “maliciously violating ordinary citizens’ rights.” North Korean newspapers objected to “police brutality” in America. Quoted in the Iranian press, Ayatollah Khamenei gloated, “America has begun the process of its own destruction.”

Trump’s performance and America’s crisis deflected attention from China’s own mishandling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, not to mention its move to crush democracy in Hong Kong. When an American official raised the issue of human rights on Twitter, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, invoking the killing of George Floyd, responded with one short phrase, “I can’t breathe.”

These politically motivated remarks may be easy to dismiss. But Americans have not done themselves any favors. Their political process made possible the ascendancy to the highest office in the land a national disgrace, a demagogue as morally and ethically compromised as a person can be. As a British writer quipped, “there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid”.

The American president lives to cultivate resentments, demonize his opponents, validate hatred. His main tool of governance is the lie; as of July 9th, 2020, the documented tally of his distortions and false statements numbered 20,055. If America’s first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie, the current one can’t recognize the truth. Inverting the words and sentiments of Abraham Lincoln, this dark troll of a man celebrates malice for all, and charity for none.

Odious as he may be, Trump is less the cause of America’s decline than a product of its descent. As they stare into the mirror and perceive only the myth of their exceptionalism, Americans remain almost bizarrely incapable of seeing what has actually become of their country. The republic that defined the free flow of information as the life blood of democracy, today ranks 45th among nations when it comes to press freedom. In a land that once welcomed the huddled masses of the world, more people today favor building a wall along the southern border than supporting health care and protection for the undocumented mothers and children arriving in desperation at its doors. In a complete abandonment of the collective good, U.S. laws define freedom as an individual’s inalienable right to own a personal arsenal of weaponry, a natural entitlement that trumps even the safety of children; in the past decade alone 346 American students and teachers have been shot on school grounds.

The American cult of the individual denies not just community but the very idea of society. No one owes anything to anyone. All must be prepared to fight for everything: education, shelter, food, medical care. What every prosperous and successful democracy deems to be fundamental rights — universal health care, equal access to quality public education, a social safety net for the weak, elderly, and infirmed — America dismisses as socialist indulgences, as if so many signs of weakness.

How can the rest of the world expect America to lead on global threats — climate change, the extinction crisis, pandemics — when the country no longer has a sense of benign purpose, or collective well-being, even within its own national community? Flag-wrapped patriotism is no substitute for compassion; anger and hostility no match for love. Those who flock to beaches, bars, and political rallies, putting their fellow citizens at risk, are not exercising freedom; they are displaying, as one commentator has noted, the weakness of a people who lack both the stoicism to endure the pandemic and the fortitude to defeat it. Leading their charge is Donald Trump, a bone spur warrior, a liar and a fraud, a grotesque caricature of a strong man, with the backbone of a bully.

Over the last months, a quip has circulated on the internet suggesting that to live in Canada today is like owning an apartment above a meth lab. Canada is no perfect place, but it has handled the COVID crisis well, notably in British Columbia, where I live. Vancouver is just three hours by road north of Seattle, where the U.S. outbreak began. Half of Vancouver’s population is Asian, and typically dozens of flights arrive each day from China and East Asia. Logically, it should have been hit very hard, but the health care system performed exceedingly well. Throughout the crisis, testing rates across Canada have been consistently five times that of the U.S. On a per capita basis, Canada has suffered half the morbidity and mortality. For every person who has died in British Columbia, 44 have perished in Massachusetts, a state with a comparable population that has reported more COVID cases than all of Canada. As of July 30th, even as rates of COVID infection and death soared across much of the United States, with 59,629 new cases reported on that day alone, hospitals in British Columbia registered a total of just five COVID patients.

When American friends ask for an explanation, I encourage them to reflect on the last time they bought groceries at their neighborhood Safeway. In the U.S. there is almost always a racial, economic, cultural, and educational chasm between the consumer and the check-out staff that is difficult if not impossible to bridge. In Canada, the experience is quite different. One interacts if not as peers, certainly as members of a wider community. The reason for this is very simple. The checkout person may not share your level of affluence, but they know that you know that they are getting a living wage because of the unions. And they know that you know that their kids and yours most probably go to the same neighborhood public school. Third, and most essential, they know that you know that if their children get sick, they will get exactly the same level of medical care not only of your children but of those of the prime minister. These three strands woven together become the fabric of Canadian social democracy.

Asked what he thought of Western civilization, Mahatma Gandhi famously replied, “I think that would be a good idea.” Such a remark may seem cruel, but it accurately reflects the view of America today as seen from the perspective of any modern social democracy. Canada performed well during the COVID crisis because of our social contract, the bonds of community, the trust for each other and our institutions, our health care system in particular, with hospitals that cater to the medical needs of the collective, not the individual, and certainly not the private investor who views every hospital bed as if a rental property. The measure of wealth in a civilized nation is not the currency accumulated by the lucky few, but rather the strength and resonance of social relations and the bonds of reciprocity that connect all people in common purpose.

This has nothing to do with political ideology, and everything to do with the quality of life. Finns live longer and are less likely to die in childhood or in giving birth than Americans. Danes earn roughly the same after-tax income as Americans, while working 20 percent less. They pay in taxes an extra 19 cents for every dollar earned. But in return they get free health care, free education from pre-school through university, and the opportunity to prosper in a thriving free-market economy with dramatically lower levels of poverty, homelessness, crime, and inequality. The average worker is paid better, treated more respectfully, and rewarded with life insurance, pension plans, maternity leave, and six weeks of paid vacation a year. All of these benefits only inspire Danes to work harder, with fully 80 percent of men and women aged 16 to 64 engaged in the labor force, a figure far higher than that of the United States.

American politicians dismiss the Scandinavian model as creeping socialism, communism lite, something that would never work in the United States. In truth, social democracies are successful precisely because they foment dynamic capitalist economies that just happen to benefit every tier of society. That social democracy will never take hold in the United States may well be true, but, if so, it is a stunning indictment, and just what Oscar Wilde had in mind when he quipped that the United States was the only country to go from barbarism to decadence without passing through civilization.

Evidence of such terminal decadence is the choice that so many Americans made in 2016 to prioritize their personal indignations, placing their own resentments above any concerns for the fate of the country and the world, as they rushed to elect a man whose only credential for the job was his willingness to give voice to their hatreds, validate their anger, and target their enemies, real or imagined. One shudders to think of what it will mean to the world if Americans in November, knowing all that they do, elect to keep such a man in political power. But even should Trump be resoundingly defeated, it’s not at all clear that such a profoundly polarized nation will be able to find a way forward. For better or for worse, America has had its time.

The end of the American era and the passing of the torch to Asia is no occasion for celebration, no time to gloat. In a moment of international peril, when humanity might well have entered a dark age beyond all conceivable horrors, the industrial might of the United States, together with the blood of ordinary Russian soldiers, literally saved the world. American ideals, as celebrated by Madison and Monroe, Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Kennedy, at one time inspired and gave hope to millions.

If and when the Chinese are ascendant, with their concentration camps for the Uighurs, the ruthless reach of their military, their 200 million surveillance cameras watching every move and gesture of their people, we will surely long for the best years of the American century. For the moment, we have only the kleptocracy of Donald Trump. Between praising the Chinese for their treatment of the Uighurs, describing their internment and torture as “exactly the right thing to do,” and his dispensing of medical advice concerning the therapeutic use of chemical disinfectants, Trump blithely remarked, “One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.” He had in mind, of course, the coronavirus, but, as others have said, he might just as well have been referring to the American dream."
A worker earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour must work nearly 127 hours per week (more than 3 full-time jobs) to afford a two-bedroom rental home,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/28/bad-reporting-on-the-economy-is-ennobling-trump/,"While the corporate news media puts all of its focus on the Trump impeachment, it continues to advance the fiction of an economy that’s delivering for Americans and in so doing robs us of something essential; a grasp of the deteriorating circumstance for tens of millions of American households who struggle each month to make ends meet.

The December 7, 2019 edition of the New York Times encapsulated this.

With a reassuring tone, the paper of record ran a headline above the fold proclaiming “U.S. Job Growth Stays on Streak, Soothing Jitters.”

“America’s job engine has again denied jittery stock traders, bearish forecasters and blue-ribbon economists to deliver eye catching gains and power an exceptionally resilient economy,” the Times reported.

Inside the paper it described how the President “parries impeachment with a booming economy” and “tests the idea that steady paychecks are enough for voters.”

This faux sense of brimming prosperity not only provides Trump with his re-election platform. It also gives him the political capital to target poor Americans for food stamp cuts, since clearly it must be some defect in them that prevents them from being part of the Trump economic miracle.

What the corporate news media’s economic reporting tracks is how easy a time money has making more money. It is by no means a measure of national well-being and in fact, since it is entirely fixated on wealth accumulation, it ignores the toll it takes on the environment or on society as a whole.

Tracking the stock market doesn’t offer insights either into how well Americans are doing as they sink deeper into debt, defer having children and reconcile to renting.

For a real sense of the misery out there, you have to surf the regional headlines like the ones earlier this month about the fire in Alpine Motel Apartments, a rundown Las Vegas apartment building that left six dead and 13 injured.

According to published reports, tenants had resorted to using their stoves for heat and the building had been cited for more than 70 fire code violations.

This circumstance is not some one-off, but emblematic of another ignored full blown national crisis, like the health care meltdown chronicled in this space last week.

Consider that more than 30 million housing units in the U.S. “have significant physical or health hazards, such as dilapidated structures, poor heating, damaged plumbing, gas leaks, or lead,” according to the Center for American Progress. “Some estimates suggest that the direct and indirect health care costs associated with housing-related illness or injuries are in the billions of dollars. The condition of housing is even more important for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities who need housing structures that support their particular needs.”

Meanwhile, the cost of taking your chances in a location like the Alpine Place Motel continues to go up, as the scarcity of affordable housing squeezes the families the most who can least afford it.

“As a result, 23 million people in 10.7 million low income American households pay more than half their income for rent, often forgoing necessities, like food or medicine, to keep a roof over their heads,” according to the Center for Budget Priorities. “The federal government considers housing unaffordable if it costs more than 30 percent of a household’s income.”

The reality is that there’s no place in the U.S. where a person making $7.25 an hour – the federal minimum wage — can afford a place to live.

“A worker earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour must work nearly 127 hours per week (more than 3 full-time jobs) to afford a two-bedroom rental home or 103 hours per week (more than 2.5 full-time jobs) to afford a one-bedroom rental home,” according to a recent report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

The conveyor belt of American capitalism is broken. It was supposed to advance the fortunes of successive generations of Americans.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the economic circumstance of millennials whose vote will be decisive in 2020.

“They are shaken by the generational inequality of opportunity and wealth, which greases their uncertainty and incomprehension of this economy,” Rich Benjamin wrote for The Economic Hardship Reporting Project.

He continues: “It’s as though boomers, who enjoyed a traditional means of wealth accrual — debt-free education, homeownership, pensions — have removed the rungs of the ladder for those who come behind, all the while tut-tutting about the supposed irresponsibility and fragility of millennials.”

For generations the Federal Reserve has been charting our economic course based on the twinkling stars of the national unemployment rate and the Gross National Product. Yet, these aggregate abstractions are useless to navigate our 21st century dystopian reality of increasing wealth disparity and diminished social mobility."

Trump Removes Pollution Controls on Streams and Wetlands,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/climate/trump-environment-water.html?emc=rss&partner=rss,"“I terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last administration’s disastrous Waters of the United States rule,” he told the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual convention in Texas on Sunday, to rousing applause.

“That was a rule that basically took your property away from you,” added Mr. Trump, whose real estate holdings include more than a dozen golf courses. (Golf course developers were among the key opponents of the Obama rule and key backers of the new one.)

His administration had completed the first step of its demise in September with the rule’s repeal.

Mr. Trump’s replacement, called the “Navigable Waters Protection Rule,” finishes the process. It not only rolls back key portions of the 2015 rule that had guaranteed protections under the 1972 Clean Water Act to certain wetlands and streams that run intermittently or run temporarily underground, but also relieves landowners of the need to seek permits that the Environmental Protection Agency had considered on a case-by-case basis before the Obama rule.

It also gives President Trump a major policy achievement to bring to his political base while his impeachment trial continues.

“Farmers coalesced against the E.P.A. being able to come onto their land, and he’s delivering,” said Jessica Flanagain, a Republican strategist in Lincoln, Neb. “This is bigger news for agricultural producers than whatever is happening with the sideshow in D.C.,” she added."
Ships owned by cruise giant - Carnival Corporation - emit 10 times more air pollution than all of Europe’s cars,https://ecohustler.com/article/one-corporation-to-pollute-them-all/,"In April, Ecohustler disrupted Carnival Cruise's AGM calling on the shareholders to reduce their company's pollution using straight forward and affordable methods - like burning cleaner fuel. Since then, a new report outlines the corporation's impact on the coastline of Europe. These vast floating cities are burning dirty bunker fuel and creating shocking levels of air pollution wherever they go. Shipping has been an unregulated industry for too long and action is urgently required.

Carnival Corporation, the world’s largest luxury cruise operator, emitted nearly 10 times more sulphur oxide (SOx) around European coasts than did all 260 million European cars in 2017, a new analysis by sustainable transport group Transport & Environment reveals.

Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world’s second largest, is second, yet four times worse than the European car fleet. SOx emissions form sulphate (SO4) aerosols that increase human health risks and contribute to acidification in terrestrial and aquatic environments.

In absolute terms, Spain, Italy and Greece, closely followed by France and Norway, are the European countries most exposed to SOx air pollution from cruise vessels while Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca and Venice are the most impacted European port cities, followed by Civitavecchia (Rome) and Southampton.

These countries are so exposed because they are major tourist destinations, but also because they have less stringent marine sulphur fuel standards which allows cruise ships to burn the dirtiest most sulphurous fuel all along their coastlines.

Faig Abbasov, shipping policy manager at T&E, said: “Luxury cruise ships are floating cities powered by some of the dirtiest fuel possible. Cities are rightly banning dirty diesel cars but they’re giving a free pass to cruise companies that spew out toxic fumes that do immeasurable harm both to those on board and on nearby shores. This is unacceptable.“

NOX emissions from cruise ships in Europe also heavily impact some cities, equivalent to about 15% of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by Europe’s passenger car fleet in a year, the report finds. In Marseille, for example, 57 cruise ships emitted in 2017 almost as much NOx as one-quarter of the city’s 340,000 passenger cars. Along the coasts of countries such as Norway, Denmark, Greece, Croatia and Malta a handful of cruise ships are also responsible for more NOx than the majority of their domestic car fleet.

Europe should implement a zero-emission port standard as soon as possible, this could then be extended to other ship types. The report also recommends extending emission control areas (ECAs), currently in place only in the North and Baltic Seas and English Channel, to the rest of the European seas. Furthermore, the report recommends regulating NOx emissions from existing ships, which are currently exempt from NOx standards applying in emission control areas.

Faig Abbasov concluded “There are enough mature technologies to clean up cruise ships. Shore-side electricity can help cut in-port emissions, batteries are a solution for shorter distances and hydrogen technology can power even the biggest cruise ships. The cruise sector are apparently not willing to make the shift voluntarily, so we need governments to step in and mandate zero emission standards.”"
"Signs: In the first 3 months of 2020, 2,909 Americans have renounced their citizenship. 2,072 in ALL of 2019. Stats are showing a 1,015% increase in expatriation.",https://www.newswire.com/news/americans-giving-up-citizenship-faster-than-ever-before-reports-21142429,"Americans are renouncing their citizenship at the highest levels on record, according to research by the Enrolled Agents and accountants Bambridge Accountants New York.

· 2,909 Americans gave up their citizenship in the first 3 months of 2020

· Showing a 1,015% increase on the prior 3 months to December 2019 where only 261 cases were recorded

· 2,072 Americans gave up their citizenship in 2019 in total

· This is the highest quarter on record, the previous record was 2,365 cases for the fourth quarter of 2016

· It seems that the pandemic has motivated U.S. expats to cut ties and avoid the onerous tax reporting

Americans must pay a $2,350 government fee to renounce their citizenship, and those based overseas must do so in person at the U.S. Embassy in their country.

There are an estimated 9 million U.S. expats. The trend has been that there has been a steep decline over the last few years for U.S. citizens expatriating - the first 3 months of 2020 is a huge increase in the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship.

Under the IRS rules (section 6039g), every three months the U.S. Government publishes the names of all Americans who give up their citizenship. The first 3 months for 2020 had 2,909 Americans renouncing their citizenship, far more than the total of the four quarters for 2019 (2,072 Americans renounced).

Alistair Bambridge, partner at Bambridge Accountants New York, explains: “There has been a huge turnaround of U.S. expats renouncing, where the figures have been in steep decline since 2017.

“The surge in U.S. expats renouncing from our experience is that the current pandemic has allowed individuals to get their affairs in order and deal with an issue they may have been putting off for a while.

“For U.S. citizens living abroad, they are still required to file U.S. tax returns, potentially pay U.S. tax and report all their foreign bank accounts, investments and pensions held outside the U.S. For many Americans this intrusion is too much and they make the serious step of renouncing their citizenship as they do not plan to return to live in the U.S.

“There has been a silver lining for U.S. expats that they have been able to claim the Economic Impact Payment of $1,200, but for some this is too little, too late.

Huge lines in gun stores across America as country panic-buys weapons,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-us-panic-buying-guns-ammo-nra-a9403886.html?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1584362135,"As the US scrambles to deal with the spread of coronavirus, panic buying is spreading across the country.

But alongside hand sanitiser and toilet roll, many Americans have decided that – since you can’t be too careful – it’s time to snap up a gun.

Long lines are forming outside gun stores from California to Alabama to New York State, and it’s not just already well-armed gun enthusiasts joining in the rush. One seller in Mesa, AZ told a local TV station that he was seeing an uptick in first-time buyers, as did a store manager in Vallejo, CA.

Reporting from outside a gun store in Cobb County, Georgia, Fox 5’s Patty Pan reported that the owner of a store there had lived through “everything from Ebola to the bird flu” but had “never seen anything like this”, with lines as much as 12 people deep at the gun counter “non-stop for weeks now”.

Ammunition too is flying off the shelves. Online seller Ammo.com has released figures showing a huge surge in sales in the 11 days leading up to 4 March. The top ammunition-buying states were North Carolina and Georgia.

Another online retailer, Widener’s Reloading and Shooting Supply, told the National Rifle Association that by late February, both sales and online traffic had practically doubled since the same time last year.

Some of the surge in sales can be chalked up to a general feeling of paranoia; as one seller said, “Any time people are uneasy, sales go up, and it’s always the same, guns and ammo”. But other Americans are arming themselves for more specific reasons.

One gun shop owner in Arcadia, CA told a local CBS station that his store had seen ten times the usual number of customers – many of them Asian Americans worried that in the event of rising social disorder, they may be targeted because of their ethnicity. Reports of racism directed at Asian Americans have surfaced across the US.

Panic buying in general is taking hold to such an extent that Donald Trump has now told people to stop.

“Relax. You’re doing great,” he said, citing conversations with CEOs of major companies. “There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies, they said to me. Have a nice dinner, relax, because there’s plenty. You don’t have to buy the quantities, because it’s hard to refill.”

Whether or not Mr Trump would extend that reassurance to cover firearms is unknown, but as gun sales have surged, his outspoken son has weighed in. Pouncing on what he saw as the hypocrisy of gun control advocates, Donald Trump Jr tweeted that many of his “lefty friends” have called him this week with a sudden interest in guns.

He was moved to tweet by an emergency ordinance passed in the central Illinois city of Champaign that grants the mayor sweeping emergency powers, a policy that some on the right – including the National Rifle Association – interpreted as the first step toward a local ban on weapons sales."
"Humans will not 'migrate' to other planets, Nobel winner says: The 77-year-old said he felt the need to ""kill all the statements that say 'OK, we will go to a liveable planet if one day life is not possible on earth'.""",https://phys.org/news/2019-10-humans-migrate-planets-nobel-winner.html,"Nobel prize winner Michel Mayor says he idea of humans living on a nother planet is 'completely crazy'

Humans will never migrate to a planet outside of Earth's solar system because it would take far too long to get there, Swiss Nobel laureate Michel Mayor said Wednesday.

Mayor and his colleague Didier Queloz were on Tuesday awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for their research refining techniques to detect so-called exoplanets.

""If we are talking about exoplanets, things should be clear: we will not migrate there,"" Mayor told AFP near Madrid on the sidelines of a conference when asked about the possibility of humans moving to other planets.

""These planets are much, much too far away. Even in the very optimistic case of a livable planet that is not too far, say a few dozen light years, which is not a lot, it's in the neighbourhood, the time to go there is considerable,"" he added.

""We are talking about hundreds of millions of days using the means we have available today. We must take care of our planet, it is very beautiful and still absolutely liveable.""

The 77-year-old said he felt the need to ""kill all the statements that say 'OK, we will go to a liveable planet if one day life is not possible on earth'.""

""It's completely crazy,"" he added.

Using custom-made instruments at their observatory in southern France, Mayor and Queloz in October 1995 discovered what had previously only existed in the realm of science fiction—a planet outside Earth's solar system.

Mayor was a professor at Geneva University and Queloz was his doctorate student, when they made the discovery which started a revolution in astronomy. Since then over 4,000 exoplanets have been found in our home galaxy.

""It was a very old question which was debated by philosophers: are there other worlds in the Universe?,"" Mayor said.

""We look for planets which are the closest (to us), which could resemble Earth. Together with my colleague we started this search for planets, we showed it was possible to study them.""

Mayor said it was up to the ""next generation"" to answer the question of whether there is life on other planets.

""We don't know! The only way to do it is to develop techniques that would allow us to detect life at a distance,"" he said.

"Japan’s middle class is ‘disappearing’ as poverty rises, warns economist",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/03/japans-middle-class-is-disappearing-as-poverty-rises-warns-economist.html,"A man wearing a facemask walks past a taxi along a street in Shinjuku district of Tokyo on June 24, 2020. PHILIP FONG | AFP via Getty Images

As poverty rises in Japan, the country's middle class is slowly eroding away, according to a recent report by Oxford Economics' Shigeto Nagai. ""After the bubble burst in the 1990s, income has declined across the income percentiles, and the share of low-income households has risen as those of middle- and high-income groups shrink,"" Nagai, who is head of Japan economics at the firm, wrote in the report. The ten years starting from the early 1990s have often been referred to as Japan's ""Lost Decade."" The period was marked by economic stagnation and deflation following a boom in the prior years. ""Although it's true that inequality hasn't widened and income isn't concentrated in the top tiers, the share of low-income households has been rising at the expense of middle-income groups in a process of secular income decline across percentiles,"" the economist said. Japan's poverty rate stands at 15.7%, according to the latest figures from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. That metric refers to people whose household income is less than half of the median of the entire population. ""The middle class is disappearing in Japan, albeit gradually,"" Nagai warned.

Japan's 'life-time employment system'

A ""major driving force"" determining the income distribution has been its ""life-time employment system,"" Nagai told CNBC. It has been around for decades and was established during the country's high growth period in the 1950s and 60s, he said, when there was a ""very serious shortage of labor."" The system is mainly practiced by relatively established companies and has three pillars, according to the economist: The ""implicit guarantee"" to take care of employees until retirement Wages that are dictated by seniority Company-based labor unions In this relatively stable but rigid employment system, wages rise only gradually. Companies also place heavier emphasis on job security rather than compensating for short-term improvement in company performance or productivity, Nagai said.

The economist told CNBC that wage increments are decided by an annual spring negotiation known as Shunto, where the wages of unionized workers are decided by labor unions and management. What distinguishes this process from elsewhere is that the base-pay increase usually spreads across the entire seniority-based wage scale. As a result, Nagai said, the system does not create a ""top 1% earner"" unlike Western compensation systems where top executives typically earn much more than other employees. In fact, the economist said that executive pay is ""negligible"" compared with places such as the U.S. He said, however, the elite in Japan have been ""satisfied"" with this flatter salary scale.

Rising part-time employment

For years, Japanese companies have also been converting regular workers — who could previously enjoy the comparatively privileged lifetime-employment system — to part-time workers. This shift, according to Nagai, started in the early 2000s as companies attempted to ""survive"" the competition with rising emerging-market economies such as China, where labor costs are lower. More recently, the increase in part-time workers may also be coming from greater labor-market participation among two demographics, Nagai suggested: women who need work, but may not be able to commit full-time due to childcare duties and seniors who are no longer able to enjoy retirement as their pension benefits are not large enough. According to data from Japan's statistics bureau, the number of non-regular employees rose 2.1% annually in 2019. That was far faster than 0.5% growth in regular employees. ""Although hourly wages have been rising faster for non-regular workers amid a shortage of

labour, they're still paid much less compared to regular workers,"" Nagai said. ""In addition, the entry of women and the elderly into the labour market as part-timers has depressed hours per worker for several years."" ""The share of low-income households will keep rising as more part-timers work fewer hours,"" he said.

Low inflation expectations

Meanwhile, lower inflation expectations have ""really stabilized"" in the country, Nagai said, arguing this has also contributed to the stagnation of wage increases. For years, the Bank of Japan has struggled to meet its ever-elusive 2% inflation target despite taking drastic measures such as bringing interest rates into negative territory. The main beneficiaries of low interest-rate policies and aggressive quantitative easing are usually those who own real estate or stocks, Nagai said. The impact has been ""relatively limited"" due to the risk-averse nature of Japanese households, which generally do not invest in stocks and corporate bonds. He said this could be another reason why monetary policy has had limited impact on income distribution.

Sluggish consumption

The economist said he was concerned that the disappearance of Japan's middle class could lead to further stagnation in consumption. Consumer spending slumped after a sales tax hike in October. It fell even further this year as lockdown measures intended to contain the coronavirus pandemic froze economies. Recent data from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed May retail sales dropped 12.3% from last year. Nagai said the ""jury is still out"" over the government's consumption tax hike due to the unexpected impact of Covid-19. While the move had ""certain justifications,"" the economist acknowledged lower income groups are more sensitive to tax hikes.

The way out

A more dynamic human resource allocation could help lead Japan out of this situation, Nagai said. The lifetime employment system has led to many people being underemployed, he said. At the same time, numerous young people are left ""reluctantly"" living with relatively low pay, despite higher contribution and productivity. The ""static"" allocation of human resources has hampered efforts to get rid of the ""deflationary equilibrium"" in Japan, he said. While more graduates are now choosing start-ups instead of established companies, Nagai said it is still ""not a major trend yet."" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has tried to combat many of these issues, attempting to make the labor market more performance-based, Nagai said. But corporations and their management have been reluctant to change, impeding government efforts, he said."

First active leak of sea-bed methane discovered in Antarctica,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/22/first-active-leak-of-sea-bed-methane-discovered-in-antarctica,"The first active leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica has been revealed by scientists.

The researchers also found microbes that normally consume the potent greenhouse gas before it reaches the atmosphere had only arrived in small numbers after five years, allowing the gas to escape.

Vast quantities of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica. The gas could start to leak as the climate crisis warms the oceans, a prospect the researchers said was “incredibly concerning”.

The reason for the emergence of the new seep remains a mystery, but it is probably not global heating, as the Ross Sea where it was found has yet to warm significantly. The research also has significance for climate models, which currently do not account for a delay in the microbial consumption of escaping methane.

The active seep was first spotted by chance by divers in 2011, but it took scientists until 2016 to return to the site and study it in detail, before beginning laboratory work.

“The delay [in methane consumption] is the most important finding,” said Andrew Thurber, from Oregon State University in the US, who led the research. “It is not good news. It took more than five years for the microbes to begin to show up and even then there was still methane rapidly escaping from the sea floor.”

The release of methane from frozen underwater stores or permafrost regions is one of the key tipping points that scientists are concerned about, which occur when a particular impact of global heating becomes unstoppable.

Scientists shocked by Arctic permafrost thawing 70 years sooner than predicted Read more

“The methane cycle is absolutely something that we as a society need to be concerned about,” said Thurber. “I find it incredibly concerning.”

Very little was known about the Antarctic methane cycle but the good news, he said, was that the new seep provided a natural laboratory for further research.

Why the new seep formed is unknown. “That is a mystery that we still do not have an answer to,” Thurber said. “It is on the side of an active volcano but it doesn’t seem like it came from that.”

Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved in the study, said: “Antarctica and its ice sheet are huge black holes in our understanding of Earth’s methane cycle – they are difficult places to work.

“We think that there is likely [to be] significant methane beneath the ice sheet,” she said. “The big question is: how large is the lag [in methane-consuming microbes] compared with the speed at which new leaks of methane might potentially form in the wake of retreating ice?”

The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, reports the discovery of the methane seep at a 10-metre (30ft) deep site known as Cinder Cones in McMurdo Sound. It is a 70-metre long patch of white microbial mats, and a second seep was found during the 2016 expedition.

“We stumbled upon the methane seep at a site that has been dived at since the 1960s and it had just turned on,” said Thurber. There were no bubbles of methane, he said. “Most of the methane in many seeps actually comes out in what we call diffuse flows. So it’s just dissolved in the water.”

The source of the methane is probably decaying algae deposits buried under sediments and is likely to be thousands of years old. In most parts of the oceans, methane leaking from the sea bed is consumed by microbes in the sediment or the water column above. But the slow growth of microbes at the Cinder Cones site, and its shallow depth, means methane is almost certain to be leaking into the atmosphere.

Thurber said the first microbes to grow at the site were of an unexpected strain. “We’re probably in a successional stage, where it may be five to 10 years before a community becomes fully adapted and starts consuming methane.”

Widespread active methane seepage was reported off the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia in 2014, a first for the Southern Ocean. “But that’s really a different oceanographic area than the Antarctic continent,” Thurber said.

Wadham said the five years for which the Cinder Cones seep has been studied is a short amount of time. “So it would be good to see what happens to this seep into the future. The discovery also makes you wonder if these features are more common than we might think around Antarctica, but are rarely stumbled upon.”

However, the researchers are unlikely to be able to return to Antarctica soon. The continent is currently free of coronavirus but the risk of infection has disrupted expedition plans."
"Iraq is rioting too: internet shut down, over 260 protesters killed by government forces since October",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-protests/iraqi-forces-shoot-at-protesters-killing-four-in-baghdad-idUSKBN1XH0JG,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces shot dead at least six anti-government protesters in Baghdad on Thursday and killed four others as they broke up a sit-in in the southern city of Basra, police and medical sources said.

Scores more were wounded in the clashes as weeks of deadly violence in Iraq over protests against an entrenched political elite showed no signs of abating.

Security forces used live fire against protesters near Shuhada Bridge in central Baghdad. Gunfire was used against demonstrators in Basra, the main source of Iraq’s oil wealth, who had staged a days-long sit-in.

Elsewhere in southern Iraq, dozens of protesters burned tires and blocked the entrance to the port of Umm Qasr, preventing lorries from transporting food imports, just hours after operations had resumed, port officials said.

The Iraqi government has failed to find a way out of the biggest and most complicated challenge it has faced in years. The unrest has shattered the relative calm that followed the defeat of Islamic State in 2017.

A crackdown by authorities against mostly unarmed protesters has killed more than 260 people since demonstrations began on Oct. 1 over lack of jobs, chronic power and clean water shortages, poor education and healthcare and corruption.

Protesters, mostly unemployed youths, blame a political elite that has ruled Iraq since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, and demand a complete overhaul of the political system.

The economy is beginning to feel the pinch.

Internet outages imposed by the government to try to stem unrest have hit the private sector, a central bank source said.

The source said private banks in Iraq had recorded losses of some $16 million per day since the internet was first shut down at the beginning of October.

Combined losses by the private banks and mobile phone companies, money transfer services, tourism and airline booking offices had averaged more than $40 million per day, the source said - almost $1.5 billion for Iraq in just over a month.

Umm Qasr briefly resumed operations early on Thursday after most protesters cleared the area. But several dozen activists, relatives of a demonstrator killed during weeks of violence, then returned to block the main gate, port officials said.

Umm Qasr receives most of the grain, vegetable oils and sugar that Iraq depends upon.

Oil and security officials said operations resumed on Thursday at the nearby Nassiriya oil refinery, where protesters had stopped fuel tankers entering or leaving the day before.

Oil production and exports have not been significantly affected by the unrest, oil ministry officials say.

But the halting of fuel tankers that transport fuel from the Nassiriya refinery to regional gas stations caused fuel shortages across the southern Iraqi province of Dhi Qar. The refinery had recently been producing around half its capacity, oil officials said.

The internet returned briefly in most parts of Iraq on Thursday but went out again after 1:00 p.m. local time (1000 GMT).

The government says it is enacting reforms but has offered nothing that is likely to satisfy most protesters.

Stipends for the poor, more job opportunities for graduates and pledges to punish a handful of corrupt officials have come too late for those demanding an overhaul of state institutions, a flawed electoral process and system of governance that has fueled endemic corruption, many Iraqis say."
"Oxfam Report Contains Dire Warning for Global Capitalism. ""Extreme wealth is a sign of a failing economic system.""",https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/23/oxfam-report-contains-dire-warning-global-capitalism,"“I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason we’re in trouble,” former Vice President Joe Biden told an audience at the Brookings Institute in 2018. It was a few months before he’d officially declare his candidacy for president, but Biden’s position was clear: “The folks at the top aren’t bad guys.”

After Bernie Sanders said that “Billionaires should not exist” during a 2019 New York Times interview, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, himself worth approximately $80 billion, took pains to defend the supposed goodness of the ultra-wealthy, including in a live-streamed employee Q&A at Facebook and on Fox Business News.

Amid the evergreen insistence that the world’s richest deserve to stay that way, and just as the World Economic Forum—the annual gathering of political and economic elites—gets underway in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam, the global charity, has released its annual report on global wealth inequality. Its title could double as a demand to the likes of Biden and Zuckerberg: “Time to Care.”

""Extreme wealth,” the authors say, “is a sign of a failing economic system.”

Using data from Credit Suisse Research Institute’s “Global Wealth Databook (2019)” and the 2019 Forbes billionaire list, Oxfam found that just 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people combined. The report also focuses on how sexism and other forms of discrimination exacerbate inequality. For example, the 22 richest men in the world have more wealth than all the women in Africa.

The authors also calculate that women and girls perform 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work, including caring for their families, “a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year, more than three times the size of the global tech industry.”

As Oxfam India CEO Amitabh Behar said in a statement ahead of the report’s release, “Our broken economies are lining the pockets of billionaires and big business at the expense of ordinary men and women. No wonder people are starting to question whether billionaires should even exist.”

Behar will represent Oxfam this week at the World Economic Forum, whose guest list is wide enough to encompass both environmental activist Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump. It’s the kind of place where attendees theoretically discuss the world’s greatest economic problems, but in practice, they often come by private jet to make deals that only enhance their exorbitant wealth.

As Dutch journalist and historian Rutger Bregman said, regarding a 2019 panel discussion he moderated at Davos, “I hear people talk in the language of participation and justice and equality and transparency, but then … almost no one raises the real issue of tax avoidance, right? And of the rich just not paying their fair share. I mean, it feels like I’m at a firefighters conference and no one is allowed to speak about water.”

Behar’s job will be to speak about the metaphorical water, to demand that attendees talk openly about inequality, and to advocate for Oxfam’s recommendation that governments worldwide raise taxes on the richest 1% of their citizens by 0.5% over the next decade. According to the report, it would be enough to create 117 million jobs, in fields such as education and health care.

The authors make additional recommendations, including investing in a national care system with set wages for caregivers of all kinds, plus health care and paid time off, all of which would require extensive government support and intervention. Oxfam believes that’s the only way to make change: “The gap between rich and poor can’t be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies,” Behar says, “and too few governments are committed to these.”

Trump has rolled back 98 environmental rules so far,https://electrek.co/2020/05/09/climate-crisis-weekly-trump-rolled-back-98-environmental-rules-new-york-times-montana/,"The New York Times compiled a list of all the environmental policies Trump has killed.

The League of Conservation Voters board chair on why the 2020 US election is vital for Earth.

Montana fossil-fuel leases are set aside by a federal judge because the BLM did no environmental analysis.

And more…

Donald Trump promised to deregulate environmental and climate policies, and he’s delivered. Why did he want to do that? Because he thinks the rules are unnecessary, that industry can regulate itself, and he continues to actively try to save the fossil-fuel industry. (It’s not working.)

The New York Times drew data from eight sources to calculate all of Trump’s rollbacks, and here’s what they found:

Using the Congressional Review Act, 64 rules have been reversed, and 34 are in progress. So that’s 98 in total. And the majority of rollbacks have been carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency. (Oh, the irony.) And meanwhile, the Interior Department is working to open up more land for oil and gas drilling.

But these rollbacks haven’t occurred without a fight. For example, the Natural Resources Defense Council has taken the EPA to court 65 times and won 60 of its cases. The group has filed 107 lawsuits against the US government’s rollbacks.

Visit the New York Times‘ website (link is above) to see the full list of what’s been rolled back. Here are the numbers by category:

Air pollution and emissions: 27

27 Drilling and extraction: 19

19 Infrastructure and planning: 11

11 Animals: 11

11 Toxic substances and safety: 8

8 Water pollution: 11

11 Other: 11

Brookings also has a great deregulation tracker tool that you can access here for free.

Electrek frequently writes about the rollbacks — and we also write about the rollbacks being overturned by the judicial system. On April 7, for example, a federal court struck down the EPA’s rollback of the greenhouse-gas-leak prevention rule. The court said that the Trump administration did not follow proper procedure.

And on April 23, the Supreme Court upheld the Clean Water Act in Maui.

If we could perhaps be able to write about reinstated or newly implemented environmental protections in 2021, that’d be great, thanks.

Following from above, Carol M. Browner (left), the board chair of the League of Conservation Voters and former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, wrote an op-ed for the Hill on Wednesday about how crucial it is to have an environmental champion in the White House in 2020. You can read it in full by clicking on the link, but here’s an excerpt. (And Ms. Browner, we couldn’t agree more. It’s not about partisanship: It’s about saving our planet. Life or death.)

The COVID-19 crisis has exposed a number of vital truths about the preparedness of our country to deal with such disasters and the absolute imperative that we elect leaders who will listen to experts and scientists and act accordingly. Climate-related natural disasters have already cost thousands of lives and more than $450 billion in the past three years and could cost $54 trillion worldwide by 2040. The US economy could shrink by as much as 10% or upward of $500 billion a year in crop damage, lost labor, and extreme weather damages. This is almost double the economic blow of the Great Recession of 2009. The list of costs due to inaction on climate is long. The choice we make this November will define the world our children will inherit. The 2020 elections are our last, best chance to elect leaders at all levels of government who will advance racially just and equitable solutions to the climate crisis. The stakes have never been higher.

Here’s a current example of a Trump administration fossil-fuel push gone wrong. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was told by a federal judge last Friday that it failed to adequately assess environmental impacts of oil and gas leases in Montana. Judge Brian Morris then set aside hundreds of those leases in eastern Montana.

Morris said that the BLM must conduct a more complete analysis of environmental impacts before sales move forward.

The BLM failed to consider the potential impacts the oil and gas leases would have on Montana’s groundwater.

Morris stated that BLM failed to address environmental group WildEarth’s lawsuit adequately, in a rather amusing way:

A weatherman proves unhelpful if he says ‘it’s going to be windy tomorrow’ when asked if it will rain. BLM proves just as unresponsive here. Our erstwhile weatherman proves similarly unhelpful when he says ‘it’s going to rain’ after someone asks how much it will rain tomorrow. The large-scale nature of environmental issues like climate change show why cumulative impacts analysis proves vital to the overall [National Environmental Policy Act] NEPA analysis. The Court does not fault BLM for providing a faulty analysis of cumulative impacts or impacts to groundwater, it largely faults BLM for failing to provide any analysis.

Phoenix hits 50th day of 110 degrees; previous record 'obliterated' (Previous was 33 days in 2011),https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2020/08/28/phoenix-hits-50th-day-110-degrees-2020/5662386002/?fbclid=IwAR1_In1w6dQ7jp2mO1EieT_XktR4TH29_ABHaP1AmG1n9Qew6_XjZ1HKQFk,"Phoenix hits 50th day of 110 degrees; previous record 'obliterated'

Friday marked the 50th day to reach 110 degrees or higher in the Valley this year, setting a record nobody wanted.

Before 2020, the previous record for most days in a calendar year to reach 110 degrees was 33 days set in 2011. Phoenix surpassed that on Aug. 9 and has beat it almost every day since then.

Phoenix passed the scorching milestone on Friday afternoon when the temperature at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport hit 111 degrees.

""It's not like we barely broke this record,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Matthew Hirsch. ""We sort of obliterated it.""

The heat, Hirsch explained, is largely a result of persistent high pressure this summer. High pressure normally produces warmer than average temperatures. Those conditions were exacerbated by an uncharacteristically dry summer. Phoenix experienced less than 4 inches of rainfall since the beginning of the year.

For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.

""When you don't have moisture to cool it down, excessive heat can persist,"" Hirsch said. ""Essentially, we didn't get any relief from monsoon storms.""

Forecasters expect some of that relief this weekend, with a good chance of thunderstorms and heavy rain from Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning. A flash flood watch was issued for central Arizona, to begin at noon on Saturday.

FATAL HEAT: Rising temperatures day and night kill more people each year

With the rain comes cooler temperatures. The Valley may finally see a sub-100 degree high temperature on Sunday.

Average temperatures have been rising with human-caused climate change, and this summer has brought record heat in places across the Southwest.

In the Phoenix area, the urban heat-island effect contributes to hotter temperatures. The vast areas of concrete and asphalt soak up heat from the sun during the day and radiate it at night, pushing temperatures higher than in other undeveloped areas.

National Weather Service data for Phoenix shows that during the summer months from June through August, the average temperature during the 2010s was 3.1 degrees hotter than during the 1970s.

"Jobless claims: Another 898,000 Americans filed new unemployment claims last week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobless-claims-coronavirus-unemployment-week-ended-october-10-2020-183353138.html,"U.S. states saw another 898,000 Americans file first-time unemployment insurance claims last week, representing an unexpected rise in new claims with the pandemic still under way and another round of fiscal stimulus still out of reach.

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to Bloomberg estimates:

Initial jobless claims, week ended Oct. 10: 898,000 vs. 825,000 expected and 845,000 during the prior week

Continuing jobless claims, week ended Oct. 3: 10.018 million vs. 10.550 million expected and 11.183 million during the prior week

Jobless claims rose by 53,000 last week, after back-to-back weeks of improvements in new jobless claims.

At 898,000, the sum represented the seventh straight week that initial claims came in below the 1 million mark. However, new claims have held stubbornly above 800,000 for as many weeks, with a steady stream of new layoffs continuing to weigh on the economic recovery.

Continuing claims, however, trended lower. These claims, which are reported on a one-week lag and capture the total number of individuals still receiving unemployment benefits, fell by a greater than expected 1.17 million from the previous week’s upwardly revised level.

But other data underscored the ongoing strain on the labor market: unadjusted claims for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation jumped by more than 818,000 to 2.78 million for the week ended September 26, marking a surge in those who had exhausted state aid and moved to claim the federal program’s additional 13 weeks of benefits.

The jump in headline new jobless claims came even as California, the most populous state, continued with a pause in reporting new unadjusted claims to the national total, and again reported claims at its mid-September level. The state said earlier this month that it was temporarily halting processing initial claims to “reduce its claims processing backlog and implement fraud prevention technology,” according to a Labor Department’s statement.

Story continues

Jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)

At the national level, new jobless claims remain higher than their peak during the Great Recession, albeit well off their pandemic-era apex of nearly 7 million. And newly announced job cuts continue to roll in: Companies including AT&T’s Warner Media were reportedly planning thousands of job cuts, according to a Wall Street Journal report last week, and theater-operator Cineworld recently announced it was temporarily closing all its U.S. locations, in a move that would affect some 40,000 workers.

In Washington, a deal on further fiscal stimulus to help keep workers on payrolls and support unemployed Americans with augmented benefits remains elusive. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he planned to have the Senate take up relief legislation after the chamber’s return next week, with his narrower proposal set to include funds chiefly targeted to the Paycheck Protection Program. The deal is virtually certain to be rejected by the House, however, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi having previously rejected slimmed-down stimulus proposals and deemed them inadequate.

DOJ Designates New York City as an “Anarchist Jurisdiction”,https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/doj-designates-new-york-city-as-an-anarchist-jurisdiction/2627588/,"What to Know The Justice Department designated NYC, Portland and Seattle as ""anarchist jurisdictions"" under guidelines issued by President Trump earlier this month

Trump's Sept. 2 memo directs federal agencies to minimize funding for designated cities

Federal grants account for billions of dollars of NYC's annual budget, and the city has threatened to sue over any move to defund it

New York City is one of three places that ""have permitted violence and destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures to counteract criminal activities,"" leading to its designation as an ""anarchist jurisdiction,"" the Justice Department said Monday.

Rather than idle words, the designation has potential financial consequences. President Trump issued a memo earlier this month directing the DOJ to identify jurisdictions that, in its view, were not enforcing the law appropriately. Designated cities could lose their federal funding.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo minced no words in responding to the DOJ assessment.

“I understand the politics, but when you try to manipulate and distort government agencies to play politics, which is what the Trump administration has done from day one … this is more of the same,"" Cuomo said on a conference call with reporters. “The president can’t supersede the law and say I’m going to make those funds basically discretionary funds, which is what he would have to do.”

“If they actually do this, we will challenge it legally, and they will lose once again,"" he added.

Trump's Sept. 2 order gives the director of the Office of Management and Budget 30 days to issue guidance to federal agencies on restricting eligibility for federal grants for the cities on the DOJ list. Such grants make up a huge portion of NYC's already strapped annual budget -- more than $7 billion in fiscal 2021 alone, or 7.5% of the city's projected total revenue.

In justifying its decision, the DOJ cited New York City's rising gun violence, cuts to the NYPD's budget, and moves by various district attorneys not to prosecute charges related to protests earlier this summer. Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington were also hit with the same designation.

President Trump threatened to defund New York City and what the officials had to say, Andrew Siff reports.

“We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance. It is my hope that the cities identified by the Department of Justice today will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.

Both the city and the state have previously threatened to sue the federal government over the possible DOJ classification, which Mayor Bill de Blasio reiterated Monday. De Blasio, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued a joint statement Monday afternoon blasting Trump.

""This is thoroughly political and unconstitutional. The President is playing cheap political games with Congressionally directed funds,"" they said in a statement, blasting what they called ""recklessness and partisanship from the White House."""

Young people are dying from suicide at record rates.

The suicide rate among people aged 10 to 24 increased 56% between 2007 and 2017, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The increase in youth suicide has also sped up recently, according to the report. Between 2007 and 2013, the suicide rate for young people grew at an average of 3% per year; between 2013 to 2017, that number shot up to 7% per year.

For children aged 10 to 14, the suicide rate tripled between 2007 to 2017 after years of decline. For teens between 15 and 19, the rate increased by 76% in that same time period.

Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people aged 10 to 24 in 2017.

Why Gen Zers might be facing a mental health crisis even worse than millennials did

The new data suggests Gen Z — or the generation of Americans born during 1997 onward — might be seeing a mental health crisis even worse than that faced by the older millennial generation.

Since 2014, millennials (or people who turned 23 to 38 in 2019) have seen a 47% increase in major-depression diagnoses. ""Deaths of despair,"" or dying from suicide, alcohol, and drugs, increased in the millennial population in the last 10 years, and they are more likely to report feeling lonely than other generations.

For Gen Z, the mental illness crisis continues. In 2017, 13% of teens reported having experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, Pew Research Center reported. In 2007, when more millennials were teens, that number was just 8%.

Social media might be fueling the increase in mental illness, as Gen Z is the first truly digital generation. Pew Research Center found 45% of teens aged 13 to 17 said they use the internet ""almost constantly."" Over-use of social media can cause loneliness, depression, and anxiety, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America reported.

Gen Z teenagers told Business Insider the constant social-media use was driving a longing for interpersonal connection.

""I feel like we have too much of a reliance on technology,"" Jess Gallo, 19, said. ""And we don't really appreciate the value of books or interpersonal communication.""

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or has had thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life, there's help for you. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) provides 24/7, free, confidential support for people in distress, as well as best practices for professionals and resources to aid in prevention and crisis situations."
Poll: 51% Of Young Voters Believe Humanity Could Be Wiped Out Within 15 Years,https://www.climatedepot.com/2019/09/24/poll-51-of-young-voters-believe-humanity-could-be-wiped-out-within-15-years/,"https://scottrasmussen.com/51-of-young-voters-believe-humanity-could-be-wiped-out-within-15-years/

Over the next 10-15 years, 29% of all voters believe it is at least somewhat likely that the earth will become uninhabitable and humanity will be wiped out. A ScottRasmussen.com national survey found that 71% disagree and find it unlikely.

The totals include 10% who consider it Very Likely and 37% who say Not at All Likely.

There is a dramatic difference by age on this question. Half (51%) of voters under 35 believe it is at least somewhat likely humanity will be wiped out in the next decade or so. Only 12% of senior citizens agree (and only 4% of seniors believe it is Very Likely).

In the early days of the Cold War, many young people had similar concerns that the world would be destroyed by nuclear weapons. Another generation was convinced that overpopulation would devastate the human race by the 1980s. While we do not have comparable polling data for those periods, the response of young people today seems very similar.

The data also reveals a significant geographical divide. Forty-five percent (45%) of urban residents think humanity may be wiped out by climate change in 10-15 years. Only 23% of rural voters and 22% of suburban voters agree.

Twenty-one percent (21%) of urban voters consider it Very Likely the earth will quickly become uninhabitable. Just 6% of rural voters and 5% of suburban voters consider that a Very Likely outcome (see crosstab results).

Data released earlier showed that just 10% of voters were aware the Global Climate Strike had been scheduled for last week."
NBA season suspended indefinitely after player tested positive. Apparently we have enough tests for all the players to play a game but not enough for society to be tested when you have synptoms..,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/03/11/nba-suspends-its-season/,"Getty Images

As the NBA was considering playing the balance of its season without fans, the NBA has unexpectedly — and swiftly — taken things a step farther.

After Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday night, the NBA suspended its season.

It’s unclear when the season will continue, but it will not continue for the foreseeable future. And that will surely prompt other sports leagues to consider taking similar action, whether it’s Major League Baseball, the NHL, Major League Soccer, or the NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.

The NFL, meanwhile, has not canceled its annual meetings or altered the plans for its draft, which will be held in 43 days in Las Vegas."

For the first time ever, US billionaires pay lower tax rate than workers",https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/for-first-time-ever-us-billionaires-pay-lower-tax-rate-than-workers-20191009-p52yx4.html,"A new book-length study on the tax burden of the ultrarich begins with a startling finding: In 2018, for the first time in history, America's richest billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate than the working class.

""The Triumph of Injustice,"" by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley, presents a first-of-its kind analysis of Americans' effective tax rates since the 1960s. It finds that in 2018 the average effective tax rate paid by the richest 400 families in the country was 23 per cent, a full percentage point lower than the 24.2 per cent rate paid by the bottom half of American households.

In 1980, by contrast, the 400 richest had an effective tax rate of 47 per cent. In 1960, their tax rate was as high as 56 per cent. The effective tax rate paid by the bottom 50 per cent, by contrast, has changed little over time.

The tipping point came in 2017 with the passage of Donald Trump's tax cuts. They were a windfall for the wealthy. Credit:AP

The analysis differs from many other published estimates of tax burdens by encompassing the totality of taxes Americans pay: not just federal income taxes but also corporate taxes, as well as taxes paid at the state and local levels. It also includes the burden of about $US250 billion of what Saez and Zucman call ""indirect taxes,"" such as licenses for motor vehicles and businesses."

Researchers soon identified the bug as a “novel swine flu.” It quickly jumped to the United States and spread worldwide, and in June, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, the first time it had done so since the deadly avian flu outbreak of 1968.

The 2009 swine flu strain didn’t turn out to be as deadly as originally feared. Although indeed novel, it was similar enough to older flu strains that about a third of people over 60—the most vulnerable population—had preexisting antibodies to the virus, helping them shake it off. Even so, it killed more than 284,000 people around the world, including at least 12,469 Americans.

We might not be so lucky next time. As the COVID-19 crisis lingers with no end in sight, it’s no fun to think about other emerging contagions that could be coming our way. But given the gaping holes the coronavirus fiasco has exposed in our infectious-disease response systems, it seems prudent to squarely face what’s coming down the pike—in hopes we can prepare to do better.

The likely source of the next pandemic is all around us: It’s the same one that triggered the 2009 scare. Industrial-scale hog and chicken farming—innovated in the United States and rapidly spreading globally—provides an ideal environment for the evolution and transmission of novel pathogens, especially influenza, that can infect people. (Cattle generally aren’t susceptible to human-adapted flus.)

“Another influenza pandemic occurring at some stage of the future is exceedingly high,” said Richard Webby, professor of infectious diseases at Memphis-based St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals. “The chances that it’ll come from some sort of farmed animal—my personal opinion is, that’s high as well.”

Gregory Gray, a professor of medicine, global health, and environmental health at Duke University and an expert on animal-to-human disease transmission, is even more direct. His biggest worry for the next viral pandemic? “Influenza A viruses that originate in pigs,” he said. “Hands down.”

The 2009 flu scare inspired the US government to ramp up its effort to monitor factory-scale farms for new pathogens, Gray added. But its surveillance was limited from the start, and in recent years has dwindled.

Pigs have a special capacity to incubate new viruses. Although birds are hosts to many kinds of influenza, avian flus don’t bounce easily to humans. There have been some exceptions: The 1997 H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong sickened at least 18 people and killed six. But that event, as well as smaller outbreaks since, was relatively easy to control, because once the pathogen invaded the human immune system, it didn’t show much ability to spread person-to-person. Most infections involved people who had been in direct contact with birds.

Like DJs creating something new by grabbing and combining snippets from old vinyl records, flus use the bodies of pigs to make the viral equivalent of a mixtape.

Hogs are different. While pure swine flus don’t jump easily to humans, pigs can catch flu viruses that are from birds and humans, and then pass them back and forth. When more than one flu virus has infected a single host, the viruses have the sinister ability to swap genes, a process researchers call “reassortment.” Like DJs creating something new by grabbing and combining snippets from old vinyl records, flus use the bodies of pigs to make the viral equivalent of a mixtape. If a pig catches an avian flu and a human flu at the same time, the two viruses can morph into novel strains that contain swine, human, and avian genetic material, with the potential ability to infect all three species.

That’s why many epidemiologists call hogs “mixing vessels” for flu strains; they provide a host in which avian- and swine-evolved flus can reach people. And since human immune systems have little exposure to bird flus, it can be quite dangerous for us when genetic traces of these bird flus invade our bodies through a strain that was reassorted inside of a hog.

So scientists were alarmed earlier this summer when Chinese researchers published a paper in the peer-reviewed US journal PNAS reporting that an “avian-like” swine flu strain had become pervasive in the nation’s vast hog operations, containing “all the essential hallmarks” of a virus that can cause a human pandemic. The team tested 338 workers who routinely come into contact with hogs and found that 10.4 percent had antibodies to the new strain, meaning they had unknowingly contracted and recovered from the virus. They also tested 230 people who aren’t associated with the hog industry and found antibodies in 4.4 percent of them. In other words, the virus is out there, infecting people and evolving; likely being swapped back and forth between workers and hogs.

The strain recently identified in China, known as G4 EA H1N1, is related to the H1N1 flu that caused the global pandemic in 2009. The 2009 strain contained genes from avian, swine, and human flus—a classic “triple reassortment.” It has also taken on avian genes through reassortment that makes it novel to our immune systems—meaning it could be very hard to fight.

The new flu hasn’t caused major problems yet; it hasn’t proven either highly contagious or particularly virulent. But that could change as it circulates among the workers and animals in China’s hog industry. The fact that it’s out in the world, the paper warns, “greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses.” The WHO’s Webby put it like this: “It’s a numbers game. These viruses throw out mutations every time they replicate, so the more chances the virus gets, the more interactions with humans, the more chance that one day the stars will align in the right order, the virus will get the right mutation, and take off.”

Changes in our eating habits and farming practices have dramatically ramped up pigs’ propensity to gin up new pathogens. Humans domesticated them at least 9,000 years ago, and we’ve probably been swapping flus with them ever since. But for almost that entire history, hog farming was essentially a backyard activity, with relatively few animals per operation, and broad genetic diversity in the population. The numbers game Webby describes exists when hogs are kept on a small scale, outdoors, with the herds largely isolated from each other. But what’s happening now is different.

Three-quarters of US hogs are raised on the 3,600 largest operations, each averaging more than 14,000 animals.

Starting in the 1980s, US pork packers began to change their model, inspired by what the poultry industry had done decades before. Instead of buying hogs from small producers, meatpacking companies moved to a vertically integrated model, pushing to source their pigs from large, confined operations working under production contracts.

The shift turned the industry upside down. According to US Census of Agriculture figures, in 1982, 330,000 farms raised 55.4 million hogs. By 2017, just 66,000 farms were churning out more than 72 million pigs. In other words, 80 percent of US hog farms exited the business over that period even as total output jumped 21 percent—and so the average number of hogs per farm spiked from 168 to 2,000, a 12-fold increase. And that figure understates the scale of modern hog production. The 2017 Ag Census show that three-quarters of US hogs are raised on the 3,600 largest operations, each averaging more than 14,000 animals.

Today, an industrial-scale hog “barn” is an enclosed facility holding as many as 4,440 pigs. A typical operation consists of several of these buildings clumped together, each with ventilation systems that have the potential to suck up airborne flu pathogens from each barn and pass them to the barn next door.

China’s pork sector, the globe’s largest, is rapidly mimicking the US model, though it’s at an earlier stage of the trajectory. Between 1975 and 2013, growth in China’s pork consumption rose by a factor of eight. (Though this growth has flattened in recent years.) Giant factory facilities took the place of the micro-scale operations that had sustained the region for centuries. In 2000, 74 percent of Chinese pork production came from backyard farms. By 2015, household sources were providing just 27 percent of the nation’s domestic pork. The contribution from commercial farms with at least 1,000 hogs, meanwhile, tripled over that decade.

Factory farms are “an explosive evolutionary accelerant.”

What could possibly go wrong? Rob Wallace, an evolutionary biologist with the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps and author of Big Farms Make Big Flu, argues that the industrial animal farming model delivers a perfect habitat for flus to proliferate, evolve, mutate, and adapt—to essentially hack the numbers game for creating pandemic strains. Factory-scale farms provide a huge playground for human and avian flus to “trade multiple combinations of genetic segments,” he said. They’re “an explosive evolutionary accelerant.”

For most of the 20th century, the flus circulating among US pigs didn’t evolve much genetically, meaning our immune systems had plenty of time to adapt the ability to fight them off. It wasn’t until the 1990s—when the consolidation of US hog production was reaching a crescendo—that pig flus began to reassort wildly with human and avian flus and create new strains that can jump to people. In a prescient paper he co-authored with other researchers, published five years before the 2009 outbreak, the WHO’s Webby sounded the alarm. “The influenza reservoir in the United States swine population has thus gone from a stable single viral lineage” to a “dynamic viral reservoir containing multiple viral lineages,” making the US swine population an “increasingly important reservoir of viruses with human pandemic potential,” they wrote.

In addition to capitalizing on the sheer number of potential hosts breathing in each other’s exhalations and excretions in a modern hog facility, viruses also take advantage of the pigs’ genetic similarity. With a genetically diverse drove, some pigs will have a mutation in their immune systems that blocks infection, limiting the pathogen’s range. But “if you’ve got a couple thousand genetically similar hogs packed in a barn, then it’s all food for flu,” Wallace said. As the industry breeds hogs to deliver consistent, uniform pork products, the genetic diversity of hog populations erodes, and what Wallace calls an “important firewall” to developing pandemic flu strains crumbles.

The workers who tend these pigs are prime targets for moving the virus into surrounding communities. And global trade ensures that the flu can travel the world. “The United States and Canada, the largest exporters of hog, are also the largest exporters of swine flu,” Wallace said. After the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994, Mexico began to dramatically scale up its own hog sector, leaning heavily on hogs imported from the United States and Europe. That flow of hogs and their attendant flus is the likely source of the 2009 triple-assorted pandemic strain, a 2016 analysis by US, Mexican, and European researchers shows. Wallace also points to a 2015 Nature study by a global team led by US National Institutes of Health researchers with a chart showing how flu bugs circulating on US farms disperse globally:

The US pork industry, for its part, asserts that the workers who tend hogs are unlikely to swap viruses with them, because hog farmers follow stringent biosecurity measures. “Modern US pig barns are designed specifically for pig health and safety,” Jason Menke, director of marketing communications for the National Pork Board, wrote in an email. Farmers wear special boots and clothing that stay in the barn. Many farms require caretakers to shower in special facilities attached to the barn, which “minimizes the chance that the pigs will be exposed to a pathogen that will make them ill.” Workers are also “encouraged” to wear personal-protective gear like masks to “protect themselves from both illness and injury working on the farm,” Menke wrote. He added that “sick leave policies encourage workers to stay home when ill to prevent unnecessarily exposure to other workers on site or to the pigs, since pigs can be infected with human influenza strains.”

But no biosecurity system is perfect, Wallace counters. In a 2015 paper looking at flu strains circulating on US pig farms, the National Institutes of Health and US Department of Agriculture researchers found that, despite the industry’s biosecurity efforts after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, industry workers “continuously” kept reinfecting the US hog herd with their flus. That meant hogs, mixing vessels for human and bird flus, got a steady infusions of human-adapted flus, free to re-assort and create novel strains that can infect people.

Wallace thinks that factory-scale livestock farming inherently generates viral pandemic threat, and should thus be dismantled—a view that gained political traction late last year when Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) floated a bill that would do just that. Booker’s proposal, which has since gained support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), remains unlikely to pass; the meat industry wields massive lobbying power in Washington. But as Ezra Klein recently reported in Vox, an “odd-bedfellows coalition” of animal-rights activists, economic populists, and small-scale farmers is rallying around it.

Mainstream university-based flu researchers are far more cautious about challenging the industry so directly. While Duke’s Gray insisted that the next pandemic might come from hogs, he does not advocate for banning industrial hog farming. “We have some of the safest and lowest-cost pork production in the world, and that’s wonderful,” he said. “And we are exporting that technology to many places around the world and they’re all shifting to large-scale farming—it’s the way to go to keep the hogs safe and produce low cost meat.”

He adds, however, that the pork industry and the US Department of Agriculture—which regulates the safety of meat production—aren’t doing enough to monitor the viral pathogens that can flourish on large hog operations. Through surveillance, researchers can see what’s out there and kick-start the development of human vaccines when novel strains emerge.

Back in 2010, in response to the previous year’s pandemic, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a division of the US Department of Agriculture, launched a program to monitor and analyze flus circulating in the hog population. It’s an important but limited effort, Gray said. It relies on hog producers and veterinarians to swab animals showing flu symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose, etc.) and send them in to USDA-affiliated labs. Gray characterized the program as “very spotty” because of its focus on “passive” testing, which relies on farmers to volunteer samples from sick animals.

Active testing, on the other hand, would randomly select samples from both visibly sick and asymptomatic animals. “There are influenza viruses that infect both humans and pigs [but] do not necessarily cause signs of infection in both,” he said. Similar to how people can be infected with COVID-19 and spread it without showing symptoms, pig flu often hides in animals that appear healthy. “Hence, I have long argued that passive surveillance among only sick pigs has the potential to miss novel emerging swine influenza viruses that may harm humans.”



The US hog industry is “really good” at detecting and preventing the spread of diseases that make pigs sick and lower production, Gray says. But viruses that don’t directly harm hogs—including those that might do worse damage to humans—”are tolerated, permitted to spread and to mutate.”

Worse still, Gray adds, as the 2009 flu pandemic recedes into the past, funding for the APHIS surveillance program—and the participation of hog farmers—has dwindled. In the agency’s most recent report on the program, released in July 2020, total samples received from farmers peaked in 2015 at 35,792 and had fallen to 3,098 in 2019. An APHIS spokesperson attributed the drop to changes made in 2016 to shift costs from the USDA budget on to hog farmers.

Meanwhile, influenzas aren’t the only viruses that circulate on hog farms. Coronaviruses do, too—like the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, which killed 10 percent of US hogs in 2013-14. (PEDV does not infect humans). As for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing the current COVID-19 pandemic, a study released in June by Chinese researchers found that pigs are at least theoretically susceptible: They have lung and kidney cells that can be invaded by this particular pathogen. But laboratory attempts to infect pigs with it have so far not succeeded. “Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is still progressing and SARS-CoV-2 strains are constantly evolving,” they wrote, “we need to keep monitoring and evaluating the possibility of pigs to become intermediate hosts” of the pathogen.

Gray finds the prospect of hog-adapted SARS-CoV-2 daunting. As they do for flu, pigs could emerge as what disease researchers call a “reservoir” for the pathogen—a large host population that keeps the pathogen circulating, giving it more opportunity to infect people. “My chief concern is that the current SARS-CoV-2 virus adapts to commercial hogs, becomes amplified in them, and causes widespread infections, increasing the risk of the virus moving from the pigs to infect humans who have not been previously infected,” he said. He expressed an even darker possibility: The “remote chance” that if it does manage to enter the pig population, it could mutate into something different, yet another “novel coronavirus” that would require a whole new scramble for a vaccine.

“We’re really seeing for the first time in most people’s living memory the impacts these pandemics can have on society.”

“Honestly, I don’t know if we’re much better off post-2009 than we were pre-2009,” the WHO’s Webby said. Governments devoted resources to preventing the next big flu outbreak for a few years, but interest faded as the event receded into the past, he said. With COVID-19, “we’re really seeing for the first time in most people’s living memory the impacts these pandemics can have on society. So I’m hoping a silver lining from this will be more sustained resources into preparedness.”



Another possibility would be to rethink how we produce meat. The coronavirus pandemic has sparked calls to ban “wet markets”—the informal food markets that often include live wild animals, the possible point at which SARS-CoV-2 jumped from bats to people. As Wallace points out, globally, the biomass of the animals we eat—their sheer physical weight—is now “far greater” than their wild counterparts. “Planet Earth is basically Planet Farm,” he said. “When you populate the globe with cities of hogs and poultry, you’re going to generate novel pathogens” that confound human immunology, he added. Maybe the fear of another pandemic will finally force us to ramp down the scale of our livestock operations and adapt to diets that depend on way less meat."
Expert warns the US is approaching 'one of the most unstable times in the history of our country',https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/11/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html,"(CNN) With rising Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations sending many states backward in their reopening plans, one health expert warns that if the US continues on its current path it will reach ""one of the most unstable times in the history of our country.""

""We will have hospitals overwhelmed and not only in terms of ICU beds and hospitals -- and that's bad -- but exhausted hospital staff and hospital staff that's getting ill themselves,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN Friday night. ""So, we won't have enough manpower, human power, to manage all of this.""

Only five states saw a decrease of at least 10% in average new daily cases over the past week. And the US set a record for the highest single day of new cases for the second time this week with 66,627 cases on Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

There have been more than 3,225,721 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, Johns Hopkins University said. That's more than the population of 21 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico, according to data from the US Census Bureau.

At least 134,580 people have died from complications of the virus.

The resurgence has many local leaders returning to actions taken in March and April to slow the spread of the virus.

At least 26 states have paused or rolled back their plans to reopen.

Atlanta's mayor and Georgia's governor are at odds over the mayor's order Friday to send her city back to Phase 1 of its reopening plan. Citing an ""alarming"" increase in cases, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said residents under this phase should leave the house only for essential trips, and restaurants and retailers must offer only to-go or curbside pickup service.

Gov. Brian Kemp's office said the mayor's plan is not ""legally enforceable"" because Kemp signed an order prohibiting local action from being more prohibitive than the state's requirements. To free the capacity for more testing and hospital care in a surge, Kemp reactivated a makeshift hospital Friday at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta.

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott renewed a disaster declaration first issued March 13 to mitigate spread in his state, while Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested the extension of National Guard use through December for humanitarian missions such as running mobile screenings, distributing food and medical supplies and disinfecting public spaces.

""All people who study these viruses think that the summer is the quiet time. Think about that. This is the quiet time for coronavirus,"" Dr. William Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School, told CNN on Friday. ""If this is the quiet time, I hate to think what winter is going to be like this year.""

Disney World reopens as Florida cases and hospitalizations soar

Even as Florida flirts with records for daily cases and soaring hospitalizations, one of its biggest tourist attractions reopened Saturday.

Disney World opened its Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom Park near Orlando to the general public for the first time since shutting down over the pandemic. The reopenings come with restrictions and adjustments, including capacity limits, requiring pre-registration, and temperature screenings.

Florida recorded 11,433 new Covid-19 cases Thursday -- its second-highest count for one day -- the state said Friday.

And hospitalizations are rising.

A total of 7,063 people are hospitalized in Florida with Covid-19 as the primary diagnosis, the state's Agency for Health Care Administration said Saturday. That's an increase of 72 patients from the prior day.

In Florida's Miami-Dade County, a county bus driver died after testing positive for Covid-19, and more than 40 others tested positive in the last three weeks, the county transportation department said.

The driver who died ""was working in June before testing positive,"" department spokeswoman Ileen Delgado said.

By Friday, Covid-19 hospitalizations in the county had risen by 74% since June 27. The county also has seen an 88% increase in the number of ICU beds being used and an 123% increase in the use of ventilators since then, according to Miami-Dade County government data.

In Pembroke Pines in nearby Broward County, ""we are busting at the seams in the emergency room,"" Leah Carpenter, a nurse and CEO of Memorial West hospital, told CNN affiliate WPLG Friday.

""My ICU is beyond capacity ... But I have the ability to expand as needed,"" she said.

Positive cases within the Broward Sheriff's Office Department of Fire Rescue went from 17 on Monday to 34 by Friday, said Jason Smith, president of the International Association of Firefighters in Broward.

""We're spreading it amongst ourselves and people are significantly sick, very sick,"" Smith said in a letter to county leaders.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said the state can handle the spikes. He told reporters Friday that no major hospital system in the state ""has even gone to, like, a surge level.""

DeSantis said Saturday more than 1,000 contract workers will soon be sent around the state to boost coronavirus-related staffing, such as at new facilities that accept and treat only Covid-patients from long-term care homes, or to support testing.

A record-setting day to end a record-setting week

The US has set records for coronavirus infections and hospitalizations this summer -- and this week has been no different.

Georgia set a record for the number of new cases in one day on Friday with 4,484 new cases, according to the state's department of health. The state's previous record was set on June 26.

Also on Friday, the US reported its highest number of new cases in one day for the second time this week. The previous record for the US was set just one day earlier.

Several states set their own records.

Texas reported 10,351 new cases Saturday, topping the previous record of 10,028 set July 7, according to the Department of State Health Services. There are 10,083 patients hospitalized statewide due to the virus, with only 930 ICU beds available Saturday.

South Carolina on Saturday reported 2,239 cases from a day earlier, breaking the previous daily high by 300 cases.

The Louisiana Department of Health reported 2,642 new cases Friday, making it the highest day of new cases since the pandemic began. On Saturday, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced a statewide mask order.

California, which has held rank as one of the hardest hit states, continued to set records in coronavirus hospitalization and ICU rates this week, with over 6,000 patients being treated.

Wisconsin reported 926 new cases Saturday, breaking the record set the day before, the state Department of Health Services said in a tweet.

Hospitals stretched thin

Hospital capacity -- a concern in many places when the pandemic first broke out -- is being raised as a pressing issue once again.

An ICU nurse at Banner Health in Arizona said the staff and the three coronavirus ICUs at the hospital where she works are already stretched thin.

""Now, we're kind of at the point where we are stretched so thin, we are at the point of compromising patient safety,"" Lauren Leander told CNN on Thursday.

It's a familiar story. In Riverside County, California, 10 out of 17 hospitals are at or above 100% capacity of licensed ICU beds, county spokesperson Brooke Federico said."
"Jobless claims: Another 837,000 Americans filed new unemployment claims last week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jobless-claims-coronavirus-unemployment-week-ended-september-26-2020-101027132.html,"The US economy saw yet another historically high number of first-time unemployment insurance claims filed last week, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to strain the labor market.

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday. Here were the main metrics from the report, compared to Bloomberg estimates:

Initial jobless claims, week ended Sept. 26: 837,000 vs. 850,000 expected and 873,000 during the prior week

Continuing claims, week ended Sept. 19: 11.767 million vs. 12.2 million expected and 12.747 million during the prior week

Another 837,000 individuals filed new jobless claims last week, for a marginal step down from the upwardly revised 873,000 reported for the prior period and a level better than consensus economists had been expecting. This marked the fifth straight week that new jobless claims come in below 1 million. On a seasonally unadjusted basis, claims also declined, falling by more than 40,000 to 786,942.

But six months since the pandemic took hold in the US and decimated economic activity, new jobless claims are still running far above levels from before the outbreak. As recently as in February this year, new jobless claims were coming in at a rate of around 200,000 per week.

The majority of states reported improvements in unadjusted new claims last week. That was led by Florida with a decline of more 9,600 claims to about 29,000, and Texas and Georgia each also reported sizable declines in new claims. Maryland and Illinois, on the other hand, each added the most new claims at about 2,800 and 1,900, respectively.

In its report this week, the Labor Department included in a technical note that California announced a two-week pause in processing initial unemployment claims “to reduce its claims processing backlog and implement fraud prevention technology,” according to the statement. California had in recent weeks been the consistent leader among states for new claims added and total jobless claims.

Story continues

Continuing jobless claims, reported on a one-week lag and reflecting the number of individuals still receiving unemployment benefits, have also come down from their pandemic-era highs but stagnated at high levels. Continuing claims declined to 11.767 million in the latest print, to mark a pandemic-era low and first print below 12 million since early April, but a level that still tops the pre-pandemic record high of 6.6 million continuing claims filed in one week during June 2009.

“Initial claims, which seem to be stabilizing at an elevated level, suggest the labor market recovery is plateauing,” Nomura economist Lewis Alexander said in a note Sep. 25. “That said, recent declines in continuing claims suggest that rehiring activity continued to offset declines.”

New jobless claims, seasonally adjusted, decreased to 837,000 for the week ended Sep. 26. Consensus economists expected 850,000 new claims. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)

Still, a wave of new layoffs from major corporations looms. On Tuesday, Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 jobs in its resort business, in one of the deepest reductions announced so far during the pandemic period. Shell (RDS-A) on Wednesday said it planned to slash up to 9,000 positions by the end of 2022. And airlines including American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts following the October lapse of provisions under Congress’s CARES Act that gave the industry billions to help keep workers on payrolls.

The latest weekly jobless claims print comes a day before the Labor Department’s monthly September jobs report, which consensus economists believe will show the first monthly increase in payrolls of less than 1 million since April. ADP’s private payroll report out Wednesday – an imprecise but typically at least directionally accurate indicator of the payroll changes reflected in the Labor Department’s reports – showed private employers added back a better than expected 759,000 jobs during the month.

The Labor Department’s survey week for the non-farm payrolls report takes place around the 12th of each month. During that week, continuing jobless claims ticked down slightly to 12.58 million from 12.75 million. Initial claims also fell slightly to 866,000 during that week, from 893,000 the prior week.

“Bezos admits that the limitless growth that made him the world's richest man is incompatible with a habitable Earth.”,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3k3kwb/jeff-bezos-is-a-post-earth-capitalist,"Thursday night, ultra-billionaire Jeff Bezos—whose net worth is in excess of $157 billion—outlined a vision of an “incredible civilization” with trillions of people living in space, at a small, invite only event in Washington, DC.

Bezos organized the event to unveil a new lunar lander developed by his space company Blue Origin. But the specifications of this lunar lander matter less than Bezos’s vision of utopia.

Bezos pitched a version of the future that’s departed from the reality of capitalism, climate change, and the intractable connections between those two things. Bezos admits that limitless growth—the growth that made him the richest man in the world—is incompatible with a habitable earth. But instead of announcing investments in renewable energy or public infrastructure, Bezos pitches an escape from earth.

Bezos argued that space “colonies” are a solution to humanity’s “long range” problems, like energy availability and ceilings on capitalist notions of unfettered, limitless growth. Space colonies, Bezos said, are a way to expand the human population and offset the impacts of agriculture and industry on Earth. This strategy, according to Bezos, leaves Earth an idyllic paradise: a place to go on vacation, a place to go to college—in other words, a place for the elite.

“We get to have both,” Bezos said. “We get to preserve this unique gem of a planet, which is completely irreplaceable. There is no plan B. We have to save this planet, and we shouldn’t give up a future of our grandchildren’s grandchildren of dynamism and growth. We can have both.”

He’s wrong.

Bezos argues that a capitalist logic of endless growth is the way to save the Earth from poverty, homelessness, and environmental catastrophe. (Bezos does not say “climate change” or “global warming” but “pollution.”) However, capitalism is an economic system that is inextricably tied with colonial history, enslaving people and exploiting laborers, and extracting and stripping as much away from the Earth as possible in order to fuel growth. Capitalism is not the solution to the problems that Bezos describes. It’s the root of the problem.

Lisa Lowe, a professor of American studies at Yale Universities who has written extensively about colonial and capitalist history, explains in her book The Intimacies of the Four Continents that the classic liberal, pro-capitalism ideas of freedom, fairly-waged labor, and “free trade” have always hinged on certain people not getting access to those privileges: namely, people native or indigenous to the Americas, Africa, and Asia.

The shift from mercantilism to capitalism in the nineteenth century was accompanied by economic growth in Western, colonizing nations, but not enslaved or colonized populations. The privileges of capitalism have been conditional from the start.

“It is the pronounced asymmetry of the colonial divisions of humanity that is the signature feature of liberal modes of distinction that privilege particular subjects and societies as rational, civilized, and human,” Lowe writes, “and treat others as the laboring, replaceable, or disposable contexts that constitute that humanity.""

The exploitation of these people was directly accompanied by the exploitation of the Earth. In her book This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein referred to this logic as “extractivism”: this mindset, which informs and fuels capitalism, argues that humans are the rulers of the Earth, and therefore, humans are entitled to take as much as they want from it.

“It is the opposite of stewardship, which involves taking but also taking care that regeneration and future life continue,” Klein writes. “It is also the reduction of human beings either into labor to be brutally extracted, pushed beyond limits, or, alternatively, into social burden, problems to be locked out at borders and locked away in prisons or reservations.”

Klein explains that extractivism also relies on “sacrifice zones,” places that capitalist leaders deem acceptable losses. They’re places that are “drained, poisoned, or otherwise destroyed” for the sake of corporate or shareholder profit.

These “sacrifice zones” are the same place from which colonizers enslaved, exploited, and subjugated native and indigenous populations. They’re also the same places that are the most vulnerable to climate change. Think about Mozambique, which has been devastated by an unprecedented wave of back-to-back tropical cyclones. Think about Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, which is simultaneously sinking and flooding, and displacing residents from an ancient cultural hub. Think about Myanmar, a country plagued by civil war and genocide, which just experienced a mudslide that killed 54 people.

None of these events are “natural disasters,” or coincidences. They’re earth-system-driven disasters striking areas that the so-called invisible hand of the market has deemed worthy of sacrifice and destruction. This is climate change and colonialism simultaneously.

Meanwhile, Bezos is arguing that we’re going to have trillions of people living on rotating cylinders in space, complete with trains, farms, and recreational zero G zones. He doesn’t talk about the resources that will be extracted along the way, or the working class people whose labor is necessary to create this luxury. Instead, he reiterates a classic science-fiction trope of zero-gravity adventure and opulence.

Bezos uses the same logic of climate “realists” who say that economic regulations and redistributive policies are less realistic than geo-engineering, or in this case, spending hundreds of billions of dollars building the infrastructure necessary to transplant humans from the Earth to space.

And now space, according to Bezos, is going to be a place for industry. It will be a place controlled by private companies, entrepreneurs, and first movers.

“What you’re going to do is you’re going to have whole industries,” Bezos said. “There are going to be thousands of future companies doing this work. A whole system of entrepreneurial activity, unleashed. Creative people coming up with new ideas about how to use space.”

Private entities like Amazon will be in charge of how to divide up space responsibly and treat workers ethically. But why should we expect Bezos to govern an Earth-space civilization ethically when he has not even governed his own company ethically?

Building a profit-driven future in space, according to Bezos, must also involve giving the earth a new purpose: being a haven for vacation and college, activities that are largely associated with the elite.

“Earth ends up zoned, residential, and light industry,” Bezos said. “It’ll be a beautiful place to live, it’ll be a beautiful place to visit, it’ll be a beautiful place to go to college, and do some light industry.”

This version of the future—at least, to the elaborate and specific extent that Bezos is pitching it—won’t happen. Bezos is using the same PR strategy that has been so successful for Elon Musk by pitching an elaborate, extraterrestrial future in order to draw people’s attention away from the glaring problems within their current, terrestrial business ventures (or personal brands).

In this case, Bezos is characterizing himself as the genius pioneer with the heart, spirit, and courage necessary to advance humanity toward a better future. But this vision of a better future is completely detached from reality. He’s tapping into a cowboy, frontier mythology that has always benefited the military and corporate agendas of men who look like him.

“Do we want stasis and rationing or do we want dynamism and growth?” Bezos asked. “This is an easy choice. We know what we want.”

But he’s setting up a false premise, and he’s advocating for future written by and for captains of industry without input from anyone else, or concern for how they will be impacted.

Sweeping policy proposals like the Green New Deal outline a version of the future with redistributive economic policies, with subsidies are moved away from the fossil fuel industry and into renewable energy, and with governments that make investments in public transportation and social services. It’s version of the future that’s focused on fairness, equity, and real human bodies. It’s a version of the future that is grounded on Earth, and not science-fiction."
"Trump Wants to Erase Protections in Alaska's Tongass National Forest, an old-growth rainforest which is a major North American carbon sink",https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16102019/tongass-national-forest-trump-roadless-rule-logging-climate-change,"The Trump Administration wants to allow logging in previously off-limit areas of Alaska's Tongass National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service announced Tuesday, a move that could turn one of the nation's largest carbon sinks into a source of new climate-changing emissions.

The old-growth temperate rainforest contains trees that are centuries old and play a crucial role in storing carbon. In a state that is synonymous with oil production, the Tongass National Forest represents the potential for natural solutions to help combat the climate crisis.

A 9.4-million acre swath of the Tongass has been protected under a Clinton-era requirement called the Roadless Rule, which safeguarded 58 million acres of undeveloped national forest lands from roadbuilding, logging and mineral leasing. But the Tongass has long been an area of hot dispute.

The Forest Service is now moving to exempt the rainforest — and make tens of thousands of old-growth acres available to logging.

Sign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories. Your inbox. Every weekend.

""The Tongass National Forest stores more carbon removed from the atmosphere than any other national forest in the country,"" said Josh Hicks, campaign manager at The Wilderness Society. ""By seeking to weaken the Roadless Rule's protections, the Forest Service is prioritizing one forest use — harmful logging— over mitigating climate change, protecting wildlife habitat, and offering unmatched sight-seeing and recreation opportunities found only in southeast Alaska.""

In August, Trump ordered Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to exclude the area from the Roadless Rule. The draft environmental impact statement — expected later this week — will aim to do just that, according to a press release issued on Tuesday that describes the administration's plan. If enacted, it would allow roads to be built throughout the now-protected area, and it would convert 165,000 old-growth acres and 20,000 young-growth acres previously identified as unsuitable timber lands to suitable timber lands.

The Alaskan delegation had been pushing for a relaxation of the rule, arguing that the prohibition on developing that area negatively affects the state's ability to harvest timber, develop minerals and expand energy projects. ""I thank President Trump, Secretary Perdue, and the team at the Forest Service for their hard work to reach this point — and for their continued efforts to restore reasonable access to the Tongass National Forest,"" said Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).

Protections for roughly 5.7 million acres of the forest designated as wilderness lands will remain intact.

A Major Carbon Sink

From a climate perspective, the plan could have global implications.

""The longer those trees are out there, the longer they have been absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and holding onto it — sequestration. That results in excess carbon that the plants store over time,"" said Dominick DellaSala, the chief scientist at the Geos Institute in Oregon, a nonprofit that studies climate solutions. ""In the case of an old-growth forest, some of those trees have been out there for 400, 500 years, absorbing and storing carbon and helping to keep the planet cool.""

The ancient trees in the Tongass store at least 8 percent of the total carbon absorbed by all national forests in the lower 48 states, DellaSala said. ""When we clear-cut a forest, most of the carbon is put back into the atmosphere,"" he said.

A report released by the United Nations one year ago found that in order to keep global warming below 1.5°C, the world will need to find ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Part of that requires the development and scaling of new technologies. But natural solutions must play a role, too, the report found.

Trump's action is ""going to put more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a time when we need to be drastically reducing emissions and getting off of fossil fuels and keeping carbon stores in places like the Tongass,"" DellaSala said.

History on Their Side

The Tongass National Forest represents the latest step in the Trump administration's efforts to open up public lands to industry, which have led to clashes with environmental groups.

Those fights are well underway elsewhere in Alaska. The administration is working to allow drilling in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and in new areas of the National Petroleum Reserve. It is trying to ease protections in salmon streams and to allow open pit copper and gold mining at Pebble Mine, on the shores of Bristol Bay.

In the Tongass, as with the other areas in Alaska, attorneys representing environmental groups are closely watching the Trump administration's moves to see if there are opportunities to sue.

""The agency will have to issue a final impact statement, which is expected next year,"" said Eric Jorgensen, Earthjustice managing attorney in Juneau.""Then at that point, there could be challenges to the rule so we and others will be giving it the closest scrutiny. We don't think the agency will be able to marshal the arguments to justify the exemption.""

Environmental groups will have history on their side, Jorgensen said.

President George W. Bush tried unsuccessfully to overturn the Roadless Rule's application to the Tongass. ""We filed a lawsuit with others challenging that exemption and the district court in Alaska, and ultimately the 9th circuit court of appeals rejected the decision, holding that the agency has not justified its change in position,"" Jorgensen said."
'The most intellectual creature to ever walk Earth is destroying its only home' | Jane Goodall | Environment,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/03/the-most-intellectual-creature-to-ever-walk-earth-is-destroying-its-only-home,"During my years studying chimpanzees in Gombe national park in Tanzania I experienced the magic of the rainforest. I learned how all life is interconnected, how each species, no matter how insignificant it may seem, has a role to play in the rich tapestry of life – known today as biodiversity. Even the loss of one thread can have a ripple effect and result in major damage to the whole.

I left Gombe in 1986 when I realised how fast chimpanzee habitat was being destroyed and how their numbers were declining. I visited six chimpanzee range states and learned a great deal about the rate of deforestation as a result of foreign corporations (timber, oil and mining) and population growth in communities in and around chimpanzee habitat, so that more land was needed for expanding villages, agriculture and grazing livestock.

Chimpanzees were affected by the bushmeat trade – the commercial hunting of wild animals for food. I saw traumatised infants, whose mother had been killed – either for the same bushmeat or the illegal live animal trade, for sale in the markets, or in inappropriate zoos where they had been placed after confiscation by local authorities.

But I also learned about the problems faced by so many African communities in and around chimpanzee habitat. When I arrived in Gombe in 1960 it was part of what was called the equatorial forest belt, stretching from East Africa through the Congo Basin to the West African coast. By 1980 it was a tiny island of forest surrounded by bare hills, with more people living there than the land could support, over-farmed soil, trees cut down on all but the steepest slopes by people desperate to grow food for their families or make money from charcoal. I realised that unless we could improve their lives we could not even try to protect the chimpanzees.

But chimpanzees, and many other species are still highly endangered. Over the last 100 years chimpanzee numbers have dropped from perhaps two million to a maximum of 340,000, many living in fragmented patches of forest. Several thousand apes are killed or taken captive for the illegal wildlife trade. Orangutans and gibbons are losing their habitats due to the proliferation of non-sustainable oil palm plantations. We are experiencing the sixth great extinction. The most recent report from WWF describes the situation as critical – in the last 40 years, we have lost some 60% of all animal and plant species on Earth.

We are poisoning the soil through large-scale industrial agriculture. Invasive species are choking out native animal and plant life in many places. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere by our reliance on fossil fuels, destruction of the rain forests and pollution of the ocean. Increase of demand for meat not only involves horrible cruelty to billions of animals in factory farms, but huge areas of wild habitats are destroyed to grow crops for animal feed.

So much fossil fuel is required to take grain to animals, animals to slaughter, meat to table – and during digestion these animals are producing methane – an even more virulent gas than carbon dioxide. And their waste along with other industrial agricultural runoff is polluting soil and rivers sometimes causing toxic algae blooms over large areas of ocean.

How come the most intellectual creature to ever walk Earth is destroying its only home?

Climate change is a very real threat as spelled out in the latest UN report, as these greenhouse gases, trapping the heat of the sun, are causing the melting of polar ice, rising sea levels, more frequent and more intense storms, flooding and droughts. In some places agricultural yields are decreasing, fuelling human displacement and conflict. How come the most intellectual creature to ever walk Earth is destroying its only home?

Because many policymakers and corporations – and we as individuals – tend to make a decision based on “How will this affect me now, affect the next shareholders meeting, the next political campaign?” rather than “How will this affect future generations?” Mother nature is being destroyed at an ever-faster rate for the sake of short term gain. This, along with our horrifying population growth, poverty – causing people to destroy the environment simply to try to make a living, and the unsustainable lifestyles of the rest of us who have way more than we need, is the root cause of all the planet’s woes.

It is depressing to realise how much change I have witnessed during my 84 years. I have seen the ice melting in Greenland, the glaciers vanishing on Mount Kilimanjaro and around the world. When I arrived in Gombe the chimpanzee population stretched for miles along the shores of Lake Tanganyika. Buffalo, common then, are locally extinct and only a few leopards remain.

The water of the lake was crystal clear, fish and water cobras were abundant, and there were crocodiles. But with soil washed into the lake and over-fishing, that changed. When I spent time in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro in the 60s and early 70s, rhino and elephants were plentiful. Today they have become highly endangered, killed for their tusks and horns. I grew up in the south of England. The dawn chorus of the birds was magical – so many of them have gone, along with the hedgehogs that used to rustle though the vegetation at night. In May and June we had to draw the curtains at night to keep out the hundreds of cockchafers – May bugs, attracted to the light – today it is rare to see even one, and the clouds of mosquitos and midges are almost gone.

Yet, I believe we have a small window of opportunity when, if we get together, we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted. Everywhere, where young people understand the problems and are empowered to take action – when we listen to their voices, they are making a difference. With our superior intellect we are coming up with technological solutions to help us live in greater harmony with nature and reduce our own ecological footprints. We have a choice each day as to what we buy, eat and wear. And nature is amazingly resilient – there are no more bare hills around Gombe, as an example. Species on the brink of extinction have been given a second chance. We can reach out to the world through social media in a way never before possible. And there is the indomitable human spirit, the people who tackle the impossible and won’t give up. My job is to give people hope, for without it we fall into apathy and do nothing.

Trump Plans to Expand the Federal Invasion of American Cities,https://www.motherjones.com/anti-racism-police-protest/2020/07/trump-border-patrol-cities-portland-chicago/,"For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis, the election, and more, subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter.

President Donald Trump plans to assert new authority this week to dispatch federal law enforcement agents to American cities to quell “unrest,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Sunday on Fox News.

“Attorney General Barr is weighing in on that with [acting Homeland Security] Secretary [Chad] Wolf, and you’ll see something rolled out this week, as we start to go in and make sure that the communities—whether it’s Chicago or Portland or Milwaukee or someplace across the heartland of the country—we need to make sure their communities are safe,” Meadows said.

President Trump is committed to standing up to the radical mobs that want to tear down our communities. “Some of the unrest we saw… it’s just not acceptable.” This is about keeping our communities safe! pic.twitter.com/TV1CpgUfZV — Trump War Room – Text TRUMP to 88022 (@TrumpWarRoom) July 19, 2020

Trump’s critics say he is deploying armed federal officers to cities in an effort to help his reelection effort. The Trump campaign lent support to those claims Sunday by gleefully tweeting out Meadows’ comments.

Meadows referred to the ongoing federal presence in Portland, Oregon. There—in defiance of requests by local officials—the Homeland Security Department and the US Marshalls Service are claiming authority to police Black Lives Matter protests and to make arrests. In Portland, Border Patrol teams have detained people, and federal agents have reportedly used tear gas against protesters. (Protesters have alleged Border Patrol officers failed to clearly identify themselves when making arrests, though the agency disputes that.)

The Feds justify their presence in Portland by citing a June 26 executive order in which Trump directed them to protect statues, monuments, and federal property. They say they are protecting the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and other federal property in the city. The Border Patrol also says its agents are deputized to help the Federal Protective Service guard federal facilities, a role that the DHS secretary has statutory power to give them.

But Meadows suggested the Trump administration wants to broaden its legal justification to allow federal agencies to expand their presence in other locations. Notably he cited Chicago, where the issue drawing national attention is gun violence, not political unrest. Trump has previously threatened to “send in the Feds” if Chicago “doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on.”

“The statues are one thing, but it’s really about keeping out communities safe, and the president is committed to do that,” Meadows said.

These plans are sure to draw condemnation from Democrats and other Trump critics already denouncing the administration’s actions in Portland. On Sunday, the chairs of three House committees—Judiciary, Oversight and Homeland Security—asked inspectors general in the Justice and Homeland Security departments to investigate the “use of federal law enforcement agencies by the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security to suppress First Amendment protected activities in Washington, DC, Portland, and other communities across the United States.”"
"Nearly unbeatable and difficult to identify fungus has adapted to global warming and can now survive the warm body temperature of humans. With a 50% mortality rate in 90 days, meet Candida auris, the first pathogenic fungus caused by human-induced global warming",https://projectvesta.org/why-every-degree-of-warming-matters-nearly-unbeatable-and-difficult-to-identify-fungus-has-adapted-to-global-warming-and-can-now-survive-the-warm-body-temperature-of-humans-with-a-50-mortality-rate/,"Cadida auris, is a fugus that is “pretty much unbeatable and difficult to identify,” and which the CDC says causes nearly 50% of patients to die within 90 days. It has an overall mortality rate of 30%-60%. If you get this thing, it is very likely that you will die before they have even figured out what you have. And it’s so persistent that after you die, the hospital has to tear out the ceiling tiles to fully rid the hospital of the fungus:

Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it. “Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,” said Dr. Scott Lorin, the hospital’s president. “The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.” Source

That last part about tearing out the ceiling tiles is what made me rewind the article as I listened to it back in April. Hospitals have had to shut down entire wings and even close entire hospitals because of C. auris . The reason you haven’t heard of it is because hospitals are reluctant to discuss C. auris and are fighting to keep infections secret because they are scared that no one will want to go to the hospital if this fungal invasion is present. The New York Times has a great series of articles on C. auris , and they go into the secrecy, and the reason you have likely not heard of it:

From this gem of an observation grew one of the most curious aspects of our series: The rise in resistant bugs is cloaked in widespread and chronic secrecy. As our reporting continued, we discovered it was common for hospitals, doctors and public health agencies to clam up when it came to talking about their troubles with resistant bugs, though they widely acknowledged the existence of the problem and even encouraged our efforts.

…

We came to realize that the secrecy surrounding C. auris was a big part of the story. A doctor in Spain wrote me that the hospital didn’t want bad press by seeming to be a hotbed of the fungus. I got the same message from a doctor in England. One doctor in New York told me that patients, and their families, don’t like being associated with the illness, as if they had a scarlet letter — “A” for auris.

Even with the secrecy, I knew I would hear about C. auris again some time soon. Since its discovery in 2009 on a Japanese man’s ear (named Auris from the Latin for “ear”), it reemerged in humans again a few times between 2012 and 2015, and what was remarkable is that it happened pretty much simultaneously on three separate continents. The worst part was that all three of the strains were genetically different. So not only is this fungi resilient and spreading, but there are actually multiple strains with different evolutionary lineages that can infect humans (pathogenic). That tells us this is something systemic is going on, not just something locally, and that this is a global problem.

This also isn’t one of those cases of a pathogen emerging from thawing permafrost. Those are an entirely different nightmare of a problem, an example of which happened during a heatwave in Sibera in 2016, when a herd of reindeer that had died from anthrax decades earlier and frozen under the tundra, thawed out and transmitted the bacteria to humans. Ultimately, they had to kill 250,000 reindeer to halt the spread. While that is of great concern and also keeps me up at night, it is not even in the same league as the systemic problem of fungus being more able to survive inside humans.

The first hypothesis I heard, as proposed in the in NYT article on the secrecy at hospitals, stated that the cause might be from the increased use of fungicides to treat crops. A man in Netherlands died in 2005 from a fungus called Aspergillus that was resistant to anti-fungal drug itraconazole was unable to prevent the infection of a man who in the. That drug happens to be pretty much the exact same thing as a pesticide class called Azoles. The graphic below shows the mechanisms of action that fungi can use to become resistant to fungicides.

The theory had been that the excessive spraying of fungicides on plants, such as potatoes, beans, wheat, tomatoes, etc caused and increase in drug resistance. The theory, as the head of the fungal branch at the C.D.C, Dr. Chiller, stated to the NYT, went something like this:

C. auris may have benefited from the heavy use of fungicides… C. auris actually has existed for thousands of years, hidden in the world’s crevices, a not particularly aggressive bug. But as azoles began destroying more prevalent fungi, an opportunity arrived for C. auris to enter the breach, a germ that had the ability to readily resist fungicides now suitable for a world in which fungi less able to resist are under attack.

While this theory is in some ways plausible for other strains, other research points to a different, much more worrying process for the evolution of C. auris and other salt marsh fungi. The new study suggests that Climate Change may actually be to blame. By becoming more able to counteract the effects of a warmer ecosystem, fungi are now able to overcome one of the major defense system of our body, a high average body temperature and even warmer temperatures when we have a fever.

Check out the chart below of the thermal tolerance of 40,802 fungal strains from 144 genera. Most of them cannot grow at mammalian temperatures and therefore, automatically gives us resistance. The normal human body is 36.5-37.5 °C (97.7-99.5 °F), but during a fever goes up to 37.5-38.3 °C (99.5-100.9 °F) and higher. In the chart below, the “squares” show 49 mammal core temperatures. The higher position of the “square” on the chart equates to a greater percentage of mammals whose bodies are in that temperature range. You can see that towards the right of the graph, around 35 degrees °C, fungi can no longer easily survive. It has been posited that this is not a coincidence, and is known as the “thermal exclusionary zone” and, as will be discussed below, may have even been the adaption that allowed mammals to come to dominate the planet in the face of fungal infections.



While the theory on the increased resistant of fungi to pesticides holds some validity, in this case, it appears something much more sinister and foreboding is at play. The theory doesn’t make complete sense in this case because C. auris appears to have emerged independently on three continents simultaneously: the Indian subcontinent, Venezuela, and South Africa.Further, the emergence of azole-resistant Candida began long before the appearance of C. auris and there appears to be no correlation to the emergence of the azole-resistant Aspergillus that was mentioned above. In addition, simply acquiring drug resistance, while making the fungi harder to kill, does not necessarily make it evolve to become pathogenic. Normally, a fungi would be known as a pathogen, then treated, then it would evolve drug resistance, instead of acquiring drug resistance from agricultural fungicide use first, then somehow evolving to become a pathogen.

Something else had to be at play then and a new paper titled “On the Emergence of Candida auris: Climate Change, Azoles, Swamps, and Birds,” posits that Candida auris’ rise is the “first example of a new fungal disease emerging from climate change.Think about that chart above that shows fungi unable to survive at higher temperatures. As the Earth becomes warmer, the fungi are evolving to survive at these higher temperatures. Those higher temperatures of the planet are now getting closer to and in some places surpassing the temperature of the human body (37.5 °C), essential threatening our body’s fungal immunity and closing our “thermal restriction zone” that prevents us from being infected.

“[A]s the climate has gotten warmer, some of these organisms, including Candida auris, have adapted to the higher temperature, and as they adapt, they break through human’s protective temperatures”

Co-author of the new study, Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chairman of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, said the above, and in his paper. I personally was unaware how strongly the effects of our warmer bodies was on preventing fungal infections until doing the research for this article.

In fact, there is an entire body of evidence on how the “thermal exclusionary zone” allowed mammals to surpass dinosaurs as the dominant species on Earth! The theory is called the “Fungal Filter,” and states that as Earth transitioned from the Cretaceous to the Tertiary period, a time known as the K-T boundary, that mammals became the dominant earth land form due to our body’s ability to resist fungus . The theory proposes that after the catastrophic event at the end of the Cretaceous period, when a massive asteroid hit Earth, photosynthesis was inhibited for at least 6 months and nearly all plants died, turning Earth into a “massive compost” where fungi thrived. Dinosaurs are massive animals and as such require lots of food to keep up their body temperatures. As they began to starve, they became cooler and were immunologically impaired, leading to them being unable to fend off infections from the now abundant fungi. The death of the dinosaurs from fungi, while mammals were selected for due to high-body temperatures and the so called thermal exclusion zone, allowed our ancestors us to inherit the earth.

To follow up on this theory, researchers point to the existence of fungal infections in mammals that are opportunistic, in both humans with compromised immune systems and in bats that lower their body temperatures during hibernation. Humans with HIV have high incidences of fungal infections such as oral Candida alibcans (candidiasis). Bats are susceptible to White-Nose syndrome:

“The white-nose syndrome in bats occurs during their hibernation process, when their temperature drops. The thermal restriction zone that protects mammals is the difference between their high basal temperatures and the environmental temperatures. Human-induced climate change is anticipated to warm Earth by several degrees in the 21st century, which will reduce the magnitude of the gradient between ambient temperatures and mammalian basal temperatures. Consequently, there is concern that higher ambient temperatures will lead to the selection of fungal lineages to become more thermally tolerant,such that they can breach the mammalian thermal restriction zone.

The really bad news here is that even if we don’t have lower body temperatures or compromised immune systems, fungi have been shown in directed evolution studies to be able to fairly quickly adapt to higher temperatures through a process called thermal selection. As cities are hotter than the surrounding areas due to the “heat island effect,” by comparing the same species of fungi in both in rural and city locations, scientists were able to clearly demonstrate fungal thermal selection, with the urban strains being more resilient to higher temperatures:

So knowing that warmer climatic conditions can cause the evolutionary selection for fungi that can withstand warm temperatures, Casadevall and his group compared the “thermal susceptibility” of C. auris to some of its close relatives and found that the majority of them were not yet tolerant to mammalian temperatures. That is good news, but as the study above shows, thermal selection of fungus can happen in a fairly short time period. In their reserach , they saw that Candida auris can survive up at up to 42 °C.

In the chart below, the color green represents temperatures that a fungus can stay alive at and red where it is cannot. I scaled the image from above so that you can see the temperature at which fungi can no longer survive compared against the body temperature of mammals. Any place there is the color green, to the right side of the black line at 37°C, is a type of fungus that could theoretically stay alive inside the human body. The bacteria all the way at the bottom, found in a forest mangrove can stay alive all the way up to 45°C (113°F), meaning even the highest fever you can have wouldn’t be able to kill it, and would probably kill you first.

That D. ranongensis strain all the way on the bottom that stays alive at 45°C tells us something about C. auris because it is theorized that it also comes from a marsh environment. In those areas, there are high temperature and high salinity, which can add it’s resilience. The paper gives some more details on C. auris:

C. aurisis an ascomycetous yeast and a close relative of the Candida haemulonii species complex, which includes species occasionally pathogenic in humans and animals and demonstrates a high level of baseline antifungal drug resistance. This phylogenetic connection may explain its low susceptibility to antifungal agents and the possession of virulence attributes that confer it with pathogenic potential.

They also note that because the first case of C. auris came from a human ear, that tells us that it may be in a transition period to being able to live inside our bodies and that its “thermotolerance” is newly acquired. The outside of our body is cooler than the inside and so, we may be on the cusp of this fungi’s thermal adaption to be able to fully survive inside of us, as other candida strains are able to.

So you can see it for yourself, here is where the reserachers make the formal proposal that “Candida auris is the first example of a pathogenic fungus emerging from human-induced global warming:”

With this background, we propose the hypothesis that Candida auris is the first example of a new pathogenic fungus emerging from human-induced global warming. We posit that prior to its recognition as a human pathogen, C. auris was an environmental fungus. The fact that C. auris fails to grow anaerobically, along with the fact that it is typically detected on cooler skin sites but not in the gut, supports the notion that C. auris was an environmental fungus, until recently…

Candida albicans is a different strain of Candida that is drug-resistant and pathogenic to humans and is typically found in the stomach. It is moves through the human body, some is being released by humans through our sewer systems which empty into wetlands and marshes. The marshes are serving as natural reservoirs of C. albicans . Fungi have a powerful evolutionary mechanism that gives them the ability to transfer DNA through plasmid transfer to help out nearby strains. A DNA analsysis for C. auris showed that it had the same virulence attributes of the human pathogenic strain C. albicans , even though it doesn’t share 99.5% of the rest of its genome. Again, C. auris is completely different from the C. alibcans with the “probability that these species belong to the same species or same subspecies [being] 0 as indicated by logistic regression of DNA-DNA hybridization.”

So the danger is that in the wild, various fungi can share the genetic material that provides fungicidal resistance. As the study on plasmid transfers between yeasts states in its conclusion, we aren’t even sure how they do this:

Although sexual activity between C. glabrata and S. cerevisiae cells has not been observed previously, we observed a relatively high frequency of transfer of genetic material between these yeast species. The mechanism(s) for this transfer is not clear… The transfer observed could allow the spread of virulence factors and resistance to medical drugs even between distantly related yeast species and could probably help in the “transformation” of harmless saprophytes into potential causative agents of human infections.

So basically, fungi have methods to transfer genetic material between themselves and so other types of fungi that are resistant to our drugs. When those fungi survive and make it through our sewer systems, they can then transfer those newly acquired abilities of resistance to the fungi that have been evolving thermal tolerance and structural resiliency to the salinity in marshes, basically becoming breeding pools of superfungi .

In the past, isolated fungi superpathogens adapted to warmth may never have made it to human populations, but due to our food processes, specifically the farming and the proximity to birds, we may have given C. auris a vector to transfer to us.

Here is an overview of a proposed process, followed by a graphic summarizing how the researchers suggest the spread of C. auris is connected to global warming and to our global food supply:

As a first step, its emergence might have been linked to global warming (including climatic oscillations) effects on wetlands, and its enrichment in that ecological niche was the result of C. auris’s combined thermal tolerance and salinity tolerance. . Alternatively, the effect of higher UV radiation in combination with global warming might have contributed to mutagenic events that resulted in the suddenly increased fitness of a saprobe for survival in a host, via melanin- or non-melanin-dependent processes. C. auris’s jump from an environmental fungus to a fungus capable of transmission to , and pathogenic for, humans might have had an intermediate host, specifically an avian host, as fungi that can grow at 40 or 42°C can infect avian fauna. Of note, sea birds may serve as reservoirs for indirect transmission of drug-resistant Candida species, such as C. glabrata , to humans. The uncanny ability of C auris to adapt to specific niches, first in the environmentand then in an avian host, might have led as a third step to its ultimate establishmentas a human pathogen through genetic and epigenetic switches

The paper proposes an example of a possible pathway that C. auris followed to make it to humans:

The paper ends with a summary of the issue, that due to the thermal tolerance of fungi increasing as well as human expansion into more of the planet and global interactions, we may see the emergence of many more pathogenic fungi throughout the 21st cenutry :

If anything, the direct and indirect effects of climate changes induced by an exponentially growing human population as drivers of fungal evolution should be an area of intense research in the decades to come. Widening of the geographic range of innately thermotolerant pathogenic fungi and the acquisition of virulence traits in thermotolerant nonpathogenic environmental fungi may shape the 21st century as an era of expanding fungal disease for both the fauna and flora of the planet.

A previous paper from 2010 by the main author from above and Monica Garcia-Solache, titled “Global Warming Will Bring New Fungal Diseases for Mammals” lays out the issue more directly, pointing to the concept that each 1 degree of warming reduces our thermal gradient by 5%:

Global warming means narrowing of the thermal gradient between ambient and mammalian temperatures. The current gradient is approximately 22°C, and consequently, every degree increase in the global average temperature reduces the gradient by about 5%. We hypothesize that with current global warming, the prevalence of fungal diseases will increase by the mechanisms previously discussed. As thermotolerance is more commonly found within the basidiomycetes, this group may be the major contributor of new fungal pathogens.

The red line in the above graph shows our body temperature, 37°C, which does not easily change except during fevers. Yet the planet is getting warmer and warmer, eroding our ~22°C thermal gradient. As compared with the time period from 20,000-6,500 years before now, from 1941 to 2009, the planet is warming more than 17 times faster! As humans, we are not going to evolve higher basal temperatures anytime soon, so as the planet warms we are going to be at more and more risk of pathogenic fungi by that closing of the thermal gradient.

Who would have thought that increasing temperatures alone would make us more susceptible to fungal infection? Prior to reading the articles this post is based on, I had never even heard of this as a risk to humanity. But as we increase the temperature, we are seriously increasing our chances for all sorts of devastating risks we may not even be aware of yet. Regarding the fungi evolving pathogenic properties and thermotolerance, the even scarier part is that we do not have many antifungals drugs available. And we especially do not have many antifungals that can work against resistant strains like C. auris:

The risk from newly emerged fungal pathogens could be magnified by the fact that there are few antifungal drugs available and no licensed vaccines. An increased emphasis on developing vaccines with efficacy against broad fungal classes could help ameliorate new threats from the environment.

Basically, we have no real tools to fight these fungi once they evolve, so the best thing we can do right now is work to keep the temperature of the planet down to stop their further evolution. This is not my personal alarmism (although I am personally alarmed), the scientists themselves are saying it: “This information could…add urgency to ongoing efforts to slow global warming.” If every other reason wasn’t enough to slow global warming, you can now add drug-resistant pathogenic fungi to the list of top concerns.

The medical establishment does not currently have any solution to stopping Candida auris , and from everything I gleaned in reading every study linked in this article and reading between the lines of those, there are no solutions coming soon. Our abilities in this area are pretty pathetic. In fact, we have barely even developed the technology and techniques to identify C. auris in the first place, so I doubt we will have any real solutions to stop it once it spreads…

The threat from C. auris reminds us why EVERY DEGREE OF WARMING MATTERS! The next time someone tries to belittles the difference between a 3°C vs 1.5°C warmer planet, you now have a new statistic in your arsenal: We will lose 15% vs 7.5% of our protection against invasive and deadly fungal pathogens. With the increasing spread of C. auris , just as I knew when I saw the NYT series on it that that would not be the last I heard of C. auris , this will not be the last time you hear of it either.

What can you do?

Reach out to your elected representatives and let them know that we really are in a climate emergency and that these kinds of unknown unknowns can pose a danger to society from even slightly increased temperatures. Tell them how scared you are (or at least about how scared I am).

Don’t vote for politicians who don’t take a strong stance on stopping climate change AND reversing it with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques. We are on target to shoot past of 1.5°C carbon budget, so CDR may be our only hope at this point to slow and potentially reverse the warming of the planet, thereby stopping the further evolution of thermally adapted funga pathogens.

adapted funga pathogens. Spread awareness of the lesser-known side-effects of climate change and why EVERY DEGREE OF WARMING MATTERS!

If you are in the medical field, please work on developing anti-fungal vaccines. If you are in the federal government or a funding agency, please provide funding for said antifungal vaccine development, as well as new anti-fungal drugs, because as of now we have no way to stop the spread of C. auris , and it is real.

As of July 12th, 2019, the CDC has identified 715 cases of C. auris infections in the United States.

Not only does he see growing odds of a double-dip recession, the Yale University senior fellow believes his ""seemingly crazed idea"" that the dollar would crash shouldn't be so crazy anymore.

""We've got data that's confirmed both the saving and current account dynamic in a much more dramatic fashion than even I was looking for,"" Roach told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Wednesday.

Roach highlights two ominous second quarter figures.

""The current account deficit in the United States, which is the broadest measure of our international imbalance with the rest of the world, suffered a record deterioration in the second quarter,"" he said. ""The so-called net-national savings rate, which is the sum of savings of individuals, businesses and the government sector, also recorded a record decline in the second quarter going back into negative territory for the first time since the global financial crisis.""

Right now, the U.S. Dollar Index is trading around 94. When Roach predicted on ""Trading Nation"" last June the index would plunge 35%, it was trading around 96."
"'Hundreds of thousands, if not millions': New Mexico sees massive migratory bird deaths",https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2020/09/12/mass-deaths-migratory-birds-new-mexico-environment/5780282002/,"'Hundreds of thousands, if not millions': New Mexico sees massive migratory bird deaths

Algernon D'Ammassa | Las Cruces Sun-News

Show Caption Hide Caption Endangered condors missing after California wildfire A California wildfire has destroyed a sanctuary for endangered California condors in the Big Sur mountains and the fates of more than a dozen of the giant birds is unknown. (Aug. 27)

LAS CRUCES - Biologists from New Mexico State University and White Sands Missile Range examined nearly 300 dead migratory birds Saturday at Knox Hall on the university's main campus.

Over the past few weeks, various species of migratory birds are dying in ""unprecedented"" numbers of unknown causes, reported Martha Desmond, a professor at NMSU's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology.

""It is terribly frightening,"" Desmond said. ""We've never seen anything like this. ... We're losing probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of migratory birds.""

In August, large numbers of birds were found dead at White Sands Missile Range and at the White Sands National Monument in what was thought to be an isolated incident, Desmond said.

For statewide and local reporting, subscribe to the Las Cruces Sun-News today.

After that, however, came reports of birds behaving strangely and dying in numerous locations in Doña Ana County, Jemez Pueblo, Roswell, Socorro and other locations statewide.

The affected birds have included warblers, sparrows, swallows, blackbirds, flycatchers, and the western wood pewee.

""A number of these species are already in trouble,"" Desmond said. ""They are already experiencing huge population declines and then to have a traumatic event like this is – it's devastating.""

On Saturday, Desmond was joined by Trish Cutler, a wildlife biologist at WSMR, and two NMSU students for an initial evaluation of the carcasses.

Desmond said her team also began catching and evaluating living specimens on Friday as residents find birds behaving strangely and gathering in large groups before dying.

""People have been reporting that the birds look sleepy ... they're just really lethargic,"" Cutler said. ""One thing we're not seeing is our resident birds mixed in with these dead birds. We have resident birds that live here, some of them migrate and some of them don't, but we're not getting birds like roadrunners or quail or doves.""

On the other hand, numerous migratory species are dying rapidly and it is not immediately clear why, although the cause appears to be recent. Desmond said the birds had moulted, replacing their feathers in preparation for their flight south, ""and you have to be healthy to do that; but somewhere after that, as they initiated their migratory route, they got in trouble.""

The biologists guessed the cause might involve the wildfires ravaging the western U.S. and dry conditions in New Mexico.

""They may have been pushed out before they were ready to migrate,"" Desmond said. ""They have to put on a certain amount of fat for them to be able to survive the migration. These birds migrate at night and they get up in the jet stream, and they might migrate for three nights in succession, they'll come down and they'll feed like crazy, put on more fat and go again.""

The biologists noted that the majority of the dying birds are insectivores, but that seed eaters were sickening and dying as well.

The birds will be sent to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Ore. for further analysis. Desmond it could be weeks before results come back, and the findings could bear serious ecological implications.

""Over 3 billion birds have died since 1970. Insect populations are crashing, and this is just an unprecedented mortality,"" she said. ""Climate change is affecting the abundance of insects, it's affecting the volatility of the fires, and the scary thing is this may be an indication of the future.""

There is simply no feasible path toward the re-stabilization of the climate that is consistent with the maintenance of capitalism’s main pillars.,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-trump-and-mnuchin-understand-climate-change-denial-is-the-only-authentic-defense-of-our-absurd-capitalist-ideology-2020-01-31?mod=mw_latestnews,"ATHENS, Greece (Project Syndicate) — Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, outraged liberal commentators at this year’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos with a snide remark directed at teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.

Responding to Thunberg’s call for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investments, Mnuchin said that she should go to college “to study economics” before “she can come back and explain that to us.” Two days earlier, Trump had referred to climate scientists as “the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers.”

“ Uncouth and disagreeable, Trumpism is nonetheless an honest manifestation of the historic moment when late capitalism pushed humanity past the point of no return. ”

The Trump administration’s attitude to climate change, and those campaigning for drastic measures to contain it, is ugly, nasty, and wrong.

But behind the crassness and toxicity of Trump, Mnuchin, et al. is cold logic and brutal honesty: Their politics is the only authentic defense of contemporary capitalism. And, judging by Mnuchin’s patronizing advice to Thunberg, they understand that mainstream economics, unlike climate science, is their friend.

I, too, could not contain myself after Mnuchin’s Davos remark. I tweeted this:

(“If Greta were to study mainstream economics, she would spend several semesters studying models of markets in which neither a climate disaster nor an economic crisis is possible. Time to transform both economic policy AND economics!”)

Many fellow economists were unhappy with my tweet. One tweeted back: “Not sure which undergrad programs you’re looking at but all the Econ 101 courses that I know of involve market failures, where climate change is the main example.”

Crush her spirit

Quite right. But it is, I fear, beside the point. While many examples and concepts in economics courses would no doubt strengthen Thunberg’s resolve and arm her with powerful arguments against the likes of Mnuchin and Trump, she would also feel frustrated and ultimately undermined by economics and its effect on her fellow students.

One reason is the discipline’s framing and default settings.

We all know the power of the default or baseline. In societies where organ donation is the default setting — automatic without a signed opt-out — the supply of transplant organs is substantially larger than in countries where people must carry donor cards. Framing is crucial in every setting where the human mind and heart must be energized against some ill.

“ The economic system we actually live in turns on a pathological dynamic mechanism: Oligopolies extract exhaustible value from humans and nature at breakneck speed, financed by debt-turbocharged financialization, which in turn fuels the extractive oligopolies. ”

Economics is no exception. The economic textbooks Thunberg would have to read begin with models of markets where the unfettered private profit drive is shown mathematically to serve the public interest.

Only after she has learned these theorems, and has practiced the mental gymnastics needed to derive their mathematical proofs, will she be exposed to “exceptions” — for example, “externalities” of the production process, like climate-change-inducing pollution, which imposes costs not fully borne by the polluter.

The model isn’t real

The very framing of market failures as an “exception,” perhaps caused by some “externality,” is an immense propaganda victory for the Trumps and Mnuchins of this world.

Worse, unlike organ donation, for which any society can decide to reverse the framing by making donation the default, college economics professors cannot simply reverse the framing by teaching externalities and market failure as the general case and presenting perfectly competitive markets as exceptions.

The iconic theorems of economics cannot be proven in the presence of externalities. Alas, it is these proofs that impress students and the rest of society, especially those in power, and give economics professors their discursive hegemony within the social sciences, not to mention the lion’s share of public and private funding.

Viewed from this perspective, Mnuchin knowingly (or instinctively) delivered more than a sneering put down. Were Thunberg to take his advice, she would be weakened.

A degree in economics, rather than in science, politics, or history, would either crush her spirit or divert her from endeavors that could make her even more dangerous than she already is to the economic interests Trump represents.

Some lament the Trump administration’s animosity toward young people and scientists who speak common sense about a massive threat that we should confront through global cooperation.

Capitalism cannot be tweaked enough

But Trump and his cabal appear to understand something that their liberal detractors do not: One cannot acknowledge the perils of climate change, commit to doing whatever it takes to reverse it, and continue to think of capitalism as a natural system that can be tweaked to deliver shared, green prosperity.

Trump gets it: climate change is capitalism’s Waterloo. There is simply no feasible path toward the re-stabilization of the climate that is consistent with the maintenance of capitalism’s main pillars.

The system we live in, unlike the one implied by college economics textbooks, turns on a pathological dynamic recycling mechanism: Oligopolies extract exhaustible value from humans and nature at breakneck speed, financed by debt-turbocharged financialization, which in turn fuels the extractive oligopolies.

This “technostructure,” as John Kenneth Galbraith christened this mechanism in his 1967 book “The New Industrial State,” will never willingly accept the limits on physical growth and extraction necessary for containing climate change, because it could not survive.

With the political class utterly dependent on it for campaign financing, any cap, quota, or emissions trading scheme imposed by the government will prove cosmetic and, ultimately, impotent.

In the same way that economics students study market failures as exceptions to an otherwise well-functioning market system, centrist reformers undergo the Sisyphean task of imagining a reformed, green capitalism.

Uncouth and disagreeable, Trumpism is nonetheless an honest manifestation of the historic moment when late capitalism pushed humanity past the point of no return. Trump urges us to carry on, while Mnuchin suggests that Thunberg numb her soul with the opium of mainstream economics.

The only alternative to their policy of accelerated climate change, to the oil and finance curses that drive capitalism, is the wholesale disintegration of today’s technostructure. Do we have the stomach for it?"
Greenland's ice is melting at the rate scientists thought would be our worst-case scenario in 2070,https://www.businessinsider.com/greenland-ice-melting-is-2070-worst-case-2019-8,"Greenland is known for its glaciers, but in the past month, the island has shed ice and taken on fire.

Scientists didn't expect to see Greenland melt at this rate for another 50 years: By the last week of July, the melting had reached levels that climate models projected for 2070 in the most pessimistic scenario.

On August 1, Greenland's ice sheet lost 12.5 billions tons of ice, more than any day since researchers started recording ice loss in 1950, The Washington Post reported.

The dramatic melt suggests that Greenland's ice sheet is approaching a tipping point that could set it on an irreversible course towards disappearing entirely. If that happens, catastrophic sea-level rise would swallow coastal cities across the globe. As ice melt continues to outpace scientists' expectations, some fear that could happen more quickly than they thought.

55 billion tons of water in 5 days

The Arctic's melting season starts each year in June and ends in August, with peak melting in July. However, the scale of ice loss in Greenland this year was extraordinary. From July 30 to August 3, melting occurred across 90% of the continent's surface, dumping 55 billion tons of water over 5 days. That's enough to cover Florida in almost 5 inches of water.

The melting mirrored the record-breaking ice loss seen in 2012, when almost all of Greenland's ice sheet was exposed to melting for the first time in documented history. This year, the ice started to melt even earlier than in 2012 and three weeks earlier than average, CNN reported.

This extreme melting came during the hottest month ever recorded, as an intense heat wave washed over Europe then wafted over to Greenland. Low-elevation ice began to melt and form pools across the ice sheet, and those pools' dark colors absorbed more sunlight, which further melted the glacier around them and exposed more ice to hot air.

Similarly above-average melting was observed in Switzerland — glaciers there lost 800 million tons of ice during the heat waves of June and July. Alaska also saw record sea-ice melt in July.

All that melting exposes more permafrost: frozen soil that releases powerful greenhouse gases when it thaws. That's happening faster than scientists predicted. The release of those gases leads the planet to warm even more, which accelerates more ice melt.

Last month was an anomaly for Greenland, but it could be the new normal by 2070 if humans don't curb greenhouse-gas emissions, according to climate models simulated by Xavier Fettweis, a climate researcher at the University of Liège in Belgium.

""By mid to end of the century is when we should be seeing these melt levels — not right now,"" Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute, told Inside Climate News. ""[The models] are clearly not able to capture some of these important processes.""

Melting ice in Greenland raises sea levels

Greenland's ice melt has already raised sea levels more than 0.5 inches since 1972. Half of that occurred just in the last eight years, according to a study published in April.

Ice melt forms gushing white water in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland on August 1, 2019. Caspar Haarloev from ""Into the Ice"" documentary via Reuters

At this rate, the entire Greenland ice sheet could melt within 1,000 years, causing up to 23 feet of sea level rise.

But Mottram isn't so sure about that projected timeline.

""Somewhere between 1.5 and 2 degrees, there's a tipping point after which it will no longer be possible to maintain the Greenland Ice Sheet,"" she told Inside Climate News. ""What we don't have a handle on is how quickly the Greenland Ice Sheet will be lost.""

Greenland's ice is already approaching that tipping point, according to a study published in May. Whereas melting during warm cycles used to get balanced out by new ice forming during cool cycles, warm periods now cause significant meltdown and cool periods simply pause it.

That makes it difficult for the ice sheet to regenerate what it's losing.

Unprecedented fires have also burned across the Arctic

The warm, dry weather that caused the ice to melt also set the stage for wildfires in Greenland.

Satellites first detected a wildfire near Sisimiut area on July 10. Temperatures in the region at the time approached 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius); the normal daily high is 50 degrees (10 degrees Celsius).

The fires may have been started by a hiker using an outdoor oven.

This was the first fire of its size since another large one in the same area surprised scientists in August 2017. That fire blazed for two weeks.

Unprecedented wildfires also raged across the Arctic this summer, releasing 50 megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in June alone. That's the equivalent of Sweden's annual emissions, and more carbon than Arctic fires released during every month of July from 2010 to 2018 combined, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).

CAMS tracked over 100 ""intense and long-lived"" wildfires in the Arctic Circle over six weeks in June and July. Those fires spread farther, burned more intensely, and lasted longer than normal.

Fires in Alaska and Siberia also deposited soot on Greenland's ice sheet, which darkened the surface and caused it to absorb more heat, which leads to faster melting.

""It is unusual to see fires of this scale and duration at such high latitudes in June,"" Mark Parrington, a CAMS wildfire expert, said in a release. ""But temperatures in the Arctic have been increasing at a much faster rate than the global average, and warmer conditions encourage fires to grow and persist once they have been ignited.""

Arctic regions are especially sensitive to climate change

The Arctic is warming almost twice as quickly as the global average.

On the other end of the globe, Antarctica's melt is also accelerating. The continent has lost 252 billion tons of ice per year in the last decade. That's just a hair behind Greenland, which is losing an average 286 billion tons per year.

Together, Greenland and Antarctica hold more than 99% of the world's fresh water in their ice sheets, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. If both were to melt entirely, the state of Florida would disappear.

According to a map from National Geographic, cities like Amsterdam, Netherlands; Stockholm, Sweden; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dakar, Senegal; and Cancun, Mexico (to name just a few) would also vanish."
Temperatures in Scandinavia are 30 Degrees Above Normal for This Time of Year as Heat from the Sahara Surges Towards the Norh Pole in Mid-winter,https://www.severe-weather.eu/mcd/strong-warm-advection-northern-europe-mk/?fbclid=IwAR288s9HKPOqSdY1ExDhwtJXdnlL3gSSJFbgoiNmv2yul2CxrmAFXsuQIY4,"The dynamic pattern over North Atlantic lately is also pushing waves towards northern Europe, while extensive upper-level ridging is persisting over the rest of continental Europe. This weekend, strong westerlies brought a very strong warm advection into Scandinavia and temperatures warmed up for 20-30 °C in many areas compared to the past days!

Temperatures this afternoon compared to yesterday morning, Dec 29th vs 27th – notice parts of Lapland is almost 30 °C warmer compared to yesterday morning!

A powerful upper-level ridging is maintaining across much of Europe, centered over western Europe. Along its eastern flank, a large upper low is resulting in unsettled weather conditions and cold advection into SE parts of Europe and the Balkans. While on the northern part of the ridge, a short-wave is moving across northern Scandinavia. An extremely warm airmass is advection ahead of the surface low over the Norwegian sea, spreading into Scandinavia and towards the Baltic region.

A very warm air mass is spread across much of Scandinavia, being 10-15 °C warmer than normal of the end of December.



Most of Scandinavia will experience well above 0 °C temperatures for another 36 hours, so there goes the winter fairytale. Parts of Sweden and western Finland could even experience around +8 °C tomorrow morning!

Another effect of such pattern is strong westerly flow along the northern flank of the ridge, advecting moist airmass into mountains of WSW Norway and resulting in a persisting strong orographic precipitation. Most of it will be excessive rainfall, while snowfall will be limited to the highest elevations only. Locally 250-400 mm is likely by Thursday.

However, much colder airmass returns soon, at least across Lapland, when a strong cold advection spreads in the wake of the wave ejecting on Tuesday.

There is a deep institutional systemic bias towards aligning academics' conclusions within the boundaries of the status quo.

He is outspoken in saying that the scientific community has much to do to change its ways.

This article first appeared in Responsible Science Issue No. 2, 2020

Andrew Simms: Would you like to hear more from your fellow climate scientists now about the speed and scale of action required?

Prof Kevin Anderson: I’d like to hear much more of what many academics say in private being said in public. This is also true of many others I engage with across the climate change community – from those in NGOs to more informed policy makers, business types, journalists, and more. Over the past two or more decades I’ve witnessed an emerging preference for spinning an appealing but increasingly misleading yarn about what is needed to meet our various climate commitments. Disturbingly, many of those who should know better have even begun to believe their own delusionary tales. The enthusiastic and almost unquestioning support by many academics for the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC UK) ‘net zero’ report, or ‘not zero’ as I prefer to call it, exemplifies how we’re prepared to forgo analysis and integrity to maintain politically-palatable fairy-tales of delivering on Paris.

AS: And what are they saying in private?

KA: Not all, but many had been telling me for years that there’s no hope of staying below 2 degrees centigrade, that we’re heading to three or four degrees. I should add that I disagreed with this view, arguing that if we’re lucky on climate sensitivity and are prepared to grasp the nettle and make very difficult but doable cuts in emissions, then a thin thread of hope remained for staying below two degrees. Today, the chances are much, much slimmer and with the cuts in emissions completely unprecedented and far beyond anything in the public and political debate. What I find most disturbing, is that many of those who previously had told me, away from any microphones, that 2°C was not viable, are now coming out in support of meeting 1.5°C. Worse still, they repeatedly point to idealised technical solutions, yet often with little understanding of either the technologies or their practical delivery, let alone the timelines for making wholesale shifts in technologies and associated infrastructures.

Typically it is more senior academics and others who hold these conflicting public and private positions. Whilst such deception is often very well meant, it nevertheless reflects a deep arrogance. They are basically saying, I’m a sufficiently clever person, that I can judge what is politically or not viable, and therefore by massaging my assumptions I can provide politically appropriate conclusions. Such arrogance is widespread. Just look at the CCC UK. I have a huge respect for the CCC’s secretariat, and particularly the new CEO, Chris Stark, I think he’s excellent. But since its inception, the academic Commissioners who, in many respects guide the framing of the secretariat’s work, have failed to support the CCC in pursuing genuinely independent analysis.

As such the CCC have, in my view, misled parliament and the public – at least in terms of mitigation. Individually I respect the academic work of many of the commissioners, some of whom I know well and would call friends, but as soon as they don their CCC hat, academic rigour is weakened in favour of political expediency. Exacerbating all of this is repeated reference to the CCC as independent. It is not. It is basically a Quango with advisors and a secretariat more sensitive to the dominant political and economic dogma than to the implications of their science.

As I say, all this is done with good intention – and perhaps if the rest of the academic community held the CCC, and government ministers, to account, this would not be a problem. But by and large the academic community, including the funders, have abdicated this responsibility preferring to embrace the CCC as the climate oracle. I want to add here, that I have spoken to Chris Stark about this, and think it only fair to note that he strongly disagrees with my views on how the Commissioners have engaged with the secretariat – seeing their contribution in a much more constructive light.

AS: Does that mean that in effect, they’ve been self-editing, or self-censoring, in terms of not saying what is necessary to align the process of economic and political change to meet the Paris targets?

KA: I think that’s true of the CCC, and I think it’s true of a high proportion of academic work on mitigation, particularly at a senior level. Unfortunately, this invidious political expediency percolates down to some of the earlier career researchers. However, from experience, the Post Docs and the PhDs demonstrate much greater integrity with their research, and an honest recognition of the scale of the challenge we face.

I’ve only really become aware of the misleading and dangerous influence of some senior academics on their earlier career colleagues over the past two years. It was brought to my attention at one of the big climate negotiations, (COPs) I was attending. Chatting to those without grey hair, it became increasingly clear many of them were being reprimanded for asking difficult questions by their senior colleagues and supervisors. I really found this hard to believe. But the more I asked about this the more I realised I’d been living in a naïve bubble unaware of how vibrant academic debate driven by younger academic colleagues is being deliberately stifled. And this is not something that only others elsewhere are doing. I now hear that senior colleagues I’ve worked with & known for years – sharing many a vibrant exchange over coffee or a beer with some of them – have also actively constrained the contributions of ‘their’ earlier career colleagues.

I assumed most good academics thrived on open debate and courteous but robust disagreement – Ok, put on a CCC hat, do some consultancy work etc, and there’s a risk of all too easily being co-opted. But this is much worse. It’s a deep institutional systemic bias towards aligning our conclusions within the boundaries of the status quo – and this extends to the funders. We’ve chosen to forgo our academic independence for the appeal of being relevant within a debate our own analysis tells us is irrelevant.

It’s only then when a Swedish child has the courage to call out our nakedness, echoed by a similar call from our own children, that we stir from our cosy consensus. Forced to look in the mirror – it’s becoming bloody obvious that we’re naked and have been for a long time, but no one has had the guts to tell us. The wonderful thing about children is that they’re not yet locked into our political baggage – but if they go on to become post-docs, we’ll do our best to bash them into conformity.

AS: Do you think it would have been easier to bring forward political and policy proposals that were in line with the scale of the problem if the scientific community had censored what they had said less?

KA: Well, first of all, I don’t think the scientific community should censor what it says at all. If it does censor, then it isn’t the scientific community. There’s a serious risk that we’ve become little more than a group of elite privileged citizens. With no expertise in processes of change in emergencies, or political economy more generally, we pontificate on responding to climate change, hiding the ignorance underpinning our expedient suggestions behind a veil of academic objectivity.

I take a straightforward view of our role as academics. We need to develop a culture of being disinterested in whether people like or dislike our work, our only interest should be in whether people agree or disagree with our analysis and conclusions – and why. Academia should not be a fashion contest, or a desperate clamour for funding, committee memberships, gongs, awards and prestige.

As for whether honesty, integrity and robust bluntness would have significantly changed where we are now, – well in my judgement, yes and significantly so. I can understand the levels of measured optimism of the early 1990s; that substantial but nonetheless incremental changes to business as usual could have led to a timely decarbonised future. But by 2000 it was becoming obvious that such optimism was now misplaced. Rising emissions & more locked-in fossil fuel infrastructure and associated expectations, had kicked the potential of incrementalism into the long grass. During the subsequent two decades, the academic and climate change community has not played a straight bat when it comes to mitigation. As the years have passed, through 2005, 2010, and onto 2015 and Paris, we’ve adopted increasingly exotic technologies, technocratic fraud, dodgy accounting and eloquent nonsense as a salve for ever-rising emissions. There is no group that can be singled out for this abject failure. Certainly the academic community learnt credibility to the fluff and nonsense that has filled the void left by failing to mitigate. But the journalists have played their role – more spin and glossy stories than investigative reporting. The policy makers, the business community, the unions, civil service and the electorate, at least in democracies, don’t come out of this any better. And nor do the climate great and good – from Gore to DiCaprio, Attenborough to Goodall, Musk to Branson – all have been party to a greening of business as usual. On mitigation and particularly cutting emissions in line with Paris, we’re all players in a grand unifying delusion – we’ve become mitigation-deniers.

If, on mitigation (as distinct from the science), academics had collectively favoured meticulous analysis, system thinking and blunt communication over spin & well-intentioned sycophancy, then I think we could have catalysed a different and more honest debate. Whether this would have led to the profound changes to contemporary society now required by Paris cannot be known. But rigorous academic input was and still is a prerequisite of transforming the thinking, expectations, policies, and societal norms inline with 2°C carbon budgets. Of course, such input is not sufficient, but without it we will continue to fail.

"Canada, a territory that has 0.5% of the Earth’s population plans to use up nearly a third of the planet’s remaining carbon budget",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/when-it-comes-to-climate-hypocrisy-canadas-leaders-have-reached-a-new-low,"Americans elected Donald Trump, who insisted climate change was a hoax – so it’s no surprise that since taking office he’s been all-in for the fossil fuel industry. There’s no sense despairing; the energy is better spent fighting to remove him from office.

Canada, on the other hand, elected a government that believes the climate crisis is real and dangerous – and with good reason, since the nation’s Arctic territories give it a front-row seat to the fastest warming on Earth. Yet the country’s leaders seem likely in the next few weeks to approve a vast new tar sands mine which will pour carbon into the atmosphere through the 2060s. They know – yet they can’t bring themselves to act on the knowledge. Now that is cause for despair.

The Teck mine would be the biggest tar sands mine yet: 113 square miles of petroleum mining, located just 16 miles from the border of Wood Buffalo national park. A federal panel approved the mine despite conceding that it would likely be harmful to the environment and to the land culture of Indigenous people. These giant tar sands mines (easily visible on Google Earth) are already among the biggest scars humans have ever carved on the planet’s surface. But Canadian authorities ruled that the mine was nonetheless in the “public interest”.

Here’s how Justin Trudeau, recently re-elected as Canada’s prime minister, put it in a speech to cheering Texas oilmen a couple of years ago: “No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there.” That is to say, Canada, which is 0.5% of the planet’s population, plans to use up nearly a third of the planet’s remaining carbon budget. Ottawa hides all this behind a series of pledges about “net-zero emissions by 2050” and so on, but they are empty promises. In the here-and-now they can’t rein themselves in. There’s oil in the ground and it must come out.

This is painfully hard to watch because it comes as the planet has supposedly reached a turning point. A series of remarkable young people (including Canadians such as Autumn Peltier) have captured the imagination of people around the world; scientists have issued ever sterner warnings; and the images of climate destruction show up in every newspaper. Canadians can see the Australian blazes on television; they should bring back memories of the devastating forest fires that forced the evacuation of Fort McMurray, in the heart of the tar sands complex, less than four years ago.

The only rational response would be to immediately stop the expansion of new fossil fuel projects. It’s true that we can’t get off oil and gas immediately; for the moment, oil wells continue to pump. But the Teck Frontier proposal is predicated on the idea that we’ll still need vast quantities of oil in 2066, when Greta Thunberg is about to hit retirement age. If an alcoholic assured you he was taking his condition very seriously, but also laying in a 40-year store of bourbon, you’d be entitled to doubt his sincerity, or at least to note his confusion. Oil has addled the Canadian ability to do basic math: more does not equal less, and 2066 is not any time soon. An emergency means you act now.

In fairness, Canada has company here. For every territory making a sincere effort to kick fossil fuels (California, Scotland) there are other capitals just as paralyzed as Ottawa. Australia’s fires creep ever closer to the seat of government in Canberra, yet the prime minister, Scott Morrison, can’t seem to imagine any future for his nation other than mining more coal. Australia and Canada are both rich nations, their people highly educated, but they seem unable to control the zombie momentum of fossil fuels.

There’s obviously something hideous about watching the Trumps and the Putins of the world gleefully shred our future. But it’s disturbing in a different way to watch leaders pretend to care – a kind of gaslighting that can reduce you to numb nihilism. Trudeau, for all his charms, doesn’t get to have it both ways: if you can’t bring yourself to stop a brand-new tar sands mine then you’re not a climate leader."
"Cattle have stopped breeding, koalas die of thirst: A vet's hellish diary of climate change",https://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/cattle-have-stopped-breeding-koalas-die-of-thirst-a-vet-s-hellish-diary-of-climate-change-20191220-p53m03.html,"They are all gone and it was all for nothing. The paddocks are bare, the dams dry, the grass crispy and brown. The whole region has been completely destocked and is devoid of life. Loading For 22 years, I have been the vet in this once-thriving town in northern NSW, which, as climate change continues to fuel extreme heat, drought and bushfires, has become hell on Earth. Here, we are seeing extreme weather events like never before. The other day we had about eight centimetres of rain in 20 minutes. These downpours are like rain bombs. They are so ferocious that a farmer lost all of his fences, and all it did was silt up the dam so he had to use a machine to excavate the mud. Most farmers in my district have not a blade of grass remaining on their properties. Topsoil has been blown away by the terrible, strong winds this spring and summer. We have experienced the hottest days that I can remember, and right now I can’t even open any windows because my eyes sting and lungs hurt from bushfire smoke.

For days, I have watched as the bushland around us went up like a tinderbox. I just waited for the next day when my clinic would be flooded with evacuated dogs, cats, goats and horses in desperate need of water and food. Loading The impact of the drought on wildlife is devastating to watch, too. Members of the public are bringing us koalas, sugar gliders, possums, galahs, cockatoos and kangaroos on a daily basis. The koalas affect me the most. To see these gorgeous, iconic animals dying from thirst is too hard to bear. We save some, but we lose just as many. The whole town is devastated. My business has halved. But with no horses to breed, no cattle to test and care for, what am I going to do? I have worked day and night to build a future for my family, but who would want to buy our property out here? Who would want to buy a vet clinic in a town where there are no animals to treat because it’s too hot and dry? Where the cattle become infertile from the 40-degree heat. All this on black, baked ground.

I am 53 years old. Can I start again? Climate change for us is every day, and I am not suffering on the same level as my friends, my clients and the helpless animals I treat. As a veterinarian I am becoming more and more distressed, not just about the state of my town, but the whole world. Bushfire smoke moves over Inverell. Personally, I have had weeks when I just cry. It just bloody hurts me. I also have times when I get really angry and I start to swear, which I have never done in my life. I also have times when I think about the potential this country has to create a renewable future with clean, green energy, and end our reliance on fossil fuels."
FBI Uncovers Al-Qaeda Plot To Just Sit Back And Enjoy Collapse Of United States,https://www.theonion.com/fbi-uncovers-al-qaeda-plot-to-just-sit-back-and-enjoy-c-1819576375,"A recent al-Qaeda video shows a militant training to carry out his mission of lying back and watching America’s status as a superpower erode

WASHINGTON—Putting the nation on alert against what it has described as a “highly credible terrorist threat,” the FBI announced today that it has uncovered a plot by members of al-Qaeda to sit back and enjoy themselves while the United States collapses of its own accord.

Multiple intelligence agencies confirmed that the militant Islamist organization and its numerous affiliates intend to carry out a massive, coordinated plan to stand aside and watch America’s increasingly rapid decline, with terrorist operatives across the globe reportedly mobilizing to take it easy, relax, and savor the spectacle as it unfolds.

“We have intercepted electronic communication indicating that al-Qaeda members are actively plotting to stay out of the way while America as we know it gradually crumbles under the weight of its own self-inflicted debt and disrepair,” FBI Deputy Director Mark F. Giuliano told the assembled press corps. “If this plan succeeds, it will leave behind a nation with a completely dysfunctional economy, collapsing infrastructure, and a catastrophic health crisis afflicting millions across the nation. We want to emphasize that this danger is very real.”

“And unfortunately, based on information we have from intelligence assets on the ground, this plot is already well under way,” he added.

A recently declassified CIA report confirmed that all known al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations—from Pakistan to Yemen, and from Somalia to Algeria—have been instructed to kick back and enjoy the show as the United States’ federal government, energy grid, and industrial sector are rendered impotent by internal dissent, decay, and mismanagement. According to statements made by top-level informants and corroborated by leading Western terrorism experts, if seen through to its conclusion, al-Qaeda’s current plot could wreak far more damage than the events of 9/11.

In the past year, money transfers to al-Qaeda cells around the world have reportedly been accompanied by instructions to use the funds to outfit safe houses with the proper equipment to receive American cable news broadcasts and view top U.S. news websites, allowing terrorists to fully relish each detail of the impending demise of the last global superpower.

Additionally, FBI officials made public an internal al-Qaeda video today in which the terrorist organization’s leader Ayman al-Zawahiri chillingly exhorts his followers to “take a load off” and “unwind” in the name of jihad, and really cherish the victory over their enemy.

“Praise Allah, for soon every American city shall be plagued with disaster and hardship,” al-Zawahiri said in the video, which includes several minutes of footage of young, masked al-Qaeda militants casually sipping beverages as they thumb through the latest issues of Time and U.S. News And World Report. “The infidels have brought this pain and destruction upon themselves through their arrogance and callousness. Soon, the United States will watch in horror as its bridges crumble, its desperate citizens suffer in want of medicine and paying employment, and its once vast riches are reduced to naught. The righteous warriors among our ranks must now unite, get comfortable, and look on from afar at the calamity unfolding in the West.”

“We vow that we will not cease sitting around and laughing it up until America is reduced to rubble,” he continued.

Al-Zawahiri, who is seen in the video reclining back in his chair, putting his feet up, and flipping on CNN, later shouts “Allahu Akbar!” when a story is aired about the decade-long trend of stagnant wages among American workers.

The FBI has also warned that numerous al-Qaeda agents may have established sleeper cells for the purpose of “getting a kick out of” the nation’s downfall on American soil. The bureau urged U.S. residents to use caution around schools, hospitals, legislative bodies, prisons, and other decaying institutions whose imminent failure terrorists may wish to observe up close.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one high-ranking U.S. counterterrorism official has described the present situation as a massive failure of intelligence.

“The warning signs were there all along, but unfortunately we failed to heed them,” said the official, who advised Americans to brace for widespread devastation. “If we’d listened to experts or even our own common sense, we would’ve realized that this plot was being actively orchestrated within our own borders. But we didn’t, and now every one of our citizens and our very way of life is at risk from this threat.”

“Sadly, al-Qaeda has us right where they want us,” the official added, “and at this point, I fear it is too late to do anything about it.”

Responding to the allegations, a spokesperson for al-Qaeda reportedly confirmed the terror group’s plot and praised the American people as martyrs of the highest order."
"Wealthy people booking private jets to escape coronavirus outbreak. The number of private jet flights from Hong Kong to Australia and North America in January jumped 214%, compared with in 2019.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/02/wealthy-private-jets-escape-coronavirus-outbreak,"This article is more than 7 months old

This article is more than 7 months old

Big businesses and wealthy people are chartering private jets for “evacuation flights” out of countries hit by the coronavirus outbreak.

Adam Twidell, the chief executive of the private jet booking service PrivateFly, said the company had been inundated with requests from multinational firms arranging the mass evacuation of staff from China and south-east Asia.

Twidell said rich families were also chartering private jets to reduce the risk of exposing their families to the virus by avoiding commercial flights and busy airports.

“Over the past few weeks, there’s undoubtedly been a rise in demand for short notice on-demand charter relating to the coronavirus Covid-19,” he said. “We’ve had a very significant number of inquiries for group evacuations and from corporates and individuals.

“Initially, inquiries were focused on evacuations from south-east Asia and other affected areas. But, increasingly, we are now seeing clients looking to take a private flight between a variety of global destinations, to avoid exposure to crowds in [commercial] cabins and airport terminals.

“In many cases, these are passengers who don’t usually fly by private aviation but are looking to protect themselves, their families and employees.”

Twidell said his firm arranged for a jet to transport a Hong Kong-based family to Bali because they were worried about “exposure on [a commercial] flight”.

He said it was just one example of a wealthy family who would usually use commercial flights choosing to book a private jet to reduce risk of the virus.

“Each aircraft is equipped with a protective healthcare and sanitary equipment kit for passengers and crew, should it be required,” Twidell said. “The health of crew members is being monitored very closely, including temperature checks before every flight.”

The charter flight company Victor was recently asked by a Hollywood film studio to fly about 50 people from Tokyo to Los Angeles, to limit their interaction with other travellers, according to Bloomberg.

"“If we do not ban whole classes of chemicals in the next 10 years, we will face a crash in the number of new births,” GMO co-founder Jeremy Grantham said in a letter. “The bottom line is this: either endocrine disrupting chemicals will go out of business or we will!”",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/gmos-grantham-warns-only-the-rich-will-be-able-to-have-kids-due-to-chemical-toxicity.html,"High-profile investor Jeremy Grantham warned in a letter that falling birth rates in the developed world could accelerate in coming years due to increasing chemical toxicity, allowing only wealthy people to have children.

In recent years, economists have raised concern about the impact on economic growth of slowing birth rates in the developed world. Grantham, who co-founded GMO in the 1970s and is famous for calling the last two major market bubbles, said that trend is poised to accelerate due to increased chemical toxicity in the environment and food products.

""This interference is growing at such a rapid rate that if left alone it is likely to leave us sterile in a few decades with only the rich able to easily afford the healthy lifestyles and the exotic medical help required to have babies,"" Grantham said.

While acknowledging that changes in lifestyle choices is responsible for at least some of the slowing birth rates, Graham said increased chemical toxicity is making it harder for women to conceive and lowering sperm counts in men.

""The net effect of choice and postponement combined with the recent decade of 'help' from toxicity has been an unexpected and accelerating decline in delivered fertility in developed countries, as well as the critically important China and India, with new annual cohorts of babies already declining in absolute numbers, not just growth rates,"" Grantham said."
"CDC whistleblower says he was told not to use phrase ""climate change"" after Trump elected",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-whistleblower-dr-george-luber-says-agency-backed-away-from-using-phrase-climate-change/,"There's a new government whistleblower targeting the Trump administration, this time at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A top scientist there, who was its public face of climate science and its effects on diseases, tells CBS News the agency backed away from its fight against climate change, including even using the phrase ""climate change,"" over fears of antagonizing the administration.

The whistleblower is Dr. George Luber, who worked at the CDC for 17 years, and was the head of its climate and health program until last year, when he was reassigned.

Luber was such a celebrated scientist, he hung out with stars like Matt Damon, and was featured in a Showtime special talking about rising temperatures, called ""Years of Living Dangerously."" ""It's a small field but I am one of the world's experts,"" Dr. Luber said.

Dr. George Luber, who was head of the CDC's climate and health program. CBS News

In late 2016 Luber was organizing a climate change conference. Al Gore was to be the keynote speaker. But right after Donald Trump was elected president, Luber's boss called him in.

Luber recalled, ""I was told the optics are not good and that I needed to cancel it.""

Correspondent Mark Strassmann asked, ""Did he explain what the optics issue was?""

""That the meeting was happening three weeks after the inauguration.""

""And that the White House would be unhappy?""

""Yeah,"" Dr. Luber said.

America's new president had a dim view of Luber's science, referring to climate change as a hoax, ""created by and for the Chinese.""

Dr. Luber said his boss wanted something else: ""Just don't say 'climate change.' Can you call it 'extreme weather?' Can you call it something else?""

Strassmann said, ""You're saying that the Centers for Disease Control was suddenly afraid to use the term 'climate change'?""

""Yeah. Absolutely. I was told to use a different term,"" he said.

In March 2018 the CDC revoked Dr. Luber's badge, phone and credentials. He was escorted off the property. The CDC moved to fire him. He faced more than 30 ""troubling allegations,"" from falsifying timecards to seeming hung over. Dr. Luber refuted all but one charge, and was allowed to stay.

But, he says, the CDC dismantled his climate and health program, which the agency denies.

""The program has not changed, the program is the same. It was just placed in a different administrative unit,"" said Dr. Patrick Breysse, Dr. Luber's boss at the CDC. He's the senior manager who Dr. Luber said ordered him to scuttle the science conference.

""It wasn't cancelled; we postponed it,"" Dr. Breysse said.

""You didn't feel any pressure at all?"" Strassmann asked.

""No.""

""Politically?""

""No.""

That conference happened, but without CDC sponsorship.

Strassmann asked, ""Were any CDC employees ever told, 'Stop using the phrase ""climate change""'?""

""Not to my knowledge,"" Dr. Breysse replied, ""but we did discuss it.""

""That you change from 'climate change' to 'extreme weather,' because 'climate change' was more radioactive?""

""We talked about making the change, but we never made the change.""

What's unchanged, Dr. Breysse insists, is the CDC's commitment to studying climate science, but without its star, George Luber. Strassmann asked Dr. Breysse why.

""I can't talk about personnel matters, I'm sorry, Mark,"" he responded.

""Has he been banned from the campus?""

""So, that's a personnel matter that I can't discuss.""

""Is the CDC retaliating against him?""

""I'm just not going to comment on that,"" he said.

Dr. Luber still works at the CDC, but potentially faces up to a four-month suspension. He has to work from home, where he reviews scientific papers unrelated to climate change.

He told Strassmann, ""I do not want media attention, I never did with this. Let me do my work.""

Dr. Luber's whistleblower complaint is still under review. It also alleges Congress allocated $10 million for climate change research and the CDC illegally spent it elsewhere.

The CDC denies that."

The Soviet Union collapsed overnight. Don’t assume western democracy will last for ever.,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/05/soviet-union-collapsed-overnight-western-democracy-liberal-order-ussr-russia,"Below the medieval citadel in Kazan, two vast frozen rivers turn the landscape white. On a Saturday afternoon there are a few hardy locals shuffling through the icy sludge to take selfies against the mosque, the Christmas lights and the Soviet-era statues.

It’s 25 years since I was last in Russia, trying and failing to revive the left during the chaotic first days of Boris Yeltsin’s economic reforms. Half a lifetime later I am here to address a room full of people who want to talk about replacing capitalism with something better – and suddenly we have something in common: now we both know what it’s like to see a system that once looked permanent collapsing.

Since I’ve been here, almost everyone who has chosen to come and hear me is involved in either contemporary arts or philosophy. The journalists who want to interview me – a public critic of Putin’s policy in Syria and Ukraine – mainly write for cultural magazines. These, if not exactly the new rock’n’roll, are the safest intellectual spaces in which critical thought can take place.

Since Putin stole the 2011 election, and the subsequent protest movement was suppressed, the young people who took part in it have retreated into an angry silence. It’s not exactly a new situation for Russian intellectuals. Lenin was arrested here in 1887 for leading a student protest and spent most of the next 30 years in exile or underground. Then the Bolsheviks suppressed free speech and political opposition for another 70 years and Russia’s capitalist oligarchs are doing their best to suppress it now.

In the face of this, why do Russian artists, philosophers and journalists persist in their belief in change? In short, because they have seen the moral and physical collapse of something that once seemed permanent: the Soviet Union.

Alexei Yurchak, an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, decribes the event in a book whose title speaks for itself: Everything Was Forever Until It Was No More. Yurchak was fascinated by the fact that, while nobody predicted the fall, when it happened, many people realised that they had, in their hearts, expected it all along.

During the era of perestroika, under Gorbachev, many people experienced a sudden “break in consciousness”, as realisation dawned that the fall was imminent. But until then most people behaved, spoke and even thought as if the Soviet system was permanent. And despite their cynicism about its brutality, they went on parades, participated in meetings and performed the rituals demanded by the state.

Since Trump’s victory in November 2016, it has become possible to believe a similar collapse will happen in the west, to globalisation and liberal values.

The parallels are obvious. We too have lived for 30 years under an economic system that proclaimed its own permanence. Globalisation was an unstoppable natural process; free-market economics simply the natural state of things.

But when the country that designed globalisation, imposed it and benefited from it most votes against it, you have to consider the possibility that it is going to end, and suddenly. If so, you also have to consider a possibility that – if you are a liberal, humanist democrat – may be even more shocking: that oligarchic nationalism is the default form of failing economies.

When Yeltsin unleashed penury and collapse in the early 90s, I witnessed Russian society descend into chaos. We held our meetings in the abandoned facilities of Stalinist academia, amid discarded Soviet text books, busts of Lenin, minutes of central committees that no longer existed. There was violence on the streets and larceny in the boardrooms of Russia’s resource monopolies, where ownership fell to whichever kleptokrat could exert the most force.

Compared with the chaos of the 1990s, Putinism has felt like a redemption. Putin has, at the cost of diplomatic isolation and the suppression of democratic rights, restored growth, order and national pride. Now all over the world there are mini-Putins: the Hungarian PM, Viktor Orbán; the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan; the would-be French fascist president, Marine Le Pen. If – as they desire – the west descends into economic nationalism, everybody under the age of 50 will go through the same kind of ideological shock the Russians went through in the late 80s.

In economics, political science and the study of international relations there has been, for about three decades, a general assumption that the current framework is permanent. Just as in Soviet academia, if globalisation turns out to have been just a temporary and reversible thing, textbooks once revered will have to lie abandoned.

But there’s one big difference. The dissidents of the late Soviet era fought for democracy and human rights under the general concept of “the west”. For us, if xenophobic populism triumphs, there will be no “west” to aspire to: if liberal, democratic societies begin to go the way of Orbán’s Hungary, there will be no external power to help us.

Our last great hope will be ourselves. And there are enough of us to stop this second great collapse towards oligarchy and nationalism. We are networked, aware, educated and – for now – psychologically resilient. As we link together and resist we can learn a lot from those who have been doing it, quietly, in Russia.

The young generation of Putin’s critics may wear an overcoat of cynicism, weariness and abstraction, but they possess a diamond-hard belief in change."
The government shutdown spotlights a bigger issue: 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html,"The partial government shutdown, which began Dec. 22, has now stretched well into the new year. President Donald Trump said Friday that it would continue for ""months or even years"" until he receives the requested $5 billion in funding for a border wall. The shutdown has left approximately 800,000 federal workers in financial limbo. Around 420,000 ""essential"" employees are working without pay, while another 380,000 have been ordered to stay home, according to calculations provided to CNBC by Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University. In some cases, the furloughs have forced government employees to tap into their savings, rely on credit cards or crowdsource funds to make ends meet.

Government workers are far from alone in feeling stressed about not getting paid. Nearly 80 percent of American workers (78 percent) say they're living paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2017 report by employment website CareerBuilder. Women are particularly vulnerable: 81 percent of them report living paycheck to paycheck, compared with 75 percent of men. Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, tells CNBC that the group has heard from hundreds of frantic federal employees. ""They're scared,"" he says. ""They don't know how they're going to put food on the table."" Various #ShutdownStories making that point have gone viral on Twitter. Tweet 1 Tweet 2 Tweet 3 It's not merely those earning low wages who are struggling. CareerBuilder reports that nearly 10 percent of Americans with salaries of $100,000 or more live paycheck to paycheck as well. That means that many workers aren't able to put anything significant into savings. More than 50 percent of respondents say that they save less than $100 per month. And a comparable 2017 survey from GOBankingRates found that 61 percent of Americans don't have enough money in an emergency fund to cover six months' worth of expenses."

""Climate change now represents a near- to mid-term existential threat"" to humanity, warns a recent policy paper by an Australian think tank. Civilization, scientists say, could collapse by 2050. Some people may survive. Not many.

Some dismiss such purveyors of apocalyptic prognoses as hysterics. To the contrary, they're Pollyannas. Every previous ""worst-case scenario"" prediction for the climate has turned out to have understated the gravity of the situation. ""Paleoclimatologists have shown that past warming episodes show that there are mechanisms which magnify its effects, not represented in current climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Paris Accords,"" reports The Independent. It’'s probably too optimistic to assume that we'll make it to 2050.

Gives new meaning to Generation X.

Millennials and the children we call Generation Z face the horrifying prospect that they will get stuck with the tab for humanity's centuries-long rape of planet earth, the mass desecration of which radically accelerated after 1950. There is an intolerably high chance that today's young people will starve to death, die of thirst, be killed by a superstorm, succumb to a new disease, boil to death, asphyxiate from air pollution, be murdered in a riot, or shot or blown up in a war sparked by environmentally-related political instability long before they survive to old age.

Long threatened, never taken seriously, not even now that it's staring us right in the face, human extinction is coming for the children and grandchildren we claim to love but won't lift a finger to save.

Shelves sag under the weight of books that have been written arguing that we still have a chance to save ourselves. I wish I could believe that. Human population has tripled since the 1950s. More than a million species have gone extinct. Ninety percent of the fish in the ocean have vanished, replaced by one billion tons of plastic. Two-thirds of the trees have been cut down. The polar ice cap is gone; it’s never coming back.

We can't stop global warming. An increase of four degrees Celsius over the baseline set at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution means game over. We're well on our way there. It doesn't make sense to think that we can avoid extinction.

What if we woke up and demanded action from our political leaders? Radical problems require radical solutions; only the most radical of solutions could resolve the most radical problem of ruining our planet's ability to sustain us: revolution. We would have to rise up and abolish—immediately—consumer capitalism in all the major greenhouse gas-producing nations, prioritize cleaning the environment as the human race's top concern, and pivot to an economic mindset in which we extract the bare minimum from the ecosystem that we need in order to survive and nothing more.

Voting might achieve some incremental reforms but reform falls far short of what we require. Saving our young people (and their children, should they be foolish enough to have any) would require global revolution, the violent overthrow of the ruling elites, and replacing them with people who understand what must be done. It would need to happen today. Fifty years ago would be better. Got a time machine?

None of this is going to happen. We are going to sleepwalk to our doom in a haze of social media and corporate entertainment distraction.

So it's time for people who are younger than I am to start thinking about how they want to spend the rest of their likely-to-be-truncated lives, and how they plan to face mass premature death.

Pending human extinction destroys the answers provided by religion and philosophy. Knowing that there won't be anyone to know that we were ever here raises the question: why bother to do anything? This column, this year's ""important"" presidential election, love, hate, everything will lose its meaning when the last member of our species draws her last breath. Earth is unlikely to be visited by an alien archaeologist, much less uncover everything we've made and created (assuming any of it survives), much less figure out what any of it meant, before the sun expands into a red giant and ends it all.

Much is to be said for hedonism: eat, drink, have sex, and don't bother to sort your recycling, for tomorrow we die. Stoicism has its advantages too; go out with dignity rather than weeping and gnashing your teeth and making your fellow survivors miserable.

Nihilism is about to become the best worst possible life strategy. Life is meaningless. That will soon become obvious. Moral principles, relics of a time with a future, will blow away like the irradiated dust we leave behind.

None of this will have mattered."
U.S. Small Business Bailout Money Flowed to Chinese-Owned Companies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/us/politics/virus-china-ppp-small-business-loans.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis, but as the White House looks to stabilize small businesses in the United States, the rescue effort has had an unintended beneficiary: Chinese companies.

Millions of dollars of American taxpayer money have flowed to China from the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program that was created in March to be a lifeline for struggling small businesses in the United States. But because the economic relief legislation allowed American subsidiaries of foreign firms to receive the loans, a substantial chunk of the money went to America’s biggest economic rival, a new analysis shows.

According to a review of publicly available loan data by the strategy consulting firm Horizon Advisory, $192 million to $419 million has gone to more than 125 companies that Chinese entities own or invest in. Many of the loans were quite sizable; at least 32 Chinese companies received loans worth more than $1 million, with those totaling as much as $180 million.

“The extent and nature of P.R.C.-owned, -invested and -connected entities among the P.P.P. loan recipients indicate that without appropriate policy guardrails, U.S. tax dollars intended for relief, recovery and growth of the U.S. economy — and small businesses in particular — risk supporting foreign competitors, namely China,” wrote Emily de La Bruyère and Nathan Picarsic, the co-founders of Horizon Advisory, referring to the People’s Republic of China."
World-wide governments are 'misleading' us on climate: Greta Thunberg,https://www.sbs.com.au/news/world-wide-governments-are-misleading-us-on-climate-greta-thunberg,"Business and political leaders are misleading the public by holding negotiations that are not leading to real action against warming temperatures, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg says.

""The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,"" the Swedish 16-year-old said Wednesday in a speech at the plenary of the ongoing UN climate talks in Madrid, or COP25.

""Finding holistic solutions is what the COP should be all about, but instead it seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes and to avoid raising their ambition.""

AP

The activist cited scientific reports that have established that unchecked warming above 1.5C for the planet would be catastrophic.

She also said pledges to reduce emissions were not enough, carbon needed to remain underground and greenhouse gases responsible for rising temperatures needed to be brought to zero.

""This is not leading, this is misleading,"" she said, adding ""every fraction of a degree matters"".

Politicians in Madrid are grappling with outstanding issues in the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to avert catastrophic global warming, including the spiny issue of accounting for carbon emissions.

Many countries and companies are relying on the idea of carbon markets to meet goals to cut greenhouse gas output and help limit temperature rises to between 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Supporters of carbon markets say they can serve to lower the cost of reducing emissions and enable countries to commit to more ambitious targets. Others see them as a way to stall more aggressive action to cut emissions.

Ms Thunberg said many pledges to balance out emissions in this way did not include the impact of shipping, aviation and international trade, and called for quicker action."
"Half-measures won't save nature, scientists warn: ""So far, efforts to protect and restore nature on a global scale have failed spectacularly.""",https://today.rtl.lu/news/science-and-environment/a/1600161.html,"Bending the curve of nature's rapid decline will require attacking the problem aggressively along several fronts at once, leading scientists warned Thursday.

From preventing the extinction of lions and polar bears to halting the destruction of life-sustaining primary forests, only a multi-pronged plan can stitch together a ""safety net"" for the natural world, they argued in a peer-reviewed commentary in Science.

""It will not be enough to have, for example, an ambitious goal for reducing species extinctions if goals for ecosystems and genetic diversity are not sufficiently ambitious too,"" co-author Piero Visconti, a researcher at the International Institute for Applied System Analysis said in a statement.

The nature rescue plan from 60 experts worldwide is offered as a blueprint ahead of a biodiversity summit next year in China.

Originally scheduled for this month, the ""COP15"" negotiation of nearly 200 nations under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity -- postponed due to the pandemic -- is tasked with setting new goals.

So far, efforts to protect and restore nature on a global scale have failed spectacularly.

The planet is on the cusp of a mass extinction event in which species are disappearing at 100 to 1,000 times the normal ""background"" rate, most scientists agree.

- Make-or-break moment -

The UN's science advisory panel for biodiversity warned in a landmark report last year that one million species face extinction, due mostly to habitat loss and over-exploitation.

Human activity, it concluded, had ""severely degraded"" three-quarters of ice-free land on the planet.

A score of 2020 targets set by the same UN body a decade ago -- including a slowdown in habitat and species loss -- have all been badly missed, according to a UN assessment last month.

Indeed environmental decline continues across a wide range of measures.

In 2019, a football pitch of primary, old-growth trees was destroyed every six seconds -- about 38,000 square kilometres (14,500 square miles) in all, roughly the same as in previous years, according to satellite data.

Last month the WWF's biennial Living Planet Index showed that wild populations of animals, birds, fish and plants have plummeted nearly 70 percent since 1970.

""We are utterly failing to protect the diversity of life on Earth,"" Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and co-chair of the international Earth Commission, said at the time.

""We are failing to protect the resilience of our global commons. And we are failing to ensure a stable planet for future generations,"" he said.

Next year's biodiversity summit is widely seen by experts as a make-or-break moment for halting and reversing nature's destruction.

""All the evidence lines up to tell us that 2030 is a crucial deadline and that we must succeed in defining ambitious and tangible targets,"" co-author Yunne Jai Shin, research director at the Research Institute for Development in Marseilles, told AFP."
Federal Reserve data shows over 100 million in US out of labor force,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/10/22/econ-o21.html,"Data released by the US Federal Reserve earlier this month reveals that nearly 39 percent of the US labor force, nearly 101 million people, are not working, a jump of nearly 6 million from February 2020.

This is near the highest total ever recorded by the Fed, which was in April of this year when it found that over 103 million were out of the labor force, compared to 95 million in February 2020. Despite lifesaving lockdown measures being quickly abandoned at the insistence of the financial oligarchy in April and May, the number has continued to hover above 100 million, only briefly dipping below that mark in August, before increasing again in September.

This staggering total gives some indication of the real level of joblessness and all the hardship and misery that entails for millions of people and their families. The Fed classifies the “US labor force” as every US citizen 16 or over who is not incarcerated, in the US military, or in nursing or residential care homes. This means retirees are still considered part of the labor force.

According to 2019 US census data, there are roughly 328,500,000 people in the US. Of those, roughly 260 million are over the age of 16 and 16.5 percent, or some 54 million, are over the age of 65. Capitalism demands constant exploitation of workers, regardless of age, and census data show that nearly 25 percent of those over age 65 are still working.

Overall, about 160 million people in the US were considered employed at the end of February 2020. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured the Labor Force Participation Rate at 63.4 percent at that time. However, by April 2020 it had dipped to 60.2 percent and had leveled off at 61.4 percent as of September 2020.

The Fed considers the over 100 million people not in the labor force, a huge swath of the population, as “neither employed or unemployed.” Most are not included in the official BLS unemployment statistics because they are not “currently” looking for work, creating a statistical blind spot that conceals rather than reveals the true state of employment in the US.

The official unemployment rate stands at 7.9 percent in the US as of September, down from 14.7 percent in April. However, as the Fed data shows, this is not a true representation of how many people are not working. If only about 8 percent of the country did not have a job, then there should only be roughly 20.8 million people out of work, instead of 101 million. Further BLS reporting shows, over 25 million people in the US are collecting some form of government assistance, whether through federal pandemic unemployment assistance or state unemployment benefits.

There are several reasons which help explain why so many are considered to be “not looking for work” but still in need of a job.

Not counting 40 million retirees and pensioners, there are many reasons why workers would not be “looking” for a job, but still in desperate straits, the main reason being they are watching out for their personal safety. As the US enters the “third wave” of the coronavirus pandemic, which has already claimed 227,000 lives in the US alone, thousands of workers have no confidence that their workplace will implement safety measures needed in order to prevent the spread of the virus.

Over 21 state,s including Wisconsin, North and South Dakota, Kentucky, Tennessee, Utah, Idaho, and Iowa, are seeing 25 or more new daily cases per 100,000 thousand people, an indication of unchecked community spread.

As millions continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and shelter at home when possible, some small businesses, particularly restaurants and bars are reducing or furloughing staff, if not shutting down entirely.

Millions of workers have been put on extended leaves of absences which, while not affecting the unemployment rate, would increase the number “not in the labor force” since they might not be looking for work as they expect to be called back in the future.

Another reason for the drastic increase in the number of workers not in the labor force is that thousands of workers, fearful of being laid off, have been coerced into accepting early retirement packages. Several large companies that received billions in government relief through the CARES Act, such as major US airlines Delta, United and Southwest, with the assistance of the trade unions, have forced early retirements on thousands of workers.

Despite the harrowing economic and social reality facing millions of workers and their families, an indifferent ruling class has let yet another coronavirus relief bill “deadline” pass with no agreement in place. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had imposed a “48 hour” deadline on Sunday, stating that unless a deal was reached between her and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by 3 p.m. on Tuesday, no deal would be forthcoming until after the election. After the deadline passed, Pelosi and Mnuchin announced, after a reported 48-minute phone call, that they would continue to negotiate, with another session scheduled for Thursday.

Representatives from both political parties have endlessly talked and dithered about “getting a deal done” in the 11 weeks since the $600 supplemental federal unemployment benefit expired, while millions slid into poverty, destitution and hunger. As part of the political theater, Pelosi and senior White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow have continued to claim “progress” whenever a temporary boost to the Dow Jones industrial average is needed.

On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell poured water on the prospects of a deal, advising President Donald Trump and fellow Senate Republicans not to agree to anything with Pelosi ahead of the election. McConnell cited the impending Senate confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court next week as a reason why a deal could not be done, insisting the Senate should be focused on ensuring the Supreme Court would be in a position to facilitate Trump’s announced plans to override his likely defeat at the polls.

Wednesday saw more of the same, with prospects for a deal before the election dimming by the day. In the Senate, Democrats blocked a $500 billion Republican stimulus package, which was devoid of local and state aid as well as $1,200 stimulus checks. In the evening Trump tweeted that he did not “...see any way Nancy Pelosi and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer will be willing to do what is right for our great American workers, or our wonderful USA itself, on Stimulus. Their primary focus is BAILING OUT poorly run (and high crime) Democrat cities and states...Should take care of our people. It wasn’t their fault that the Plague came in from China.”"

Under current plans, the US would join Brazil and Russia on the list of forbidden countries, as all three countries have had comparably poor responses to the virus since the worldwide outbreak at the beginning of the year. Travel from China, as well as some developing countries, will be allowed, the report states.

The EU is still finalizing the list, the NYT reports, and it expects to submit it to the 27 bloc members next week ahead of the July 1st reopening deadline. Members are being strongly encouraged to adopt it or else the EU may consider reinstating stricter borders within the bloc to prevent travelers from countries on the list from entering into one country with looser restrictions and crossing the border into another.

The US joins Brazil and Russia on the draft of the EU travel ban list

The US, with nearly 2.4 million confirmed cases and more than 123,000 deaths, has for some time now been the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, while Brazil is second with more than 1.1 million cases and more than 51,000 deaths. Russia’s containment appears better than the US, with under 10,000 reported deaths and a little over half a million confirmed cases.

All three countries are deemed unsafe according to a set of epidemiological criteria the EU has been using to analyze countries. The primary metric is a measure of the average number of new cases per 100,000 people over the last 14 days. The EU bloc has an average of 14. The US score is 107, while Brazil’s is 180 and Russia’s is 80, the NYT reports.

We did a great job on CoronaVirus, including the very early ban on China, Ventilator production, and Testing, which is by far the most, and best, in the World. We saved millions of U.S. lives.! Yet the Fake News refuses to acknowledge this in a positive way. But they do give.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 23, 2020

Trump, like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, fumbled the early response to the virus, downplaying the severity and refusing to enact public health and safety measures that could have contained the virus early on. Trump’s most significant response was to ban travel from China in January and from the EU in March, but the virus has continued to spread through the US due to poor government coordination, planning, and messaging at the federal and state levels.

While rates of new cases have fallen elsewhere, including the EU, the rate of new cases in the US is alarmingly flat. In parts of the country that are beginning to reopen, the numbers are starting to surge, suggesting a thorough failure to contain the virus. In the past few days, Trump has also begun erroneously claiming the US testing rate is too high, which he says results in an inflated number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 despite the obvious reality that positive test results paint about the state of the virus and its spread among US populations."
Suicide is the second-leading cause of death,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/opinion/suicide-young-people.amp.html,"Teenagers and young adults in the United States are being ravaged by a mental health crisis — and we are doing nothing about it. As of 2017, statistics show that an alarming number of them are suffering from depression and dying by suicide. In fact, suicide is now the second leading cause of death among young people, surpassed only by accidents.

After declining for nearly two decades, the suicide rate among Americans ages 10 to 24 jumped 56 percent between 2007 and 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And for the first time the gender gap in suicide has narrowed: Though the numbers of suicides are greater in males, the rates of suicide for female youths increased by 12.7 percent each year, compared with 7.1 percent for male youths.

At the same time, the rate of teen depression shot up 63 percent, an alarming but not surprising trend given the link between suicide and depression: In 2017, 13 percent of teens reported at least one episode of depression in the past year, compared with 8 percent of teens in 2007, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

How is it possible that so many of our young people are suffering from depression and killing themselves when we know perfectly well how to treat this illness? If thousands of teens were dying from a new infectious disease or a heart ailment, there would be a public outcry and a national call to action."

The child mental health crisis is escalating due to ""invisible harms"" such as climate change and a more intense news cycle, according to a London-based counsellor.

Louis Weinstock is the co-founder of Apart of Me, an app designed to engage young people and help them process their grief.

It was inspired by his work at a school for excluded pupils and a Hackney-based hospice.

While he has worked with children on the extreme end of harm - those who have suffered neglect and abuse - he told the Standard he believes exposure to broader world issues are driving the escalation in the child mental health crisis.

""Just because they're invisible doesn't mean they are not as negative, as bad for the children's mind (as personal trauma),"" he said.

""We've moved into a situation where there are many more invisible harms: from the collapse ecological system that supports us, to technologies that are designed to addict us and be ultimately harmful to our mental health, the news cycle and the exaggeration of emotions like fear and anger and outrage.""

In 2018, a Children’s Society report revealed more than 100,000 children aged 14 in the UK are self-harming, with 22 per cent of girls affected.

Last year, the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2018 there was a 13.9 per cent rise from 2017 in the suicide rate among 10 to 19-year-olds.

When children are dealing with trauma, particularly if it is unresolved, Mr Weinstock said it can manifest itself in what many would interpret as bad behaviour, such as skipping school or hanging out with people who can be a bad influence.

""I have young people more and more who are coming to see me who are really feeling complicated feelings when they hear about the fires in Australia or they are hearing about what is happening with climate change,"" he said.

""They're experiencing a world that seems to be veering into some kind of collapse and its very hard for them - and it's hard for their parents to know - what to do with those feelings.""

One child in particular who Mr Weinstock worked with had been suspended from school after walking out of class a number of times.

When asked what was going on, Mr Weinstock said: ""He said that everyone was being fake.... that all the adults around him were just going around and acting as though everything is fine.

""But he said: 'I've been reading, I've been watching stuff I've been doing my research into what's going on in the world and particularly around climate and I feel completely hopeless about it.'""

Mr Weinstock added that while many would typically respond to the child by trying to make them feel better about the situation or find a quick fix, it is better to validate their feelings.

""It's valid to have feelings of hopelessness, it's valid to have feelings of despair about what's going on in the world,"" he said.

""We really need a different perspective on working with mental health in this day and age to really understand that children's minds are affected in so many more of these invisible ways and learn to not just try and brush it under the carpet.""

This experience is part of the reason why Mr Weinstock developed the app Apart of Me, which guides users through a peaceful and beautiful island that is home to areas of mediation, community, and games that help them to work through grief, such as learning how to label emotions.

Young people experiencing grief have been brought in to co-develop the game, which ultimately aims for the person to become a ""guide"" - where they can use their grief as a way to support others going through a similar experience.

""I wanted a place that they could access whenever they felt like they needed some support,"" Mr Weinstock said. ""Grief doesn't show up for a 50-minute counselling slot once a week.""

He said he also wants to bring ease to conversations around death, which young people are often excluded from.

""People think they are protecting them by excluding them,"" he added.

""But actually children are picking up what's going on in the environment anyway and it can end up affecting them much worse if people are unable to be a bit more upfront with them about it.""

The app, launched last year and already accessed by nearly 75,000 people around the world, has been accessed by many outside the 13 to 25 year age group it targets.

""I had a palliative care social worker contact me a few months ago saying how helpful she'd found the game because she didn't actually have a space where she could process the grief she was carrying from just working with people's grief all the time,"" Mr Weinstock said.

He hopes to now work on building a community within the game where young people can connect and provide support for each other, a concept inspired by an African tribe who have weekly meetings to air their grievances, bringing about a sense of well-being.

""There's the obvious grief when you lose someone but there's also the grief that you experience when you lose your first teddy bear or things don't go your way or experiencing grief at what's going on in the world,"" he said. ""I have a theory that we're all walking around with this unresolved grief.""

"Society will collapse by 2040 due to catastrophic food shortages, says study. ""Based on plausible climate trends and a total failure to change course, the global food supply system would face catastrophic losses, and an unprecedented epidemic of food riots."" (June, 2015)",https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/society-will-collapse-by-2040-due-to-catastrophic-food-shortages-says-study-10336406.html,"A scientific model has suggested that society will collapse in less than three decades due to catastrophic food shortages if policies do not change.

The model, developed by a team at Anglia Ruskin University’s Global Sustainability Institute, does not account for society reacting to escalating crises by changing global behaviour and policies.

However the model does show that our current way of life appears to be unsustainable and could have dramatic worldwide consequences.

Dr Aled Jones, the Director of the Global Sustainability Institute, told Insurge Intelligence: ""We ran the model forward to the year 2040, along a business-as-usual trajectory based on ‘do-nothing’ trends — that is, without any feedback loops that would change the underlying trend.

""The results show that based on plausible climate trends, and a total failure to change course, the global food supply system would face catastrophic losses, and an unprecedented epidemic of food riots.

""In this scenario, global society essentially collapses as food production falls permanently short of consumption.""

The report said: ""The global food system is under chronic pressure to meet an ever-rising demand, and its vulnerability to acute disruptions is compounded by factors such as climate change, water stress, ongoing globalisation and heightening political instability.

""A global production shock of the kind set out in this scenario would be expected to generate major economic and political impacts that could affect clients across a very wide spectrum of insurance classes. This analysis has presented the initial findings for some of the key risk exposures.

Just go out there and have a good time—don’t worry about any of this,” said climate scientist Annalisa Feldt who tore in half the report she had compiled and suggested everyone consider traveling to a place they’ve never been before, or taking up a pastime they’ve always imagined might be fun. “Go see a show. Join an intramural sports league. Learn a musical instrument. Have more sex. Try skiing, if you never have, although that’s one you’d better do within the next five years or so.” Reiterating the need for people to live it up while they still can, the climatologists announced that if anyone was interested in joining them, they would be skipping the remainder of the conference to get completely shit-faced at the nearest bar.

Scientists: Earth Endangered by New Strain of Fact-Resistant Humans,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/scientists-earth-endangered-by-new-strain-of-fact-resistant-humans,"MINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)—Scientists have discovered a powerful new strain of fact-resistant humans who are threatening the ability of Earth to sustain life, a sobering new study reports.

The research, conducted by the University of Minnesota, identifies a virulent strain of humans who are virtually immune to any form of verifiable knowledge, leaving scientists at a loss as to how to combat them.

“These humans appear to have all the faculties necessary to receive and process information,” Davis Logsdon, one of the scientists who contributed to the study, said. “And yet, somehow, they have developed defenses that, for all intents and purposes, have rendered those faculties totally inactive.”

More worryingly, Logsdon said, “As facts have multiplied, their defenses against those facts have only grown more powerful.”

While scientists have no clear understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the fact-resistant humans from absorbing data, they theorize that the strain may have developed the ability to intercept and discard information en route from the auditory nerve to the brain. “The normal functions of human consciousness have been completely nullified,” Logsdon said.

While reaffirming the gloomy assessments of the study, Logsdon held out hope that the threat of fact-resistant humans could be mitigated in the future. “Our research is very preliminary, but it’s possible that they will become more receptive to facts once they are in an environment without food, water, or oxygen,” he said."
"Chris Hedges: ""We live in an age of radical evil. The architects of this evil are despoiling the earth and driving the human species toward extinction.""",https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-age-of-radical-evil/,"Chris Hedges, an ordained Presbyterian minister, gave this sermon Sunday at the Claremont Presbyterian Church in Claremont, Calif.

Immanuel Kant coined the term “radical evil.” It was the privileging of one’s own interest over that of others, effectively reducing those around you to objects to be manipulated and used for your own ends. But Hannah Arendt, who also used the term “radical evil,” saw that it was worse than merely treating others as objects. Radical evil, she wrote, rendered vast numbers of people superfluous. They possessed no value at all. They were, once they could not be utilized by the powerful, discarded as human refuse.

We live in an age of radical evil. The architects of this evil are despoiling the earth and driving the human species toward extinction. They are stripping us of our most basic civil liberties and freedoms. They are orchestrating the growing social inequity, concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a cabal of global oligarchs. They are destroying our democratic institutions, turning elected office into a system of legalized bribery, stacking our courts with judges who invert constitutional rights so that unlimited corporate money invested in political campaigns is disguised as the right to petition the government or a form of free speech. Their seizure of power has vomited up demagogues and con artists including Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, each the distortion of a failed democracy. They are turning America’s poor communities into internal militarized colonies where police carry out lethal campaigns of terror and use the blunt instrument of mass incarceration as a tool of social control. They are waging endless wars in the Middle East and diverting half of all discretionary spending to a bloated military. They are placing the rights of the corporation above the rights of the citizen.

Arendt captured the radical evil of a corporate capitalism in which people are rendered superfluous—surplus labor as Karl Marx said—and pushed to the margins of society where they and their children are no longer considered to have value, value always determined by the amount of money produced and amassed. But as the Gospel of Luke reminds us, “what is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God.”

Who are those who would sacrifice us on the altar of global capitalism? How did they amass the power to deny us a voice, to insist that the earth is an inert commodity they have a right to exploit until the ecosystem that sustains life collapses and the human species, along with most other species, becomes extinct?

These architects of radical evil have been here from the beginning. They are the slaveholders who crammed men, women and children into the holds of ships and sold them in auctions in Charleston and Montgomery, rending families apart, taking from them their names, language, religion and culture. They wielded the whips, the chains, the dogs and the slave patrols. They orchestrated the holocaust of slavery, and when slavery was abolished, after a war that left 700,000 dead, they used convict leasing—slavery by another name—along with lynching and black codes, to carry out a reign of terror that continues today in our deindustrialized cities and our prisons. Black and brown bodies are worth nothing to our corporate masters when on the streets of our decayed cities, but locked in cages they each generate 50 or 60 thousand dollars a year. Some people say the system does not work. They are wrong. The system works exactly as it is designed to work.

These architects of radical evil are the white militias and Army units that stole the land, decimated the herds of buffalo, signed the treaties that were promptly violated and carried out a campaign of genocide against indigenous people, penning the few who remained in prisoner of war camps. They are the gun thugs, Baldwin-Felts and Pinkerton agents who gunned down, by the hundreds, American workers struggling to organize, forces of the kind that today oversee the bonded labor of workers in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh. They are the oligarchs, J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller and Carnegie, who paid for these rivers of blood, and who today, like Tim Cook at Apple and Jeff Bezos at Amazon, amass staggering fortunes from human misery.

We know these architects of radical evil. They are the DNA of American capitalism. You can find them on the commodity desks at Goldman Sachs. The financial firm’s commodities index is the most heavily traded in the world. These traders buy up futures of rice, wheat, corn, sugar and livestock and jack up the commodity prices by as much as 200% on the global market so that the poor in Asia, Africa and Latin America can no longer afford basic staples, and starve. Hundreds of millions of people go hungry to feed this mania for profit, this radical evil that sees human beings, including children, as worth nothing.

These architects of radical evil extract the coal, oil and gas, poisoning our air, soil and water, while demanding huge taxpayer subsidies and blocking the urgent transition to renewable energy. They are the massive corporations that own the factory farms, egg hatcheries and dairy farms where tens of billions of animals endure horrendous abuse before being needlessly slaughtered, part of an animal agriculture industry that is one of the leading multifactorial causes of climate catastrophe. They are the generals and arms manufacturers. They are the bankers, hedge fund managers and global speculators who looted $7 trillion from the U.S. treasury after the pyramid schemes and fraud they carried out imploded the global economy in 2007-2008. They are the goons in state security who make us the most spied-upon, watched, monitored and photographed population in human history. When your government watches you 24 hours a day you cannot use the word “liberty.” This is the relationship between a master and a slave.

Corporate culture serves a faceless system. It is, as Hannah Arendt wrote, “the rule of nobody and for this very reason perhaps the least human and most cruel form of rulership.” It will stop at nothing. Anyone or any movement that attempts to impede their profits will be targeted for obliteration. These architects of radical evil are incapable of reform. Appealing to their better nature is a waste of time. They don’t have one. They have rigged the system, elections dominated by corporate money, the courts, the press a vast burlesque show for profit, which is why they spend so much time focused on Trump. There is no way to vote against the interests of Goldman Sachs or Exxon, Shell, BP and Chevron, which along with the other top 20 fossil fuel corporations have contributed 35% of all energy-related carbon dioxide and methane emissions worldwide—480 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965.

We know these architects of radical evil. They have been and always will be with us.

But who are those who resist? Where do they come from? What historical, social and cultural forces created them?

They too are familiar. They are Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, John Brown, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. They are Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph. They are Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Emma Goldman. They are “Big Bill” Haywood, Joe Hill and Eugene V. Debs. They are Woody Guthrie, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. They are Andrea Dworkin and Caesar Chavez. They are those who from the beginning fought back, often to be defeated by this radical evil but knowing they were called to defy it, even at the cost of their own reputations, financial security, social standing and sometimes their lives.

The architects of radical evil are disemboweling every last social service program funded by the taxpayers, from education to Social Security, because lives that do not swell their profits are considered superfluous. Let the sick die. Let many of the poor—41 million people, including children—go to bed hungry. Let families be tossed into the streets. Let the young graduate have no meaningful employment. Let the U.S. prison system, with 25% of the world’s prison population, swell. Let torture continue. Let assault rifles proliferate to fuel the epidemic of mass shootings. Let the roads, bridges, dams, levees, power grids, rail lines, subways, bus services, schools and libraries crumble or close. Let the rising temperatures, the freak weather patterns, the monster cyclones and hurricanes, the droughts, the flooding, the tornadoes, the wildfires, the melting polar ice caps, the poisoned water systems and the polluted air worsen until the species dies.

Many in the church are complicit in this radical evil, failing to name it and denounce it, just as we failed to see in the thousands of men, women and children who were lynched the very crucifixion itself, as James Cone pointed out. And this complicity and silence condemns us. It is why W.E.B. Du Bois called “white religion” a “miserable failure.”

“Black people did not need to go to seminary and study theology to know that white Christianity was fraudulent,” Cone wrote in “The Cross and the Lynching Tree.” “As a teenager in the South where whites treated blacks with contempt, I and other blacks knew that the Christian identity of whites was not a true expression of what it means to follow Jesus. Nothing their theologians and preachers could say would convince us otherwise. We wondered how whites could live with their hypocrisy—such blatant contradiction of the man from Nazareth. (I am still wondering about that!) White conservative Christianity’s blatant endorsement of lynching as a part of its religion, and white liberal Christians’ silence about lynching placed both outside of Christian identity. I could not find one sermon or theological essay, not to mention a book, opposing lynching by a prominent liberal white preacher. There was no way a community could support or ignore lynching in America, while still representing in word and deed the one who was lynched by Rome.”

We have failed to denounce the Christian fascists who peddle a magic Jesus who will make us rich, a Jesus who blesses America above other countries and the white race above other races, a Jesus who turns the barbarity of war into a holy crusade, for the heretics they are. And we have failed, as well, to confront the radical evil of corporate capitalism. Let us not once again render our faith a miserable failure.

Defying evil cannot be rationally defended. It makes a leap into the moral, which is beyond rational thought. It refuses to place a monetary value on human life or the natural world. It refuses to see anyone as superfluous. It acknowledges human life, indeed all life, as sacred. And this is why, as Arendt points out, the only morally reliable people are not those who say “this is wrong” or “this should not be done,” but those who say “I can’t do this.”

Those who come out of a religious tradition, any religious tradition, have a responsibility to fight this latest iteration of radical evil, which is swiftly ensuring that our species and many other species will not have a future on this earth. It is our religious duty to place our bodies in front of the machine, as many of us did in the protests organized by Extinction Rebellion last week around the globe.

“The law, as presently revered and taught and enforced, is becoming an enticement to lawlessness,” Dan Berrigan wrote. “Lawyers and laws and courts and penal systems are nearly immobile before a shaken society, which is making civil disobedience a civil (I dare say a religious) duty. The law is aligning itself more and more with forms of power whose existence is placed more and more in question. … So, if they would obey the law, [people] are being forced, in the present crucial instance, either to disobey God or to disobey the law of humanity.”

Let us not in this present historical period replicate our sins of the past. Let us affirm our faith by affirming our defiance, our willingness to engage in the acts of sustained civil disobedience against the forces of radical evil. Let future generations say of us that we tried, that we were not complicit through our collaboration or our silence. There will be a cost. History shows us that. All moral battles have a cost, and if there is not a cost then the battle is not moral. Accept becoming an outcast. Jesus, after all, was an outcast. We are called by God to defy radical evil. This defiance is the highest form of spirituality."
Scientists warn humanity about worldwide insect decline,https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-02/uoh-swh020720.php,"They also suggest ways to recognise and avert its consequences

Engaging civil society and policy makers is essential for the future and mutual well-being both of people and insects. In addition to mitigating climate change, an important aspect of the solution involves setting aside high-quality and manageable portions of land for conservation, and transforming global agricultural practices to promote species co-existence.

Humanity is pushing many ecosystems beyond recovery. As a consequence, unquantified and unquantifiable insect extinctions are happening every day. Two scientific papers by 30 experts from around the world discuss both the perils and ways to avoid further extinctions, intending to contribute towards a necessary change of attitude for humanity's own sake.

""It is surprising how little we know about biodiversity at a global level, when only about 10 to 20 per cent of insect and other invertebrate species have been described and named. And of those with a name, we know little more than a brief morphological description, maybe a part of the genetic code and a single site where it was seen some time ago,"" says Pedro Cardoso, from the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus, University of Helsinki, Finland.

The results of recently published works make it clear that the situation is dire

Habitat loss, pollution - including harmful agricultural practices, invasive species that do not encounter borders, climate change, overexploitation and extinction of dependent species all variably contribute to documented insect population declines and species extinctions.

""With species loss, we lose not only another piece of the complex puzzle that is our living world, but also biomass, essential for example to feed other animals in the living chain, unique genes and substances that might one day contribute to cure diseases, and ecosystem functions on which humanity depends,"" confirms Cardoso.

The ecosystem functions he mentions include pollination, as most crops depend on insects to survive. Additionally, decomposition, as they contribute to nutrient cycling, as well as many other functions for which we have no technological or other replacement.

Practical solutions to mitigate insect apocalypse

The researchers also suggest possible practical solutions based on existing evidence gathered from around the world, which would help to avoid further insect population loss and species extinctions. These include actions such as setting aside high-quality and manageable portions of land for conservation, transforming global agricultural practices to promote species co-existence, and mitigating climate change.

Above all, communicating and engaging with civil society and policy makers is essential for the future and mutual well-being both of people and insects.

""While small groups of people can impact insect conservation locally, collective consciousness and a globally coordinated effort for species inventorying, monitoring and conservation is required for large-scale recovery"" says Michael Samways, Distinguished Professor at Stellenbosch University, South Africa.

Ideas to help insects

1. Avoid mowing your garden frequently; let nature grow and feed insects. 2. Plant native plants; many insects need only these to survive. 3. Avoid pesticides; go organic, at least for your own backyard. 4. Leave old trees, stumps and dead leaves alone; they are home to countless species. 5. Build an insect hotel with small horizontal holes that can become their nests. 6. Reduce your carbon footprint; this affects insects as much as other organisms. 7. Support and volunteer in conservation organizations. 8. Do not import or release living animals or plants into the wild that could harm native species. 9. Be more aware of tiny creatures; always look on the small side of life.

Coronavirus: Italy becoming impatient with lockdown - and social unrest is brewing,https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-italy-becoming-impatient-with-lockdown-and-social-unrest-is-brewing-11965122,"Videos have emerged of desperate people in Italy begging for help because they have run out of money and food.

Well into its third week of the coronavirus lockdown, Italy is still seeing many hundreds of people dying each day.

Progress in containing the COVID-19 spread is slow, hope and patience are fading and the economic cost is becoming ever more acute.

The strain is showing in the south of the country where one man in Apulia reportedly called police after the bank closed and they couldn't withdraw his mother's pension - their only income.

Footage shows him shouting at officers, telling them the family has no money, his mother begging them to go to their home so she could show them they have no food. It's hard to watch. It's what desperation looks like.

Another video has been shared around the country showing a father with his young daughter addressing the Italian prime minister, saying: ""It's already 15-20 days that we've been inside and we're at our limit.""

He gestures to his little girl who is eating a piece of bread and says: ""Like my daughter, other children in a few days won't be able to eat this bit of bread. Rest assured, you will regret this because we're going to have a revolution.""

Images have also emerged of police descending on supermarkets in Palermo in Sicily after reports people have started stealing to feed themselves. And groups have been set up in the last few days on social media to organise raids of supermarkets.

Sky News was sent a video message of a man in Sicily with a gun even offering to kill.

The mayor of Palermo told Sky News crime gangs are exploiting people's hardship and inciting violence - he warns a social emergency is next.

""Discomfort and malaise are growing and we are recording worrying reports of protest and anger that is being exploited by criminals who want to destabilise the system,"" said Leoluca Orlando.

""The more time passes, the more resources are exhausted. The few savings people have are running out. This tells us socio-economic issues will erupt.""

Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has made €25bn available to support families and businesses affected by lockdown. Some say they're still waiting for that help.

Others don't qualify because their employment is not officially recorded. Italy has a big cash economy of unregistered workers - the large majority of this in the south.

The further south you go, the higher the level of deprivation and the higher the unemployment.

While the virus hasn't reached the same crisis levels in southern Italy, hunger and hardship threaten to be even bigger problems.

Italy is ahead of other countries in this outbreak and unrest threatens to be the next chapter in this crisis.

As the country struggles to bring the virus spread under control, the government has extended lockdown from 3 April with no new deadline.

Lockdown is the only solution to save lives.

But in southern Italy, for many, it feels like it's threatening their very survival."
"Italy's coronavirus disaster: At first, officials urged people to go out for an aperitif. Now, doctors must choose who dies",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-18/what-went-wrong-with-how-italy-handled-coronavirus/12062242,"On the afternoon of February 27, I finally got a call through to the local service in Milan conducting swab tests for coronavirus.

I'd been provided their details by Italy's COVID-19 national response team, after initially calling emergency on 112.

When someone who spoke English was found, I explained the situation, as I had done already on three occasions: we had been working near the red zones, had come down with colds and were calling to arrange a swab.

""No, no, no,"" the woman said.

""We don't make this test.""

She told me I had the wrong number, and insisted I call the emergency number.

When I explained that it was in fact 112 which had directed me to her, she was silent for a moment.

Then: ""But that's the only number we have to give you.""

It was an early glimpse into a confused bureaucracy racing to come to grips with an unfolding crisis. At the time, there were only several hundred infections and 12 dead.

Now, the death toll has spiked to more than 2,500, with almost 28,000 people diagnosed with the disease.

On Sunday alone, 368 people died from coronavirus in Italy. On Monday that figure was 349. On Tuesday it was 345.

At the centre of the pandemic is Bergamo — Italy's most infected city — which is now home to apocalyptic scenes.

Coffins waiting to be interred fill the Tempio di Ognissanti, a local cemetery church, which has been converted into an emergency morgue.

The city's crematorium is running on a new 24-hour schedule. Newspaper L'Eco di Bergamo is running 10 pages of obituaries; it normally prints just one.

Bergamo anaesthetist Christian Salaroli told daily newspaper Corriere della Sera that the hospitals were so overwhelmed, and the supply of respirators so inadequate, doctors were having to choose who receives treatment.

""We decide depending on their age and the condition of their health,"" he said.

Watching in horror, many around the world are now wondering how Italy got it so spectacularly wrong?

Italy thought it was under control until Patient One showed up

The country's first known cases were two visitors from Wuhan, in China.

Detected on January 29, they were placed in isolation in a hospital in Rome and the wheels of a national response began to grind forward.

The next day, Italy was the first European state to block all flights to and from China and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared his country's emergency response ""the most rigorous in Europe"".

But a local outbreak was already taking hold. Two weeks after Conte's bold words, a 38-year-old man known only as Mattia — who in the days prior had socialised with friends and competed in a fun run — saw his GP in Codogno complaining of a flu.

On February 16 and then again on February 18, he visited the 24-hour casualty department of the local hospital and was turned away both times with instructions for bed rest.

On neither occasion was he tested for the virus.

It was only after he returned at 3:00am the following day, now experiencing difficulty breathing, that alarm bells began to ring.

He was tested 24 hours later and on February 21 a positive diagnosis was returned. Italy now had its first known local transmission. In the press, the man was dubbed Patient One.

Road blocks were placed around Codogno in an effort to contain the outbreak of coronavirus there, but it was too late. ( ABC News: Andrew Greaves )

So-called red zones were draped over Codogno and 10 other villages in the north of the country and curfews were introduced for bars and restaurants in Lombardy.

When he learned of the sequence of events, Conte fumed. In a television interview, the Prime Minister said: ""We know that the way one hospital facility was managed was not entirely appropriate … [and] that certainly contributed to the spread.""

People were first urged to go out until things got worse

Conte's remarks prompted a war of words with Lombardy's Governor Attilio Fontan and Codogno's head of medicine, Giorgio Scanzi.

""We have done our duty,"" he hit back.

""We have a clear conscience.""

The squabbling reflected a general sense of confusion about the seriousness of the threat.

Fontana told the regional parliament the disease was ""just a little more than a normal flu,"" and the next day, the province even reversed the curfews on restaurants.

The leader of the Democratic Party, Nicola Zingaretti, made a point of showing up at a bar for a very public Aperitivo, the traditional Milanese evening drink, and light supper.

""Let's not lose our habits, we can't stop Milan and Italy,"" Nicola Zingaretti posted on Instagram nine days before he tested positive for COVID-19. ( Instagram: Nicola Zingaretti )

He urged the country to avoid ""destroying life or spreading panic"".

But within nine days, Fontana went into quarantine after an adviser tested positive, and Zingaretti himself contracted the virus.

The following day, on March 8, Rome extended the lockdown from the northern provinces to the nation's frontiers and unveiled a 10 billion euros emergency fund.

In Lombardy alone, confirmed cases of the pathogen had climbed over 4,000, and the death toll was climbing past 267.

Conte delivered a televised address: ""Non c'e' piu' tempo,"" he said, which translated to: ""We have run out of time.""

Coronavirus surfaced during flu season

The scale of the catastrophe in Italy remains difficult to digest.

Just 19 days after Patient One was diagnosed, Italy had 12,462 coronavirus patients, more than 1,000 people in intensive care, and 827 people had already died.

The epicentre of the global crisis had swung from China to Europe.

Many have condemned those initial missteps in Italy as critical errors, including prominent Italian intellectual Beppe Severgnini.

He wrote in the New York Times that ""mistakes were made"" by Italy in the early days of the pandemic.

Severgnini claimed, for example, that the China flights ban may have prompted travellers to enter the country via neighbouring European states, masking the spread of the virus and preventing an effective quarantine.

A scientist from the Italian National Institute of Health told TIME the virus ""had probably been circulating for quite some time"" before it was detected, as the disease surfaced during the normal flu season.

Nino Cartabellotta, a leading Italian public health expert, has raised questions about whether an unusually high number of suspected pneumonia cases a month prior to the outbreak should have been tested.

""It could [also] be that there weren't any severe cases,"" he said.

""[And] they only emerged in a clinically mild way.""

Italy might be a victim of being the first hit

It appears clear now that the only means by which Italy might have headed off the catastrophe was the implementation of its unprecedented national lockdown far earlier, before there was evidence of its prudence — an almost impossible proposition.

""Waiting strategies have always favoured the spread of the virus,"" Cartabellotta said.

Italian health workers are reportedly so overloaded they are having to choose which patients to save. ( Reuters: Flavio Lo Scalzo )

Exponential infection curves are now showing up not just in neighbouring European states, such as Spain and France, but also in the United States and in Australia.

It may be simply that Italy was first by dint of sheer misfortune.

""You can argue they noticed it late,"" infectious diseases modeller from the University of Bern Christian Althaus told the Guardian.

""But that could have happened elsewhere, too. Once they realised what was happening, I think they took it seriously.

""The first lockdown was the right choice, and expanding it nationwide probably too. They realise they need to curb the epidemic.""

Italians are self-isolating at home with mass gatherings banned and restaurants closed to contain the outbreak. ( Reuters: Alberto Lingria )

There's a separate question, however, as to how the disease has been fought.

Italy is recording a mortality rate which rocketed on Sunday (local time) to 7 per cent — double the global average.

Of the G7, Rome's expenditure on public health has hovered at levels behind France, Germany and the UK.

The Servizio Sanitario Nazionale – Italy's answer to the UK's National Health Service – has been grossly underfunded for years.

Lorenzo Casani, who runs a medical clinic for the elderly of Lombardy, told TIME there had been ""continuous cuts to care and to research"".

""We were not prepared,"" he said.

""We do not have enough doctors for the people. We do not have an organised plan for pandemics.""

Casani too described a frightening new reality in which doctors ""have to make this horrible choice and decide who is going to survive and who is not going to survive"".

Part of the picture in Italy is demographic. Almost a quarter of Italians are aged 65 or older, the highest such number in the EU.

Many of these people will be carrying pre-existing conditions and other vulnerabilities to such a virulent new strain of flu.

In an attempt to get the outbreak back under control, Italy is now policing public squares and limiting movement of its 60 million inhabitants.

In Milan, a trade fair pavilion is being converted into an emergency field hospital.

Will other countries learn from Italy's outbreak?

It's not clear however that other European states have been paying sufficient attention to the travails of their neighbour.

Only in recent days have Spain and France enacted similar lockdowns. On Monday, the EU proposed a temporary ban on all non-essential travel to anywhere on the continent.

The UK will be exempt from such a ban, but it appears that London is, in any case, forging a different path through this global disaster.

When my colleague and I were finally allowed to fly out of Italy, we had expected to be screened at Heathrow. We were not.

We placed ourselves in quarantine and tried to arrange a test for the virus; the NHS's COVID-19 hotline was almost as difficult to negotiate as Italy's.

England has yet to introduce any of the more draconian restrictions: schools remain open, as do its borders.

At least 1,300 people in the UK have tested positive for COVID-19 amid a spiralling outbreak in Europe. ( Reuters: Toby Melville )

Until Monday, it appeared Prime Minister Boris Johnson's administration had made a decision to tolerate the spread of the virus through a greater proportion of the UK than many other countries, in pursuit of herd immunity.

But new modelling has revealed this approach risked a potential death toll of 250,000 people.

Johnson has since ramped up the UK's response, asking those who display symptoms to quarantine themselves. He also flagged a three-month isolation for everyone over the age of 70, from this weekend.

It's an attempt, however belated, to head off the horror that has descended on Italy, and prevent the printing of page after page of obituary notices."
American Workers Get a 4-Month Safety Net; Wall Street Gets a 4 to 5-Year Bailout,https://www.newsfromtheperimeter.com/home/2020/4/14/american-workers-get-a-4-month-safety-net-wall-street-gets-a-4-to-5-year-bailout,"(Pam Martens and Russ Martens) The stimulus bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in March, (the CARES Act), increases the miserly amount most states provide in unemployment benefits (an average of $378 weekly) by an additional $600 per week. But that extra $600 only lasts until July 31 — a period of four months. Millions of small businesses, such as restaurants and retail shops, will shut down permanently as a result of this business disruption, meaning that workers in places like Florida, the third most populous state in the U.S., will be back to their preposterously low weekly unemployment allotment of $275 per week in just four months.

Let that sink in for a moment. A worker in Florida, where Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is in charge, is expected to live on $275 a week or $1100 per month, or the annualized amount of $13,200 per year. That $275 a week hasn’t increased in more than two decades, despite the cost of food and housing soaring over that period in Florida. And among the 50 states, Florida ranks dead last in terms of how long its Scrooge-esque unemployment benefit lasts: just 12 weeks versus 26 weeks for most other states.

Other states with Dickensian unemployment benefits include Mississippi at $235 weekly; Arizona at $240; Louisiana at $247; and Alabama at $275.

The CARES Act will give workers an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits, on top of the typical 26 weeks – but only at the rate their state is paying – and those additional weeks will end on December 31 of this year.

In numerous states, newly unemployed workers have been unable to contact their dysfunctional unemployment office. The Tampa Bay Times published stories from laid-off workers attempting, in vain, to file for unemployment benefits in Florida. One worker called it “some sort of sick nightmare.”

In Ohio, workers hoping to get that extra $600 per week will have to wait for the state to hire a vendor to build a computer system to process those claims, according to a report yesterday by the Columbus Dispatch. The newspaper also reported that Ohio has received 696,519 claims for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks, which was double the amount it received for the full year of 2019. Thus far, Ohio has only been able to process payments for 195,000 people.

Now consider how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed) and Congress take care of Wall Street.

On September 17, 2019 the interest rate on overnight loans (repo) made between banks and other financial institutions spiked from the typical 2 percent to 10 percent. There was no coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak anywhere in the world at that point. There were no skyscrapers collapsing on Wall Street. There was no national emergency of any kind to warrant bailing out Wall Street. But within 24 hours the New York Fed had pumped $53 billion to the trading houses on Wall Street. No questions asked. No clogged phone lines. No paperwork to fill out. No standing in lines. No asking Congress for a vote. Just $53 billion created out of thin air by the New York Fed and instantly funneled out to Wall Street’s trading houses with the push of an electronic button.

Over the next six weeks, the New York Fed pumped out more than $6 trillion in below-market rate loans to Wall Street’s trading houses – without one single hearing being held in Congress to investigate what was going on. And, again, there was no national emergency, just bloated behemoth banks on Wall Street with dodgy financials afraid to lend to one another – the exact same situation that brought on the financial crisis in 2008 that led to a $29 trillion secret bailout by the New York Fed that lasted for two and one-half years.

Last year’s repo bailout by the New York Fed is still ongoing but it is now just one of a mind-numbing number of programs the New York Fed has rolled out to bail out Wall Street banks and trading houses. Once again, the money is flowing effortlessly to Wall Street in the trillions of dollars while 10,000 people waited in lines last Thursday in San Antonio, Texas in 90-degree heat to get food from a food pantry.

The Wall Street programs are not going to last for just 4 months or to the end of the year as are the CARES Act’s programs for workers. They are going to last longer than they did during the 2008 financial crash.

The New York Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) will last three years. The Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) will last for four years and buy up investment grade as well as junk-rated corporate bonds to shore up the balance sheets of mega banks on Wall Street. The Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) will last for five years, buying up everything from investment grade to junk corporate bonds as well as junk-rated exchange traded funds (ETFs).

Just how is it that the New York Fed knows that it will need these “emergency” programs to be around for four and five years when the coronavirus outbreak is expected to end within months.

Adding outrageous insult to injury, Congress saw fit in the CARES Act to provide $454 billion of taxpayers’ money to go into this alphabet soup of Wall Street programs to backstop any losses they suffer. Once again, just as in 2008, Wall Street has privatized the profits for the one percent and now the losses will be socialized to workers on Main Street, where 16 million job losses have occurred in just the past three weeks.

Mainstream media has been negligent at informing the public of these outrages by Congress, the Federal Reserve and the New York Fed. Wall Street On Parade began in-depth coverage of this latest Wall Street looting on September 18, 2019 and has chronicled each new development in more than six dozen articles.

"'I'm profoundly sad, I feel guilty': scientists reveal their personal fears about the climate crisis | Environment",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/08/im-profoundly-sad-i-feel-guilty-scientists-reveal-personal-fears-about-the-climate-crisis,"Feelings of powerlessness and despair for the future are evident in letters written for a six-year ‘passion project’

In 2014, Joe Duggan started reaching out to climate scientists to ask them a question: how did climate change make them feel?

“I was just blown away when I started getting the letters back,” he says.

Duggan, a science communicator at Australian National University, set up a website and starting publishing the mostly handwritten responses.

“[Professor] Katrin Meissner was one of the first, and her letter really hit me. It was so ... unscience-y. Almost poetic.”

“It makes me feel sad. And it scares me,” Meissner wrote.

“It scares me more than anything else. I see a group of people sitting in a boat, happily waving, taking pictures on the way, not knowing that this boat is floating right into a powerful and deadly waterfall.”

Scott Morrison's duty is to protect the Australian people and there is no greater threat than climate disruption | Ian Dunlop and David Spratt Read more

In the end, more than 40 scientists responded – many leaders in their field. Some wrote neatly on lined notepaper, others scrawled on the back of student papers they were marking.

“It became a big part of my life,” Duggan says. “I felt a little bit out of my depth. It took its toll on me and in the end I felt I had to step away. I went into my shell and pretty much turned off my phone for three years.

“But I’ve got some emotional resilience back now. My partner and I found out we’re pregnant – due in August. I don’t want that kid to grow up asking why we didn’t actually do anything.”

So Duggan has returned to his “passion project” – Is This How You Feel – by asking the scientists to write again. Have their feelings changed in the intervening years?

The first 10 return letters are emotional outpourings of despair, hope, fear and determination in the age of the climate crisis, from the people helping the world understand its impacts while also being mums, dads and grandparents.

Since the first letters were written, two Australian correspondents Tony McMichael and Michael Raupach have died. But Duggan is trying to reach their family members to see if they can keep the legacy moving.

Meissner, now director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, didn’t hesitate to respond partly because “it was the right thing to do”.

When these people start to speak up about being frustrated, desperate, worried, angry or scared, then we really should listen very carefully Katrin Meissner

“But also because we have not been very good at communicating climate science to the public and I believe that it is my duty as a citizen to alert people to the urgency of the situation.”

But does Meissner think there’s a risk in scientists lifting their veil of cool objectivity to show their personal feelings? Could it cause some to question their objectivity?

“I actually think that the opposite is the case,” she says. “When I saw the whole collection of letters a few years ago, I was surprised by the number of colleagues who had participated.

“We are talking here about world-leading scientists, people who built their career on facts and data, who are spending their lives questioning every result they find, over and over again. People who are continuously challenging the status quo. People who are trained to be objective.

“When these people start to speak up about their feelings, about being frustrated, desperate, worried, angry or scared, then we really should listen very carefully.”

Duggan wants anyone who has read the letters to write their own, and share them. Here are some excerpts from the latest scientist letters from Duggan’s project.

Prof Katrin Meissner

How do I feel about it? I am still very worried. I am also profoundly sad. I am probably sadder than I was five years ago. I feel powerless and, to a certain extent, guilty. I feel like I have failed my duty as a citizen and as a mother because I was not able to communicate the urgency of the situation well enough to trigger meaningful action in time.



What we are doing right now is an uncontrolled, risky experiment with the planet we live on.

Prof Will Steffen, Australian National University

I’m angry because the lack of effective action on climate change, despite the wealth not only of scientific information but also of solutions to reduce emissions, has now created a climate emergency. The students are right. Their future is now being threatening by the greed of the wealthy fossil fuel elite, the lies of the Murdoch press, and the weakness of our political leaders. These people have no right to destroy my daughter’s future and that of her generation.

Prof Lesley Hughes, pro vice-chancellor, Macquarie University

My emotions haven’t really changed since I last wrote one of these letters, but things around me have. The beacon of light that is Greta Thunberg, speaking truth to power. Our own wonderful, passionate school kids taking to the streets, making me cry with pride.

The only way to cope with all of this is to focus on what I can do, what I’m best at, and hope like hell that enough people, doing what they do best, can overcome. I have some very dark moments, but more than ever before, I feel wrapped in a blanket of collective determination. Hope is a necessary emotion, but more than that, it must be our fundamental strategy to keep us going. Lose it, and we are lost.

Dr Kevin Trenberth, National Centre for Atmospheric Research (US)

For the most part my comments of 19 September 2014 still apply except that the glimmer of hope has diminished if not vanished entirely. With Obama as US president and the Paris agreement in late 2015, a glimmer of hope seemed to emerge, but with Trump and his ignorant accomplices, the hope has vanished. I am close to retirement and as I was cleaning up in 2019 I found some old VHS tapes recording me on shows, such as the Lehrer News Hour on PBS in 1988, and the message then was much the same as now except we are now more confident and the progress has been nil. It was depressing. My solution has been to move back to New Zealand along with my daughter and family (grandchildren).

Dr Roger Bodman, University of Melbourne

Realistically, we are already too late to meet a 1.5 degree target and will struggle to achieve 2 degrees.



So, the future, basically, looks bad. Hard to stay hopeful. Change is too slow, too late.



Yet we have to stay optimistic.

Dr Jennie Mallela, Australian National University

Dear Joe,

​

Climate Change feels very real and I think this summer we reached a tipping point in Australia. As I write this my husband, a bushfire fighter, is battling a fire in Canberra and I’m working from home as a freak hailstorm destroyed my car three days ago. In four days, we’ve been smashed by our climate: hail, extreme winds, toxic smoke and fire. …. So how do I feel? Frustrated, angry that our science is ignored by politicians, scared for my husband and all the others who are on the frontline fighting these fires and trying to help. But mostly I feel devastated for my son, and his generation, who will have to heal this planet and live with the mass environmental destruction we have caused.

Prof Dave Griggs, Monash Sustainable Development Institute

I feel scared for the future when faced with simple downright ignorance from some political leaders.



I feel tired, tired that in spite of bushfires, floods etc I still seem to be banging my head against a brick wall to convince people that the threat of climate change is severe.



I feel relieved that now I am retired I don’t have to live and breathe this every minute of every day.



I feel guilty that I am stepping back from the frontline, so even though I am retired I feel compelled to carry on working.



I feel unspeakable joy at the news that I am to become a grandfather for the first time, but fearful of the world my grandchild will grow up in. I feel relieved that when my grandchild grows up and asks me why we did nothing to stop climate change I can at least say that I did my best.



As I sit writing this on a bench looking out over the moors I feel uplifted that despite everything the world is still the most beautiful place.

Researchers find fans of apocalyptic movies may be coping with pandemic better,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-fans-apocalyptic-movies-coping-pandemic.html,"Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain

A small team of researchers from the University of Chicago, Pennsylvania State University, and Aarhus University has found that people who are exposed to end-of-the-world movies may be more resilient when dealing with the real-life ongoing pandemic. They have written a paper describing questioning volunteers about movies they had seen and their real pandemic experiences. Their paper is availabe on the PsyArXiv preprint server.

The movie industry has been cranking out end-of-the-world type movies for years—from Martians attacks and massive volcanic eruptions to asteroid strikes—and, of course, pandemics killing everyone. Psychologists have been trying to understand why people watch such movies, but have met with little success. In this new effort, the researchers looked at such movies in another way—as preparation for real-life disaster scenarios.

They wondered if watching a movie about an epidemic, such as ""Contagion,"" (2011) starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon, might help people deal with a real-world pandemic. They noted that viewership of ""Contagion"" rose dramatically during the first few months of the coronavirus pandemic. To find out why, and whether watching the movie helped viewers, the researchers turned to Prolific—an online recruitment tool that allows researchers to connect with volunteers virtually. For their study, the researchers queried 126 individuals—notably, each of them was paid for their efforts. The researchers asked them about themselves and whether they were fans of movies in certain genres. They also asked them how they were feeling about the coronavirus and, of course, if they had watched the movie ""Contagion.""

The researchers found that people who had recently watched what they describe as ""prepper"" movies showed signs of higher levels of resilience to the real-world pandemic. They suggest exposure to certain scenes in a movie psychologically prepared viewers for some of the events that unfolded as the real pandemic got underway. They further note that people watching generic horror movies also reported higher levels of coping abilities during the early days of the real pandemic. The researchers suggest such movies allow viewers to practice coping skills, which they apparently put to use if a real need arises.

Average American worker takes less vacation than a medieval peasant,http://www.businessinsider.com/american-worker-less-vacation-medieval-peasant-2016-11?utm_content=bufferb1073&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer-ti,"Life for the medieval peasant was certainly no picnic. His life was shadowed by fear of famine, disease and bursts of warfare. His diet and personal hygiene left much to be desired.

But despite his reputation as a miserable wretch, you might envy him one thing: his vacations.

Plowing and harvesting were backbreaking toil, but the peasant enjoyed anywhere from eight weeks to half the year off.

The Church, mindful of how to keep a population from rebelling, enforced frequent mandatory holidays. Weddings, wakes, and births might mean a week off quaffing ale to celebrate, and when wandering jugglers or sporting events came to town, the peasant expected time off for entertainment. There were labor-free Sundays, and when the plowing and harvesting seasons were over, the peasant got time to rest, too.

In fact, economist Juliet Shor found that during periods of particularly high wages, such as 14th-century England, peasants might put in no more than 150 days a year. As for the modern American worker? After a year on the job, she gets an average of eight vacation days annually.

A history of dwindling vacation days

It wasn't supposed to turn out this way: John Maynard Keynes, one of the founders of modern economics, made a famous prediction that by 2030, advanced societies would be wealthy enough that leisure time, rather than work, would characterize national lifestyles. So far, that forecast is not looking good.

What happened? Some cite the victory of the modern eight-hour a day, 40-hour workweek over the punishing 70 or 80 hours a 19th century worker spent toiling as proof that we're moving in the right direction.

But Americans have long since kissed the 40-hour workweek goodbye, and Shor's examination of work patterns reveals that the 19th century was an aberration in the history of human labor. When workers fought for the eight-hour workday, they weren't trying to get something radical and new, but rather to restore what their ancestors had enjoyed before industrial capitalists and the electric light bulb came on the scene.

Go back 200, 300, or 400 years and you find that most people did not work very long hours at all. In addition to relaxing during long holidays, the medieval peasant took his sweet time eating meals, and the day often included time for an afternoon snooze.

""The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed,"" notes Shor. ""Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure.""

Fast-forward to the 21st century, and the US is the only advanced country with no national vacation policy whatsoever.

Many American workers must keep on working through public holidays, and vacation days often go unused. Even when we finally carve out a holiday, many of us answer emails and ""check in"" whether we're camping with the kids or trying to kick back on the beach.

Some blame the American worker for not taking what is her due. But in a period of consistently high unemployment, job insecurity and weak labor unions, employees may feel no choice but to accept the conditions set by the culture and the individual employer.

In a world of ""at will"" employment, where the work contract can be terminated at any time, it's not easy to raise objections.

It's true that the New Deal brought back some of the conditions that farm workers and artisans from the Middle Ages took for granted, but since the 1980s things have gone steadily downhill. With secure long-term employment slipping away, people jump from job to job, so seniority no longer offers the benefits of additional days off. The rising trend of hourly and part-time work, stoked by the Great Recession, means that for many, the idea of a guaranteed vacation is a dim memory.

The consequences of constantly working

Ironically, this cult of endless toil doesn't really help the bottom line.

Study after study shows that overworking reduces productivity. On the other hand, performance increases after a vacation, and workers come back with restored energy and focus. The longer the vacation, the more relaxed and energized people feel upon returning to the office.

Economic crises give austerity-minded politicians excuses to talk of decreasing time off, increasing the retirement age and cutting into social insurance programs and safety nets that were supposed to allow us a fate better than working until we drop. In Europe, where workers average 25 to 30 days off per year, politicians like French President Francois Hollande and former Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras have sent signals that the culture of longer vacations is coming to an end.

But the belief that shorter vacations bring economic gains doesn't appear to add up.

flickr / Robert S. Donovan According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the Greeks, who face a horrible economy, work more hours than any other Europeans. In Germany, an economic powerhouse, workers rank second to last in number of hours worked. Despite more time off, German workers are the eighth most productive in Europe, while the long-toiling Greeks rank 24 out of 25 in productivity.

Beyond burnout, vanishing vacations make our relationships with families and friends suffer. Our health is deteriorating: depression and higher risk of death are among the outcomes for our no-vacation nation. Some forward-thinking people have tried to reverse this trend, like progressive economist Robert Reich, who has argued in favor of a mandatory three weeks off for all American workers. Congressman Alan Grayson proposed the Paid Vacation Act of 2009, but alas, the bill didn't even make it to the floor of Congress.

Speaking of Congress, its members seem to be the only people in America getting as much down time as the medieval peasant. In recent years, they've gotten upward of 239 days in vacation time."
CO2 in Earth's atmosphere nearing levels of 15m years ago,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/09/co2-in-earths-atmosphere-nearing-levels-of-15m-years-ago,"The amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is approaching a level not seen in 15m years and perhaps never previously experienced by a hominoid, according to the authors of a study.

At pre-lockdown rates of increase, within five years atmospheric CO2 will pass 427 parts per million, which was the probable peak of the mid-Pliocene warming period 3.3m years ago, when temperatures were 3C to 4C hotter and sea levels were 20 metres higher than today.

But it seems we must now go much further back to see what’s ahead.

Some time around 2025, the Earth is likely to have CO2 conditions not experienced since the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum 15m years ago, around the time our ancestors are thought to have diverged from orangutans and become recognisably hominoid.

For the paper published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, a team of researchers from the University of Southampton constructed a new high-resolution record of atmospheric CO2 during the Pliocene using data derived from the boron levels in tiny fossils about the size of a pin head collected from deep ocean sediments of the Caribbean Sea.

This confirmed trends previously observed in ice cores, but also allowed a more precise estimate of the CO2 range in that geological epoch, when levels of solar radiation were the same as today.

“A striking result we’ve found is that the warmest part of the Pliocene had between 380 and 420 parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere,” one of the co-authors Thomas Chalk, said. “This is similar to today’s value of around 415 parts per million, showing that we are already at levels that in the past were associated with temperature and sea-level significantly higher than today.”

“Currently, our CO2 levels are rising at about 2.5 ppm per year, meaning that by 2025 we will have exceeded anything seen in the last 3.3 million years.”

The authors said the study of the past provided a guide to what is likely to happen in the future as the Earth responds to the buildup of greenhouse gas from the past two centuries of industrial emissions.

“Ice sheets today haven’t had a chance to catch up with CO2 forcing. We are burning through the Pliocene and heading towards a Miocene-like future,” said another of the authors, Gavin Foster, a professor of isotope geochemistry at the University of Southampton. “We now have to go further back in time to find situations that are relevant.”

During the Middle Miocene, ice sheets shrank further and sea levels were much higher than the Pliocene. Foster said this was long before anything recognisably human had evolved on Earth.

The steady increase in temperatures in the current era were highlighted on Thursday by a new international collaboration coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization and led by the UK’s Met Office. In the first of what will be an annually annually-updated five-year climate prediction, the scientists noted that there is a 20% chance of the world temporarily reaching 1.5C above pre-industrial levels before 2025.

“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris agreement on climate change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C,” said the WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas."
The Truth Is Paywalled But The Lies Are Free,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/the-truth-is-paywalled-but-the-lies-are-free,"Paywalls are justified, even though they are annoying. It costs money to produce good writing, to run a website, to license photographs. A lot of money, if you want quality. Asking people for a fee to access content is therefore very reasonable. You don’t expect to get a print subscription to the newspaper gratis, why would a website be different? I try not to grumble about having to pay for online content, because I run a magazine and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.

But let us also notice something: the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Washington Post, the New Republic, New York, Harper’s, the New York Review of Books, the Financial Times, and the London Times all have paywalls. Breitbart, Fox News, the Daily Wire, the Federalist, the Washington Examiner, InfoWars: free! You want “Portland Protesters Burn Bibles, American Flags In The Streets,” “The Moral Case Against Mask Mandates And Other COVID Restrictions,” or an article suggesting the National Institutes of Health has admitted 5G phones cause coronavirus—they’re yours. You want the detailed Times reports on neo-Nazis infiltrating German institutions, the reasons contact tracing is failing in U.S. states, or the Trump administration’s undercutting of the USPS’s effectiveness—well, if you’ve clicked around the website a bit you’ll run straight into the paywall. This doesn’t mean the paywall shouldn’t be there. But it does mean that it costs time and money to access a lot of true and important information, while a lot of bullshit is completely free.

Now, crucially, I do not mean to imply here that reading the New York Times gives you a sound grasp of reality. I have documented many times how the Times misleads people, for instance by repeating the dubious idea that we have a “border crisis” of migrants “pouring into” the country or that Russia is trying to “steal” life-saving vaccine research that should be free anyway. But it’s important to understand the problem with the Times: it is not that the facts it reports tend to be inaccurate—though sometimes they are—but that the facts are presented in a way that misleads. There is no single “fact” in the migrant story or the Russia story that I take issue with, what I take issue with is the conclusions that are being drawn from the facts. (Likewise, the headline “U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest For A-Bomb Parts” is technically accurate: the U.S. government did, in fact, say that. It was just not true.) The New York Times is, in fact, extremely valuable, if you read it critically and look past the headlines. Usually the truth is in there somewhere, as there is a great deal of excellent reporting, and one could almost construct a serious newspaper purely from material culled from the New York Times. I’ve written before about the Times’ reporting on Hitler and the Holocaust: it wasn’t that the grim facts of the situation were left out of the paper, but that they were buried at the back and treated as unimportant. It was changes in emphasis that were needed, because the facts were there in black and white.

This means that a lot of the most vital information will end up locked behind the paywall. And while I am not much of a New Yorker fan either, it’s concerning that the Hoover Institute will freely give you Richard Epstein’s infamous article downplaying the threat of coronavirus, but Isaac Chotiner’s interview demolishing Epstein requires a monthly subscription, meaning that the lie is more accessible than its refutation. Eric Levitz of New York is one of the best and most prolific left political commentators we have. But unless you’re a subscriber of New York, you won’t get to hear much of what he has to say each month.

Possibly even worse is the fact that so much academic writing is kept behind vastly more costly paywalls. A white supremacist on YouTube will tell you all about race and IQ but if you want to read a careful scholarly refutation, obtaining a legal PDF from the journal publisher would cost you $14.95, a price nobody in their right mind would pay for one article if they can’t get institutional access. (I recently gave up on trying to access a scholarly article because I could not find a way to get it for less than $39.95, though in that case the article was garbage rather than gold.) Academic publishing is a nightmarish patchwork, with lots of articles advertised at exorbitant fees on one site, and then for free on another, or accessible only through certain databases, which your university or public library may or may not have access to. (Libraries have to budget carefully because subscription prices are often nuts. A library subscription to the Journal of Coordination Chemistry, for instance, costs $11,367 annually.)

Of course, people can find their ways around paywalls. SciHub is a completely illegal but extremely convenient means of obtaining academic research for free. (I am purely describing it, not advocating it.) You can find a free version of the article debunking race and IQ myths on ResearchGate, a site that has engaged in mass copyright infringement in order to make research accessible. Often, because journal publishers tightly control access to their copyrighted work in order to charge those exorbitant fees for PDFs, the versions of articles that you can get for free are drafts that have not yet gone through peer review, and have thus been subjected to less scrutiny. This means that the more reliable an article is, the less accessible it is. On the other hand, pseudo-scholarhip is easy to find. Right-wing think tanks like the Cato Institute, the Foundation for Economic Education, the Hoover Institution, the Mackinac Center, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage Foundation pump out slickly-produced policy documents on every subject under the sun. They are utterly untrustworthy—the conclusion is always going to be “let the free market handle the problem,” no matter what the problem or what the facts of the case. But it is often dressed up to look sober-minded and non-ideological.

It’s not easy or cheap to be an “independent researcher.” When I was writing my first book, Superpredator, I wanted to look through newspaper, magazine, and journal archives to find everything I could about Bill Clinton’s record on race. I was lucky I had a university affiliation, because this gave me access to databases like LexisNexis. If I hadn’t, the cost of finding out what I wanted to find out would likely have run into the thousands of dollars.

A problem beyond cost, though, is convenience. I find that even when I am doing research through databases and my university library, it is often an absolute mess: the sites are clunky and constantly demanding login credentials. The amount of time wasted in figuring out how to obtain a piece of research material is a massive cost on top of the actual pricing. The federal court document database, PACER, for instance, charges 10 cents a page for access to records, which adds up quickly since legal research often involves looking through thousands of pages. They offer an exemption if you are a researcher or can’t afford it, but to get the exemption you have to fill out a three page form and provide an explanation of both why you need each document and why you deserve the exemption. This is a waste of time that inhibits people’s productivity and limits their access to knowledge.

In fact, to see just how much human potential is being squandered by having knowledge dispensed by the “free market,” let us briefly picture what “totally democratic and accessible knowledge” would look like. Let’s imagine that instead of having to use privatized research services like Google Scholar and EBSCO, there was a single public search database containing every newspaper article, every magazine article, every academic journal article, every court record, every government document, every website, every piece of software, every film, song, photograph, television show, and video clip, and every book in existence. The content of the Wayback Machine, all of the newspaper archives, Google Books, Getty Images, Project Gutenberg, Spotify, the Library of Congress, everything in WestLaw and Lexis, all of it, every piece of it accessible instantly in full, and with a search function designed to be as simple as possible and allow you to quickly narrow down what you are looking for. (e.g. “Give me: all Massachusetts newspaper articles, books published in Boston, and government documents that mention William Lloyd Garrison and were published from 1860 to 1865.”) The true universal search, uncorrupted by paid advertising. Within a second, you could bring up an entire PDF of any book. Within two seconds, you could search the full contents of that book.

Let us imagine just how much time would be saved in this informational utopia. Do I want minute 15 of the 1962 Czechoslovak film Man In Outer Space? Four seconds from my thought until it begins. Do I want page 17 of the Daily Mirror from 1985? Even less time. Every public Defense Department document concerning Vietnam from the Eisenhower administration? Page 150 of Frank Capra’s autobiography? Page 400 of an economics textbook from 1995? All in front of me, in full, in less than the length of time it takes to type this sentence. How much faster would research be in such a situation? How much more could be accomplished if knowledge were not fragmented and in the possession of a thousand private gatekeepers?

What’s amazing is that the difficulty of creating this situation of “fully democratized information” is entirely economic rather than technological. What I describe with books is close to what Google Books and Amazon already have. But of course, universal free access to full content horrifies publishers, so we are prohibited from using these systems to their full potential. The problem is ownership: nobody is allowed to build a giant free database of everything human beings have ever produced. Getty Images will sue the shit out of you if you take a historical picture from their archives and violate your licensing agreement with them. Same with the Walt Disney Company if you create a free rival to Disney+ with all of their movies. Sci-Hub was founded in Kazakhstan because if you founded it here they would swiftly put you in federal prison. (When you really think about what it means, copyright law is an unbelievably intensive restriction on freedom of speech, sharply delineating the boundaries of what information can and cannot be shared with other people.)

But it’s not just profiteering companies that will fight to the death to keep content safely locked up. The creators of content are horrified by piracy, too. As my colleagues Lyta Gold and Brianna Rennix write, writers, artists, and filmmakers can be justifiably concerned that unless ideas and writings and images can be regarded as “property,” they will starve to death:

Is there a justifiable rationale for treating ideas—and particularly stories—as a form of “property”? One obvious reason for doing so is to ensure that writers and other creators don’t starve to death: In our present-day capitalist utopia, if a writer’s output can be brazenly copied and profited upon by others, they won’t have any meaningful ability to make a living off their work, especially if they’re an independent creator without any kind of institutional affiliation or preexisting wealth.

Lyta and Brianna point out that in the real world, this justification is often bullshit, because copyrights last well beyond the death of the person who actually made the thing. But it’s a genuine worry, because there is no “universal basic income” for a writer to fall back on in this country if their works are simply passed around from hand to hand without anybody paying for them. I admit I bristle when I see people share PDFs of full issues of Current Affairs, because if this happened a lot, we could sell exactly 1 subscription and then the issue could just be copied indefinitely. Current Affairs would collapse completely if everyone tried to get our content for free rather than paying for it. (This is why you should subscribe! Or donate! Independent media needs your support!)

At the end of last year, I published a book on socialism, and at first some conservatives thought it funny to ask me “if you’re a socialist, can I have it for free?” They were quieted, though, when I pointed out that yes, they could indeed have it for free. All they needed to do was go to the local socialized information repository known as a public library, where they would be handed a copy of the book without having to fork over a nickel. Anyone who wants to read my book but cannot or does not want to pay for it has an easy solution.

I realized, though, as I was recommending everyone get my book from the library rather than buying it in a bookstore, that my publisher probably didn’t appreciate my handing out this advice. And frankly, it made me a little nervous: I depend for my living on my writing, so if everyone got my book from the library, it wouldn’t sell any copies, and then my publisher wouldn’t pay me to write any more books. We can’t have too many people using the socialized information repository when authors are reliant on a capitalist publishing industry! In fact, a strange thing about the library is that we intentionally preserve an unnecessary inefficiency in order to keep the current content financing model afloat. Your library could just give you DRM-free PDFs of my book and every issue of Current Affairs for free, but instead they make you go to the magazine room or check out one of a limited number of copies of the book, because while we want books and magazines to be free, we cannot have them be as free as it is possible to make them, or it would hurt the publishing industry too much. (Libraries preserve the fiction that there are a select number of “copies” available of a digital book, even though this is ludicrous, because abandoning the fiction would hurt publishers. They could offer every book ever written to anyone at any time. They just can’t do it legally.)

I also realized, however, that I wouldn’t care how many people got my book for free if my compensation operated on a different structure, where I was paid by the number of people who read it rather than the number of people who bought it. “Impossible!” you say. “Where would the money come from?” We can imagine such a set-up quite easily, though. We have our universal public knowledge database, and anyone who wants to can type in the title of any of my books and read them for free.** But the number of people who read the book is tracked, and I am compensated two dollars for every person who reads it (a pittance, but that’s about what authors get for their sales). Current Affairs, likewise, is granted a budget proportional to its readership. Compensated from where? Budget from where? Why, from the universal public knowledge database of course. But from where do they get their money? Why, from taxes.* Free at point of use services are not some alien concept. The NHS compensates doctors while charging patients nothing. (Of course, compensation for producers wouldn’t even be that much of an issue in a society with a Universal Basic Income and where the basics of life were guaranteed. I wouldn’t care about making any money on my books if I could live decently regardless.)

Now, I am sure there will be those who argue that any universal knowledge access system of this kind will inhibit the creation of new work by reducing the rewards people get. But let us note a few facts: first, dead people cannot be incentivized to be creative, thus at least everything ever created by a person who is now dead should be made freely available to all. The gatekeepers to intellectual products made by the dead are parasites the equivalent of a private individual who sets up a gate and a tollbooth in the middle of a road somebody else has already built and starts charging people if they want to pass. Actually, since parasites latch onto the living, they are better compared with corpse-eating worms.

Second, creators are already exploited: Spotify is very much like the universal searchable information database for music, it just operates for profit rather than for artists, and rights-holders get a fraction of a cent per Spotify play, an amount that must itself split between the label, the producer, the artist, and the songwriter. The CEO of Spotify has said that if artists want more money, they should make more music. (He is worth $4 billion.) And if you ever want to make a professor laugh, ask how much they make from royalties on their published academic articles. As Adam Habib, Vice-Chancellor for research at the University of Johannesburg explains, academic publishing is a “completely feudal system”:

“The costs of the research production are borne by the universities, and as a result, by public monies, in most cases. Then, private companies publish the research, and charge the universities and public institutions for the very research outputs that they paid for. This is effectively the subsidy of the private sector by public money. There is a myth that this is an example of entrepreneurialism. In my view, all it does is facilitate enrichment at public cost with huge consequences for those most disadvantaged.”

This problem has not been fixed by the rise of “open-access” scholarship, because it hasn’t removed the profit motive, so poor countries are still getting screwed by the existing publishing model.

Third, when considering the free information repository’s effects on content creation, you cannot look only at one side of the equation. The question of how much productivity would be inhibited by the state declining to enforce the copyrights of academic journal publishers and Getty Images must be weighed against the phenomenal unleashing of human productive power that universal free access to all human knowledge would create. You must add up how much researchers could do with the time that they now have to spend trying to track down and access things. No more would a certain thing only be in a certain library and accessible through an inter-library loan request. No more would librarians have to spend any time managing subscriptions rather than helping with searches. Researchers in the developing world would no longer be utterly unable to compete with American libraries that can afford vast fees. (I can tell you, personally, that as someone who is constantly having to find obscure used books for research and then order them and wait sometimes weeks for them to arrive, I could produce far more quickly if I could see the full content of the book in ten seconds, and I am constantly exasperated by Google Books’ “snippet view.”)

Furthermore, we would have to consider what would happen in a society where the relative accessibility and cost of truth versus lies was adjusted. What if every online course was free? What if textbooks cost nothing instead of $200? What if we made it as easy and cheap as possible to find things out and were guided by the desire to create the greatest possible access to knowledge rather than by economic considerations? I do not know what would happen, but I hope some rogue state (or microstate or seastead) that doesn’t mind pissing off the world’s most powerful corporations and governments tries to storm the Bastille of information and free every bit and byte from its artificial prison. The only thing stopping them is law, and what is law but a threat?

The good news about our times is that the possibilities for democratizing knowledge are greater than ever. We could not have started Current Affairs in 1990 unless we had about ten times more money than what we actually had. Sharp left YouTubers are fighting hard to combat propaganda and debunk bad arguments, there are tons of great podcasts, and even Twitter has its uses. (Where else do you get to yell at powerful and influential people and personally tick them off?) But it is still true that Fox News and PragerU and the American Enterprise Institute have a hell of a lot of money to blast out their message as widely as possible. There is nothing on the left of remotely comparable size and influence.

But we are working on it. We are a long way from the world in which all knowledge is equally accessible. Hopefully someday our patchwork of intentionally-inefficient libraries will turn into a free storehouse of humanity’s recorded knowledge and creativity. In the meantime, however, we need to focus on getting good and thoughtful material in as many hands as possible and breaking down the barriers we can. At Current Affairs we have no paywall, even though this might cost us some money, because we are trying to make it as easy as possible to hear what we have to say. This is what the right does. They tell people what to think, offer them books and pamphlets and handy five-minute YouTube videos. On the left we are not nearly as slick.

We can’t afford to keep our reach to those who like us so much that they are willing to pay money to listen, because then the free bullshit wins. It’s hard for small media institutions to figure out the right balance of depending on ads, paywalls, and donations. The money has to come from somewhere, after all. A lot of the times, that means a heavy dependence on ads—the traditional model of magazines has been ad-revenue based, not subscription-based—so that paywalls are actually the less corrupted model; a podcaster who sells their product on Patreon rather than giving it away but filling it with mattress and “box-of-shit-a-month” ads has an important kind of freedom: they only have to please the audience, not the sponsors. At Current Affairs, we sell subscriptions to keep the lights on, but even one person who could have read an article and doesn’t is a loss. (I wish I could give my book to everyone too but my publisher won’t let me. I did make another one free, though.) The Guardian and the Intercept provide a lot of valuable material to the public for free because they don’t have paywalls, but the Guardian is funded by a trust and the Intercept by a benevolent billionaire. (Such funding sources make things much easier. Attention benevolent billionaires: we have a donate page.) Perhaps paywalls can help publications like the New York Times and the New Statesman from having to partner with “branded content” suppliers like Shell Oil and Cigna, but at the expense of limiting reach. More reason to have publications funded by the centralized free-information library rather than through subscriptions or corporate sponsorship.

Creators must be compensated well. But at the same time we have to try to keep things that are important and profound from getting locked away where few people will see them. The truth needs to be free and universal.

* I will not be reading angry emails from Modern Monetary Theorists. I am assuming a country without a sovereign currency, so there.

** You could, of course—and I am sure many people would want to—offer the universal database with a paywall and something like an “allowance” each month (e.g. 5 books, 100 newspaper/magazine articles, 50 scholarly journal articles, 20 films, and as many court records as they like) above which there would be a cost, and waive that cost for anyone below a certain income level. But this would involve means-testing, which makes everything needlessly complicated and inevitably means that some people will not access things who otherwise would.

"Next generation climate models show the ""middle of the road"" scenario is equal to the old worst-case scenario. The climate system is more sensitive to CO2 than previously forecast.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/cmip6-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-explained,"Climate models are one of the primary means for scientists to understand how the climate has changed in the past and may change in the future. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans in great detail, and require some of the largest supercomputers in the world to generate their climate projections.

Climate models are constantly being updated, as different modelling groups around the world incorporate higher spatial resolution, new physical processes and biogeochemical cycles. These modelling groups coordinate their updates around the schedule of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports, releasing a set of model results – known as “runs” – in the lead-up to each one.

These coordinated efforts are part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP). The 2013 IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5) featured climate models from CMIP5, while the upcoming 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report (AR6) will feature new state-of-the-art CMIP6 models.

CMIP6 will consist of the “runs” from around 100 distinct climate models being produced across 49 different modelling groups. The effort is already a year behind schedule, and it appears increasingly unlikely that all the CMIP6 models will be available in time for inclusion in the AR6.

Enough data is now available for Carbon Brief to produce an initial assessment of how things have changed since CMIP5. These models are running a number of new and updated emission pathways that explore a much wider range of possible future outcomes than were included in CMIP5.

While the results from only around 40 CMIP6 models have been published so far, it is already evident that a number of them have a notably higher climate sensitivity than models in CMIP5. This higher sensitivity contributes to projections of greater warming this century – around 0.4C to 0.9C warmer than similar scenarios run in CMIP5 – though these warming projections may change as more models become available. Researchers are still working to assess why sensitivity values appear higher in the latest generation of models.

In this explainer, Carbon Brief provides an overview of the future emissions scenarios that are being used in CMIP6. This includes an examination of the climate sensitivity, past and future warming in CMIP6 models released so far, and a look at how they compare with the prior generation of models in CMIP5. Finally, this article will summarise the different experiments that climate models are undertaking in CMIP6.

Update 17 June 2020: This article has been updated to include more model sensitivity estimates, as well as a new section about the latest studies looking at the reliability of higher sensitivity models.

Future emission scenarios

CMIP6 represents a substantial expansion over CMIP5, in terms of the number of modelling groups participating, the number of future scenarios examined and the number of different experiments conducted.

The goal of CMIP is to generate a set of standard simulations that each model will run. This allows results to be directly comparable across different models, to see where models agree and disagree on future changes. One of the main sets of simulations run by models are future climate scenarios, where models are given a common set of future concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate forcings to project what might happen in the future.

In the lead up to the IPCC AR6, the energy modelling community has developed a new set of emissions scenarios driven by different socioeconomic assumptions, These are the “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways” (SSPs). A number of these SSP scenarios have been selected to drive climate models for CMIP6.

Specifically, a set of scenarios were chosen to provide a range of distinct end-of-century climate change outcomes. The IPCC AR5 featured four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that examined different possible future greenhouse gas emissions. These scenarios – RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 – have new versions in CMIP6. These updated scenarios are called SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5, each of which result in similar 2100 radiative forcing levels as their predecessor in AR5.

A number of new scenarios are also being used for CMIP6 in order to give a wider selection of futures for scientists to simulate. These scenarios are included in the chart below, which shows the annual CO2 emissions assumed under each scenario out to 2100. The new scenarios include SSP1-1.9 (purple line), SSP4-3.4 (blue solid), SSP5-3.4OS (blue dashed) and SSP3-7.0 (orange).

Future CO2 emissions scenarios featured in CMIP6, as well as historical CO2 emissions (in black). The shaded area represents the range of no-policy baseline scenarios . Data from the SSP database ; chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

One major improvement to CMIP6 scenarios is a better exploration of possible baseline “no climate policy” outcomes. The prior generation of climate models featured in CMIP5 only included one very high baseline scenario (RCP8.5) and one relatively little-mitigation scenario consistent with baseline outcomes (RCP6.0). Much of the subsequent literature relied on RCP8.5 as the only no-policy baseline, often referring to it as “business as usual” despite it being somewhat of a worst-case among possible no-policy outcomes.

CMIP6 has added a new scenario – SSP3-7.0 – which lies right in the middle of the range of baseline outcomes produced by energy system models. Now modellers can examine worst case (SSP5-8.5), middle of the road (SSP3-7.0) and more optimistic (SSP4-6.0) outcomes when modelling how the world might warm in a world that fails to enact any climate policies.

SSP4-3.4 is another new scenario that tries to explore the space between scenarios that generally limit warming to below 2C (RCP2.6 / SSP1-2.6) and around 3C (RCP4.5 / SSP2-4.5) by 2100. It will help scientists better assess the impacts of warming if societies rapidly reduce emissions, but fail to mitigate fast enough to limit warming to below 2C.

SSP5-3.4OS is an overshoot scenario (OS) where emissions follow a worst-case SSP5-8.5 pathway until 2040, after which they decline extremely rapidly with lot of late-century use of negative emissions.

Finally, SSP1-1.9 is a scenario intended to limit warming to below 1.5C by 2100 above pre-industrial levels. It was added in the aftermath of the Paris Agreement when countries agreed to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. The energy models and simple climate models developed to limit warming to 1.5C played a big role in the special report on 1.5C that the IPCC published in 2018. These new CMIP6 scenarios will now allow full climate models to explore climate changes and impacts at around 1.5C warming.

CMIP6 features new scenarios that result in 2100 forcing similar to the CMIP5 RCP scenarios. However, even though their end-of-century forcing is the same, the emissions pathways and mix of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions are different. The figure below compares the CO2 emissions in the old RCP scenarios (dashed lines) and their new SSP counterparts (solid lines).

Future RCP CO2 emissions scenarios featured in CMIP5 and their CMIP6 counterparts, as well as historical CO2 emissions (in black). Data from the SSP database ; chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

There are several reasons for these differences. The new SSP scenarios start in 2014, while the old RCPs started in 2007. The low-end SSP1-2.6 scenario shows a more gradual decline in emissions than RCP2.6 and a higher starting point, reflecting in part that 2007-2014 emissions have been notably higher than expected in the original RCP2.6 scenario. It employs substantially more late-century negative emissions to make up for the higher starting point and slower decline.

SSP2-4.5 also shows a higher starting point and slightly slower decline than RCP4.5, though larger non-CO2 emission declines in SSP2-4.5 also play a role. SSP4-6.0 is quite different from RCP6.0, with CO2 emissions peaking and declining after 2050 compared to 2080. This faster mitigation offsets higher near-term emissions, though emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 also play a role. Finally, SSP5-8.5 has substantially higher CO2 emissions than RCP8.5, with correspondingly larger cuts in non-CO2 emissions.

Many higher sensitivity models

Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the expected long-term warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It is one of the most important indicators of how severe the impacts of future warming will be. “Sensitivity” is something that emerges from the physical and biogeochemical simulations within climate models; it is not something that is explicitly set by modellers.

CMIP6 models available to-date have tended to show notably higher climate sensitivity than CMIP5 models. While only 40 CMIP6 models currently have the runs needed to calculate ECS, around a third of those have an ECS higher than the upper end of the likely range – 1.5C to 4.5C – provided in the IPCC AR5. A quarter have a higher sensitivity than any of the models featured in CMIP5. These include models from a number of very prominent modeling groups – like the Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2) and the Met Office HadGEM3 model. The transient climate response – a measure of shorter-term warming associated with increasing CO2 – is also notably higher in many CMIP6 models.

The figure below shows the IPCC AR5 likely ECS range (black bar), the range and individual values for CMIP5 models (grey bar; black dots), as well as the range and values of CMIP6 models available to-date (blue bar; black dots).

Likely ECS range (e.g. with an estimated 66% chance of occuring) from the IPCC AR5 (black bar), CMIP5 model ECS values (grey), and CMIP6 model ECS values (blue). Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Researchers are currently looking into what is driving these high ECS values. In a number of models the increase in ECS appears to be due to their improved representation of clouds and aerosols; for example, how models treat supercooled clouds (below freezing but still liquid) in the Southern oceans can make a big difference in resulting sensitivity.

However, despite making the models more realistic, it is not yet clear whether these improvements are translating into more accurate estimates of ECS. For example, a number of climate scientists have expressed scepticism of the high-end values, arguing that they are inconsistent with evidence from palaeoclimate records and other lines of evidence.

It remains to be seen how the IPCC AR6 will reconcile the high ECS from some models with other sources of evidence, and if they will update the “likely” sensitivity range.

The ECS values for each of the 40 CMIP6 models available so far are shown in the figure below. Fourteen of these, highlighted in yellow, have an ECS above 4.5C, and eleven of these have sensitivities above that of the highest model in CMIP5 (e.g. 4.7C). Twenty six models have ECS values consistent with the AR5 range, with the lowest ECS model in CMIP6 (1.8C) similar to the lowest in CMIP5 (2.1C).

ECS values from the 40 CMIP6 models available as of May 2020 where necessary experiments to calculate ECS (using the Gregory method ) are currently available. Models with an ECS above the IPCC AR5 likely range are shown in yellow. Note that not all models shown are independent, as some modeling groups – such as CESM2 – have multiple versions. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

AR5’s “likely” ECS range of 1.5C-4.5C means that there is a 66% chance that the true value falls in that range. Therefore, around 33% of values can be expected to fall outside this range – and there are good reasons to expect that values higher than 4.5C are more likely than values below 1.5C. For example, evidence from palaeoclimate data, models, and observations all suggests that an ECS of under 1.5C is unlikely, while they do not as easily rule out an ECS of above 4.5C.

Having a diverse range of ECS values in CMIP6 is not necessarily a bad thing, as it indicates that modellers are not making choices to make their results similar to those of other modeling groups (e.g. fitting in with the herd). However, the fact that a number of models available so far have a very high ECS means either future warming may be worse than we thought or a number of prominent climate models may be getting climate sensitivity wrong, a question that many climate scientists are focusing on resolving.

Latest studies

Recently, a number of studies have tried to address the reliability of higher sensitivity models. Two studies – one by Femke Nijsse and colleagues at the University of Exeter and another by Dr Katarzyna Tokarska and colleagues at ETH Zurich – point out that the highest sensitivity models do a poor job of reproducing historical temperatures, either showing no 20th-century warming and too-rapid recent warming, or too much overall warming. They suggest that historical temperatures can serve as an emergent constraint to help rule out the new very-high sensitivity estimates.

On the other hand, some researchers have argued that natural variability has helped produce a pattern of warming in recent years that leads to lower global temperatures than would otherwise have occurred, making it challenging to use observed warming to constrain future projections.

A recent study by Dr Keith Williams and colleagues at the UK Met Office suggested that the latest Met Office model – which has a sensitivity of 5.5C per doubling CO2 – performs much better in producing short-term forecasts than variants of the model with a lower climate sensitivity as it has greater amounts of cloud liquid water at cold temperatures.

However, as NASA’s Dr Gavin Schmidt points out in a RealClimate blog post, it is still unclear why short-term forecasts should necessarily be linked to sensitivity. Schmidt suggests that “it may be that all models that do well on this task [short-term forecasts] have a range of ECS values, and that the coincidence of this one model doing well and having a high ECS, was just that, a coincidence”.

These new high-sensitivity models are a reminder that large uncertainties (and long tails of risk) remain, but climate models are just one of many lines of evidence that scientists use to determine the sensitivity of the climate. Given the range of new model sensitivity estimates, scientists suggest that it is still premature to say that climate sensitivity is likely higher than previously thought.

CMIP6 historical simulations

With CMIP6 running well behind schedule, only 15 different models of the eventual 100 or so have so far submitted future emissions scenario runs. While results may change as other modelling groups finish, there are enough models available to provide an initial assessment of how CMIP6 will likely turn out compared to CMIP5.

It appears increasingly likely that not all CMIP6 runs will be available by the October 2020 deadline to be included in the final IPCC report, due to be published in April 2021. However, CMIP6 runs not ready in time for the AR6 will still be used by researchers in the future.

While climate models output comprises thousands of different climate variables, a lot of attention is focused on global surface temperatures. Two different experiments that examine surface temperatures are of particular interest: the model surface temperature “hindcast” – where modellers simulate the period from 1850 through to the present day – and the projections of future warming under different emission scenarios.

Hindcasts are a useful tool for modellers to assess the performance of climate models. When models do a good job of representing past changes, it can instill confidence that they will get future changes correct as well.

Climate models cannot resolve all the small scale physics of the Earth’s climate given the limitations of computing power available today. In some cases they have to provide values for processes that occur at too small a scale to effectively simulate – such as cloud formation. The choice of these values – which often are themselves highly uncertain – is known as model tuning. While most modellers avoid explicitly tuning their models to match past temperature changes, when large mismatches are discovered it may send them scrambling to find a fix. In CMIP6, a few modelling groups explicitly tune some parameters to better match historical temperatures – though most still do not.

The figure below shows the global surface temperature “hindcast” from climate models in both CMIP6 (blue) and CMIP5 (grey) compared to observations from the NASA GISTEMP dataset. Lines show the average of the 15 CMIP6 models currently available that provide hindcasts, while the shaded area shows the 95% confidence interval of model runs. This is a smaller number of models than the 31 that have estimated ECS values, as not all of those models have completed their historical simulations.

Observed temperatures compared to CMIP5 and CMIP5 hindcasts. CMIP6 model historical runs from 1850-2014 are combined with mean projections through 2019 across all available scenarios. One run is used per model. Solid lines show the multi-model mean, while the shaded areas represent the two-sigma range. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Despite the changes to ECS values in CMIP6, the hindcast is quite similar to that of CMIP5; observations are nearly always within the range of model runs and models capture modern warming reasonable well. CMIP6 models do not do a particularly good job simulating more-modest early 20th century warming observed from 1900-1940, though in this respect they are similar to CMIP5.

One way to evaluate hindcast performance is to compare the rate of warming in models and observations over a period of time. The figure below shows the rate of warming in observations (from NASA), CMIP5 models and CMIP6 models for both the full 1880-2019 period (left), and the more modern 1970-2019 period (right). This analysis starts in 1880 because the observational record used does not extend all the way back to 1850. The labelled dots represents the average of all the models (the “multi-model mean”), while the uncertainty (blue lines) reflects the range of warming across all the models (or the uncertainty in rate of warming of the observations).

Observed, CMIP5 and CMIP6 rates of warming for the 1880-2019 and 1970-2019 periods. The dot represents the central trend estimate for observations and the multi-model mean for CMIP5 and CMIP6. The uncertainty range reflects the statistical uncertainty of the observations and the 95% range of trends across all the models. Note that models show global mean surface air temperatures, while observations are a mix of surface air temperatures over land and sea surface temperatures over the ocean. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

Over the full 1880-2019 period, both CMIP5 and CMIP6 match the observed rate of warming. Over the more recent 1970-2019 period, the multi-model mean in CMIP5 is warming 10% faster than observations, while the multi-model mean of the subset of CMIP6 models available so far is warming around 20% faster than observations. This higher warming rate in CMIP6 may be driven by the higher model sensitivity values.

Future warming in CMIP6

The limited number of future projections available in CMIP6 means that the collective results may change as more model runs come in. Nevertheless, an initial assessment of the level of future warming in the models available today is still possible. While the average of all the models will change as more results are available, it is clear that the range of values warming in CMIP6 will be notable wider than in CMIP5.

The figure below shows the range of warming and multi-model mean warming – from pre-industrial levels to 2090-2100 – for each of the future scenarios examined in CMIP6 (except the SSP5-3.4OS scenario). The numbers in brackets show how many modelling groups have currently submitted model runs for each scenario.

The range reflects the lowest and highest warming among models for each scenario, while the labeled dot show the multi-model mean. The number in parenthesis on the x-axis represents the number of unique model runs currently available. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts

The results so far are show large amounts of future warming; the new SSP1-1.9 scenario – intended to limit warming to 1.5C – has a multi-model mean warming of 1.6C. Similarly, the SSP1-2.6 scenario – which is analogous to the “well-below 2C” RCP2.6 of AR5 – shows mean warming of 2.1C. On the high end, the SSP5-8.5 scenario shows a mean warming of 5.5C, while the new SSP3-7.0 scenario shows 4.5C of warming.

Some future scenarios have relatively few runs available so far, so the initial values should be treated with caution (particularly for the multi-model mean) until more models finish their runs. Even those such as SSP2-4.5 – with 14 models reporting results – may change notably once the remaining models finish their runs and are added to the CMIP6 database.

The results so far differ fairly substantially from those found in CMIP5 for similar forcing scenarios. The figure below compares warming from pre-industrial levels between similar scenarios in CMIP5 and CMIP6.

While RCP2.6 had a multi-model mean estimate of 1.7C warming in CMIP5, the new SSP1-2.6 scenario has an average warming of 2.1C. Similar differences are found for the other scenarios, with CMIP6 variants showing between 0.4C and 1.1C more warming. Interestingly, the new SSP3-7.0 scenario shows a similar amount of warming – 4.5C – as the old RCP8.5 scenario – 4.6C – reflecting the higher sensitivity of the CMIP6 models published so far. Differences between RCP and new SSP scenarios also have a slight effect on end-of-century warming.

More models and experiments

Experiments in CMIP6 include basic “diagnostic” simulations (called DECK) where CO2 is increased by 1% per year, or suddenly quadrupled, or where the climate forcings are left relatively unchanged for long periods of time. These include historical runs driven by observed changes in CO2 and other climate forcings, and future emissions scenarios through the 21st century and beyond.

In addition, there are 22 specialised experiments (23 including future emissions scenarios) that modelling groups can choose to participate in. These experiments – called Model Intercomparison Projects, or MIPs – provide useful assessments of changes to the climate beyond those in the basic diagnostics and historical simulations. For example, in the GeoMIP experiment, different modelling groups simulate the effect of different types of geoengineering on the climate. The MIPs included in CMIP6 are shown in the figure below.

Not all modelling groups will participate in all MIP experiments in CMIP6 – in part because not all groups have the same level of supercomputing resources or interest in particular experiments. The MIPs included in CMIP6 are listed below; details about each can be found in the accompanying links.

There are 49 different modelling groups participating in CMIP6, up from around two dozen in CMIP5. The map below shows the location of the modelling groups participating in CMIP6.

The output that each modelling centre produces for CMIP6 is loaded on a central web portal, managed by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), which scientists across many disciplines and from all over the world can then freely and openly access. There is also a special issue of the journal Geoscientific Model Development on CMIP6, with 28 published papers covering the overall project and the specific MIPs.

CMIP6 is a huge modelling effort, substantially more ambitious than CMIP5. This has led to some delays, with CMIP6 currently running at least a year behind schedule. While the IPCC AR6 is currently being drafted, only a relatively limited set of models are available, and it seems unlikely that all CMIP6 runs will be completed in time for the final AR6 draft.

"Canada Declares Climate Emergency, Then Approves Massive Oil Pipeline Expansion",https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/wjvkqq/canada-justin-trudeau-declares-climate-emergency-then-approves-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion,"Here's Justin Trudeau just the other week announcing something nice for the environment. Image via The Canadian Press

Only one day after declaring a climate emergency, Canada has approved the expansion of a massive pipeline that will increase oil production in Alberta and release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

On Monday night, Canada’s parliament passed a motion brought forward by Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna calling climate change a “real and urgent crisis, driven by human activity,” and requiring the government to make deep emissions reductions to meet its Paris commitments.

On Tuesday, in a move condemned by environmentalists, Justin Trudeau’s cabinet approved the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX).

Trudeau said he was elected on a plan to grow the middle class and fight climate change, two goals he said were not at odds. “We need to create wealth today so we can invest in the future,” he said.

“This project has the potential to create thousands of solid middle class jobs for Canadians,” he said.

Trudeau made a commitment that every dollar earned from the expansion project will be invested in Canada’s transition to green energy. A senior official said that amounts to about $500 million per year once oil starts flowing through the pipeline.

The project will proceed subject to 156 binding conditions from the regulator, the National Energy Board.

All 129 First Nations along the pipeline route will receive invitations later this week to join a government engagement process toward their “economic participation” in the project, a senior official said.

In response, First Nations leaders in B.C. reiterated their opposition to the project. Tsleil Waututh community member Will George said in a statement, ""No matter who approves it, this pipeline will not be built."" Pipeline opponents promised to ""occupy the highway"" this Saturday.

Construction will start in 2019, but an exact timeline will depend on permits, according to a senior official.

“The timing is ironic for sure,” said Cat Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network. “We’re continuing to have a conversation about addressing climate change in Canada while skirting around the elephant in the room, which is emissions from oil and gas.”

It’s not yet possible to say whether Canada will or won’t meet our Paris commitments, but the government’s own numbers show that we’re 79 megatons of greenhouse gases away from our 2030 emissions reductions targets. It’s a “significant gap,” Abreu said. “And that gap is, according to the modeling, in large part thanks to emissions from the oil and gas sector.” She said Canada will have a hard time meeting its Paris targets “without seriously addressing emissions from the oil and gas sector.”

Cabinet’s approval of the expansion will mean new jobs in pipeline construction, plus heated protests along the route in B.C., and a flurry of fresh legal challenges against the government. It will also allow Trudeau to enter the fall election saying he found a way to export Alberta oil from the west coast, where it can potentially fetch a higher price. The project would increase the capacity of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline from 300,000 barrels of bitumen per day to 890,000.

It’s the second time Trudeau has approved the expansion.

He first gave it the green light in November 2016, but last August a Federal Court of Appeal decision quashed that approval, ruling that the government failed to properly consult First Nations along the pipeline route, and the National Energy Board, the regulator, made a “critical error” in excluding marine tanker traffic from its review. In response, the government launched new consultations with First Nations, and the NEB released a report finding that marine traffic would have “significant” negative effects on killer whales, but concluded it should go ahead anyway.

According to a Crown consultation report released Tuesday, the government has promised to accommodate First Nations by enhancing spill prevention, ensuring quieter vessels, and monitoring cumulative effects, among other measures. The report concludes the government met its duty to consult, as set out by the Federal Court of Appeal. In a letter released Tuesday, former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci, who oversaw the consultations, said they had reinforced his hope for “fair and equitable reconciliation.”

Pipeline worker Tyler Moss said pipeline construction business is already “busy busy” and he’s turning down jobs. Even without the expansion, there are new liquefied natural gas projects to build in northern B.C. But he said he wants the expansion to go forward for the “overall health” of the oil and gas sector.

“TMX is still a huge project and if it does [get approved] I’d be happy to work in the mountains for one of the bigger outfits.”

As for the looming climate crisis, Moss said the shift toward green energy can’t happen overnight. “If our country has money from our resources, we’ve got better options for investing in green energy.”

“That’s like saying we need to keep selling cigarettes to have money to fight cancer,” said Eugene Kung, lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law, and lead on the First Nations case against the pipeline.

Kung said he and other lawyers plan to review cabinet’s rationale, looking for opportunities to challenge it in court. New legal challenges may not stop the pipeline completely, but they could delay it enough that it becomes financially difficult to justify building, he said.

“It could be a stranded asset long before it’s paid off,” Kung said, pointing to a recent Bank of Canada review that identified climate change as a vulnerability to our financial system, posing both physical risks from extreme weather events and transition risks from adapting to a lower-carbon global economy.

The question of whether there’s actually a business case for the expansion has hung over the project since Canada officially bought it last August for $4.5 billion.On June 11, a former Liberal environment minister sent letters to six members of Trudeau’s cabinet saying the expansion has no business case. “There is no credible evidence to suggest that Asia is likely to be a reliable or a significant market for Alberta bitumen,” David Anderson wrote, according to the Canadian Press.

“I don’t think of it as a business case,” said Trevor Tombe, associate economics professor at the University of Calgary. “Pipelines, once they’re constructed, are really boring assets.” They’re like a utility, with a regulated rate of return from one year to the next, he said.

“The question is only whether they will be utilized at sufficient capacity to recoup the construction cost,” he said. “In this case, the projections for Alberta oil are such that there’s little doubt that the oil will be shipped if the pipeline is built, so in that sense, there will be a return on the dollars invested in the pipe.”

On the other hand, the case for public ownership is weak, he said. The government only bought the pipeline under enormous pressure from the previous owner, Kinder Morgan, which had threatened to pull out in the face of court challenges and regulatory hurdles.

Trudeau has been clear that the government plans to sell the pipeline. Tombe said it’ll be easy to sell it once it’s built, but it’s not clear if it will fetch a high enough price to recoup various costs including construction. “Time will tell,” he said.

Meanwhile, along the pipeline route in B.C., some First Nations groups are preparing to fight construction on the ground.

Kanahus Manuel of the Secwepemc Women’s Warrior Society sent a video showing four tiny houses parked along a highway near the site of a proposed “man camp,” where workers building the pipeline will live. She contends the pipeline infringes on her First Nation’s rights, and believes man camps pose a threat to Indigenous women. Her group blocked the road to the proposed man camp in anticipation of the pipeline’s approval.

“Yes, we’re here blockading, and TMX will never get built,” she said."

Chicago raises bridges to cut off access to wealthy areas due to civil unrest,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/bridges-raised-roads-closed-in-chicago-after-rioting-looting-breaks-out/ar-BB17MV6P,"© Scott Olson/Getty Images Police officers inspect a damaged Best Buy store after parts of the city had widespread looting and vandalism, on August 10, 2020 in Chicago, Illinois.

Bridges and roads were closed early Monday to prevent access to downtown Chicago after a night of unrest and looting in the city following an officer-involved shooting.

All bridges along the Chicago River were raised throughout The Loop, according to CBS Chicago.

Chicago's Officer of Emergency Management said on Twitter that streets are closed in the city's Magnificent Mile shopping district as well as Gold Coast and South Loop neighborhoods. The Illinois State Police also blocked some expressway ramps into downtown.

Meanwhile, the Chicago Transit Authority announced that train and bus services to the downtown area were suspended ""at the request of public safety officials.""

The measures came after mass looting took place in the downtown area, with reports of numerous businesses being ransacked and vehicles set on fire.

The Chicago Tribune reported that hundreds of people were seen going in and out of stores along the Magnificent Mile carrying shopping bags full of goods. People also ran out of a bank that had its windows smashed.

Early Monday morning, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department confirmed that officers had been involved in a shooting with civilians amid the unrest.

Spokesman Tom Ahern wrote on Twitter that said shots had been fired at police on Lake Street near Michigan Avenue, prompting officers to return fire.

No officers were injured in the shooting and it wasn't known if anyone was injured in the exchange, he said.

More than 100 arrests were made overnight, Chicago Police Supt. David Brown said during a news conference on Monday morning.

Hours before the unrest, people had faced off with police after officers shot and wounded a person Sunday in the city's Englewood neighborhood.

According to The Associated Press, a crowd had gathered on Sunday after someone reportedly told people that police had shot and injured a child, but the group eventually dispersed.

In a statement, Chicago police said they had responded to a call about a person with a gun at around 2.30 p.m. in the 5700 block of South Racine Avenue.

Officers saw a person matching the suspect's description and tried to confront him in a nearby alley. He fled from officers on foot and then produced a firearm and shot at officers, police said. Officers returned fire, striking the man and his firearm was recovered.

He was taken to the University of Chicago Hospital in an unknown condition, police said. No other details about him were immediately released.

Three officers involved in the incident were also transported to a hospital for observation. Police said the officers involved will be placed on routine administrative duties for 30 days as a use of force investigation is carried out by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability.

The Chicago Police Department has been contacted for additional comment.

Microplastic particles found in human organs by US scientists,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/microplastic-particles-discovered-in-human-organs,"Microplastic and nanoplastic particles are now discoverable in human organs thanks to a new technique.

Microplastics have polluted the entire planet, from Arctic snow and Alpine soils to the deepest oceans. People are also known to consume them via food and water, and to breathe them in, but the potential impact on human health is not yet known.

The researchers expect to find the particles in human organs and have identified chemical traces of plastic in tissue. But isolating and characterising such minuscule fragments is difficult, and contamination from plastics in the air is also a challenge.

To test their technique, they added particles to 47 samples of lung, liver, spleen and kidney tissue obtained from a tissue bank established to study neurodegenerative diseases. Their results showed that the microplastics could be detected in every sample.

The scientists, whose work is being presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society on Monday, said their technique would enable other researchers to determine contamination levels in human organs around the world.

“It would be naive to believe there is plastic everywhere but just not in us,” said Rolf Halden at Arizona State University. “We are now providing a research platform that will allow us and others to look for what is invisible – these particles too small for the naked eye to see. The risk [to health] really resides in the small particles.”

The analytical method developed allows the researchers to identify dozens of types of plastic, including the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in plastic drinks bottles and the polyethylene used in plastic bags.

They found bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical used to make plastics, in all 47 samples. The US Environmental Protection Agency is concerned about BPA because “it is a reproductive, developmental and systemic toxicant in animal studies”. The researchers examined lung, liver, spleen and kidney tissue as these organs are likely to be exposed to microplastics or collect them.

“We never want to be alarmist, but it is concerning that these non-biodegradable materials that are present everywhere [may] enter and accumulate in human tissues, and we don’t know the possible health effects,” said Varun Kelkar of Arizona State University, part of the research team.

“Once we get a better idea of what’s in the tissues, we can conduct epidemiological studies to assess human health outcomes,” he said. “That way, we can start to understand the potential health risks, if any.”

Charles Rolsky, another member of the team, said: “In a few short decades, we’ve gone from seeing plastic as a wonderful benefit to considering it a threat.”

Microplastics are those less than 5mm in diameter and nanoplastics have a diameter of less than 0.001mm. Both form largely from the abrasion of larger pieces of plastic dumped into the environment. Research in wildlife and laboratory animals has linked exposure to tiny plastics to infertility, inflammation and cancer.

The researchers are now testing tissues to find microplastics that accumulated during donors’ lifetimes. Donors to tissue banks often provide information on their lifestyles, diets and occupations, so this may help future work to determine the main ways in which people are exposed to microplastics.

The new methodology developed by the team to extract plastics from the tissues and analyse them will be shared online so other researchers can report their results in a standardised way. “This shared resource will help build a plastic exposure database so that we can compare exposures in organs and groups of people over time and geographic space,” said Halden.

Previous studies have shown people eat and breathe in at least 50,000 particles of microplastic a year and that microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with London, UK, having the highest level of four cities analysed last year. The particles can harbour toxic chemicals and harmful microbes and are known to harm some marine creatures.

Other work has shown different kinds of nanoparticles from air pollution are present in human hearts and brains, and have been linked to brain cancer.

• This article was updated on 17 August 2020, after more information was provided to the Guardian by the researchers, to reflect the fact that the plastic particles had been inserted into the samples of human tissue."
"""US Labor Market Is In Free-Fall"" - 10 Million Americans Have Filed For Unemployment In Past 2 Weeks",https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/shocking-9-million-americans-have-now-filed-unemployment-benefits-lockdowns-began,"After last week's unprecedented 3.3 million surge in initial jobless claims, this week's is even more unprecedented-er, adding a stunning 6.648 million (just 100k away from our estimate of 6.5million) for a two-week sum of 10 million new Americans claiming unemployment benefits...

Source: Bloomberg

As @GreekFire noted, ""We’ve lost 46 jobs for every confirmed case of COVID-19 in the US...""

The 6.648mm print is worse than the worst of 50 estimating analysts' expectations. Breaking down by state (which is one week lagged and so represents the prior week's 3.3mm print detail), California, Pennsylvania, and New York dominate...

Source: Bloomberg

And of course, last week's ""initial"" claims and this week's ""continuing"" claims...

Source: Bloomberg

This is simply stunning.

“The U.S. labor market is in free-fall,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “The prospect of more stringent lockdown measures and the fact that many states have not yet been able to process the full amount of jobless claim applications suggest the worst is still to come.”

And another important note is that weekly jobless claims data are based on ""hard facts"", UBS points out, unlike survey data

which is subject to quirks around:

a) some of the treatment of supply chains, which has flattered data, b) the fact that many respondents will not be replying to surveys during the virus disruption period, and c) survey data will give more accurate assessments during 'normal' times, perhaps not as much in unusual times.

Of course, the government is coming to the rescue. As a result of the freshly-passed 'relief' bill, self-employed and gig-workers who previously were unable to claim unemployment benefits are now eligible. In addition, the unemployed will get up to $600 per week for up to four months, which is equivalent to $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. By comparison, the government-mandated minimum wage is about $7.25 per hour and the average jobless benefits payment was roughly $385 per person per month at the start of this year.

“Why work when one is better off not working financially and health wise?” said a Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

With more than 80% of Americans under some form of lockdown, up from less than 50% a couple of weeks ago, this is far from over.

As RealInvestmentAdvice.com's Lance Roberts warns, the importance is that unemployment rates in the U.S. are about to spike to levels not seen since the “Great Depression.” Based on the number of claims being filed, we can estimate that unemployment will jump to 15-20% over the next quarter as economic growth slides 8%, or more. (I am probably overly optimistic.)

The erosion in employment will lead to a sharp deceleration in economic and consumer confidence, as was seen Tuesday in the release of the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index, which plunged from 132.6 to 120 in March.

This is a critical point. Consumer confidence is the primary factor of consumptive behaviors, which is why the Federal Reserve acted so quickly to inject liquidity into the financial markets. While the Fed’s actions may prop up financial markets in the short-term, it does little to affect the most significant factor weighing on consumers – their jobs.

The chart below is our “composite” confidence index, which combines several confidence surveys into one measure. Notice that during each of the previous two bear market cycles, confidence dropped by an average of 58 points.

With consumer confidence just starting its reversion from high levels, it suggests that as job losses rise, confidence will slide further, putting further pressure on asset prices. Another way to analyze confidence data is to look at the composite consumer expectations index minus the current situation index in the reports.

Similarly, given we have only started the reversion process, bear markets end when deviations reverse. The differential between expectations and the current situation, as you can see below, is worse than the last cycle, and only slightly higher than before the “dot.com” crash.

If you are betting on a fast economic recovery, I wouldn’t.

There is a fairly predictable cycle, starting with CEO’s moving to protect profitability, which gets worked through until exhaustion is reached.

As unemployment rises, we are going to begin to see the faults in the previous employment numbers that I have repeatedly warned about over the last 18-months. To wit:

“There is little argument the streak of employment growth is quite phenomenal and comes amid hopes the economy is beginning to shift into high gear. But while most economists focus at employment data from one month to the next for clues as to the strength of the economy, it is the ‘trend’ of the data, which is far more important to understand.”

That “trend” of employment data has been turning negative since President Trump was elected, which warned the economy was actually substantially weaker than headlines suggested. More than once, we warned that an “unexpected exogenous event” would exposure the soft-underbelly of the economy.

The virus was just such an event.

While many economists and media personalities are expecting a “V”-shaped recovery as soon as the virus passes, the employment data suggests an entirely different outcome.

The chart below shows the peak annual rate of change for employment prior to the onset of a recession. The current cycle peaked at 2.2% in 2015, and has been on a steady decline ever since. At 1.3%, which predated the virus, it was the lowest level ever preceding a recessionary event. All that was needed was an “event” to start the dominoes falling. When we see the first round of unemployment data, we are likely to test the lows seen during the financial crisis confirming a recession has started.

No Recession In 2020?

It is worth noting that NO mainstream economists, or mainstream media, were predicting a recession in 2020. However, as we noted in 2019, the inversion of the “yield curve,” predicted exactly that outcome.

“To CNBC’s point, based on this lagging, and currently unrevised, economic data, there is ‘NO recession in sight,’ so you should be long equities, right? Which indicator should you follow? The yield curve is an easy answer. While everybody is ‘freaking out’ over the ‘inversion,’it is when the yield-curve ‘un-inverts’ that is the most important. The chart below shows that when the Fed is aggressively cutting rates, the yield curve un-inverts as the short-end of the curve falls faster than the long-end. (This is because money is leaving ‘risk’ to seek the absolute ‘safety’ of money markets, i.e. ‘market crash.’)”

I have dated a few of the key points of the “inversion of the curve.” As of today, the yield-curve is now fully un-inverted, denoting a recession has started.

While recent employment reports were slightly above expectations, the annual rate of growth has been slowing. The 3-month average of the seasonally-adjusted employment report, also confirms that employment was already in a precarious position and too weak to absorb a significant shock. (The 3-month average smooths out some of the volatility.)

What we will see in the next several employment reports are vastly negative numbers as the economy unwinds.

Lastly, while the BLS continually adjusts and fiddles with the data to mathematically adjust for seasonal variations, the purpose of the entire process is to smooth volatile monthly data into a more normalized trend. The problem, of course, with manipulating data through mathematical adjustments, revisions, and tweaks, is the risk of contamination of bias.

We previously proposed a much simpler method to use for smoothing volatile monthly data using a 12-month moving average of the raw data as shown below.

Notice that near peaks of employment cycles the BLS employment data deviates from the 12-month average, or rather “overstates” the reality. However, as we will now see to be the case, the BLS data will rapidly reconnect with 12-month average as reality emerges.

Sometimes, “simpler” gives us a better understanding of the data.

Importantly, there is one aspect to all the charts above which remains constant. No matter how you choose to look at the data, peaks in employment growth occur prior to economic contractions, rather than an acceleration of growth.

“Okay Boomer”

Just as “baby boomers” were finally getting back to the position of being able to retire following the 2008 crash, the “bear market” has once again put those dreams on hold. Of course, there were already more individuals over the age of 55, as a percentage of that age group, in the workforce than at anytime in the last 50-years. However, we are likely going to see a very sharp drop in those numbers as “forced retirement” will surge.

The group that will to be hit the hardest are those between 25-54 years of age. With more than 15-million restaurant workers being terminated, along with retail, clerical, leisure, and hospitality workers, the damage to this demographic will be the heaviest.

There is a decent correlation between surges in the unemployment rate and the decline in the labor-force participation rate of the 25-54 age group. Given the expectation of a 15%, or greater, unemployment rate, the damage to this particular age group is going to be significant.

Unfortunately, the prime working-age group of labor force participants had only just returned to pre-2008 levels, and the same levels seen previously in 1988. Unfortunately, it may be another decade before we see those employment levels again.

Why This Matters

The employment impact is going to felt for far longer, and will be far deeper, than the majority of the mainstream media and economists expect. This is because they are still viewing this as a “singular” problem of a transitory virus.

It isn’t.

The virus was simply the catalyst which started the unwind of a decade-long period of debt accumulation and speculative excesses. Businesses, both small and large, will now go through a period of “culling the herd,” to lower operating costs and maintain profitability.

There are many businesses that will close, and never reopen. Most others will cut employment down to the bone and will be very slow to rehire as the economy begins to recover. Most importantly, wage growth was already on the decline, and will be cut deeply in the months to come.

Lower wage growth, unemployment, and a collapse in consumer confidence is going to increase the depth and duration of the recession over the months to come. The contraction in consumption will further reduce revenues and earnings for businesses which will require a deeper revaluation of asset prices.

I just want to leave you with a statement I made previously:

“Every financial crisis, market upheaval, major correction, recession, etc. all came from one thing – an exogenous event that was not forecast or expected. This is why bear markets are always vicious, brutal, devastating, and fast. It is the exogenous event, usually credit-related, which sucks the liquidity out of the market, causing prices to plunge. As prices fall, investors begin to panic-sell driving prices lower which forces more selling in the market until, ultimately, sellers are exhausted. It is the same every time.”

Over the last several years, investors have insisted the markets were NOT in a bubble. We reminded them that everyone thought the same in 1999 and 2007.

Throughout history, financial bubbles have only been recognized in hindsight when their existence becomes “apparently obvious” to everyone. Of course, by that point is was far too late to be of any use to investors and the subsequent destruction of invested capital.

It turned out, “this time indeed was not different.” Only the catalyst, magnitude, and duration was.

Pay attention to employment and wages. The data suggests the current “bear market” cycle has only just begun.

Finally, as Southbay Research warns, by the time this mess settles, at least 20M American workers will have been furloughed. The math is relentless.

Self-isolation is crushing the Leisure & Hospitality sector (17M workers). Most of them are set to be out of work. Indeed, confirming the sector's pain, SouthBay's review of local job postings found a massive collapse: Leisure & Hospitality postings fell 80% compared to the same period last year. That figure will only worsen as more States and cities impose a lock down.

And that's just one sector. Every sector is taking a hit, some more than others, but the average drop in labor demand is >50% (as reflected in job postings).

Things will get a bit uglier before they level off.

But Goldman has something positive to look for - even as this all begins to worsen dramatically - during the recovery from the last recession, GDP stabilized when initial claims first started to come down and continuing claims hit their peak. GDP started growing again when initial claims had fallen 1/3 of the way back to the pre-crisis level and continuing claims were falling quickly, as shown in Exhibit 2.

In the months ahead, we think that a levelling off of continuing claims will be a good signal that GDP has stabilized. Continuing claims will also likely be the clearer indicator that GDP has started growing again. Initial claims might normalize somewhat gradually as second-round effects of the virus shock generate ongoing layoffs. Continuing claims will better pick up an increase in hiring, which should accelerate more quickly than in a typical recession as some economic activities shut down by virus fears rebound more immediately (though this depends on the unemployment insurance benefits available at that point and on whether the economy recovers via slow adaptation or a more abrupt medical breakthrough)."
"So many people are filing for unemployment, it's crashing government websites",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-unemployment-claims-crash-websites/,"As the coronavirus pandemic shuts down business across the county, a surge in newly laid off workers is crashing states' unemployment websites.

In Ohio, more than 48,000 people applied for jobless benefits during the first two days of this week — 26 times the amount from the week before.

In neighboring Pennsylvania, about 70,000 people sought unemployment aid in a single day — six times the total for the entire previous week.

In Kentucky, the state's unemployment assistance site and phone lines went down amid a fourfold surge in applications.

Oregon's unemployment website went down on Monday, just as the state's governor was announcing a closure of bars and restaurants.

New York State on Tuesday received 21,000 calls from people asking about unemployment benefits — a tenfold increase from the week before. Website visits tripled, periodically crashing the system.

Genna Guglietta said she spent two days trying to apply for unemployment benefits in New York. ""The first night I couldn't even get past logging in,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch.

Guglietta waits tables at a restaurant in Hudson, New York, and lost her job when the restaurant closed its doors to comply with a statewide ban on eat-in dining. Her boyfriend, a sous chef at the same restaurant, was laid off, too.

On Tuesday, she was finally able to file for benefits, giving her ""a bit of relief"" but adding fresh worries. ""I have no idea how much I'll be receiving,"" Guglietta said.

In a typical month, the $1,825 she spends on rent, utilities and car payments takes up about half her paycheck. Her landlord has discounted her rent for the time being, she said, but she's waiting to see if she can cover her bills.

The full scale of layoffs from coronavirus is not yet known. Some 4 million hospitality workers could lose their jobs this summer, according to an estimate from the outplacement firm Challenger Gray and Christmas. The Economic Policy Institute estimates 3 million laid-off workers by this summer. The Travel Industry Association estimates 4.6 million workers in that field alone will lose their jobs this year.

The number of workers filing for unemployment could exceed the 660,000 a week reached during the Great Recession and even the 695,000 hit during the recession of 1982, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a global accounting consultancy.

""Given the three shocks—supply, demand, and financial—that are cascading in the real economy as we speak, we are likely to exceed the all-time high sometime in next two months,"" Brusuelas said.

The federal government is scheduled to release unemployment claims data on Thursday, but that number is likely to be incomplete. Because unemployment insurance is handled by states, which set their own procedures, it can take anywhere from two to four weeks for that information to be reported and collected into federal data.

""There's not one uniform rule that frames how somebody applies, and how long it takes to get them a check. It's all done 50 different ways,"" Brusuelas said. ""This is going to be a rolling exercise in estimating the damage to the labor market due to the crisis.""

According to a Marist poll conducted late last week, nearly 1 in 5 workers reported that someone in their household has lost their job or had their hours cut.

Already, some states are raising concerns about having enough money stockpiled since the last recession to tide over laid-off workers until the crisis ends. Some fear the demand for help could outpace the states' ability to pay claims, the Associated Press reports.

""Our unemployment insurance fund is getting hit pretty hard right now,"" Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo told the AP. In that state, coronavirus-related jobless claims went from zero to nearly 18,000 in a single week.

Raimondo, a Democrat, told the AP the state already needed to start replenishing its fund and is appealing for help from the federal government, which she said needed to ""step up.""

Minnesota, meanwhile, is preparing for the largest unemployment payout in the state's history, Twin City Business Journal reported.

""We have had these unemployment crises in the past, and the government has learned to respond to them effectively. But this is not just an unemployment crisis, it's a social crisis,"" said Michael Merrill, a labor historian at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations in New Jersey.

Merrill is one of many calling for the government to go beyond sending Americans checks: He's asking for a large-scale mobilization of laid-off workers — akin to that during the Great Depression. He pointed to reports that the Trump administration was planning for the pandemic to last as long as 18 months.

""A $2,000 check isn't going to do it. It's a help, but it's a very short-term plan,"" he said. ""It isn't just an economic panic. It's a war that requires total mobilization.""

U.S debt outlook is downgraded to negative,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/31/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.amp.html,"U.S. Debt Outlook is Downgraded This briefing is no longer being updated. Follow the latest developments here.

Fitch Ratings downgrades its outlook on U.S. debt. The national debt topped $22 trillion in March. Cratering tax revenues and surging expenditures have driven record levels of red ink for the federal government in recent months. Credit... Gabby Jones for The New York Times The credit rating firm Fitch left the United States’ AAA rating untouched, but downgraded its outlook on what is effectively the national credit score, suggesting the country’s status as one of the world’s most trustworthy borrowers could be put at risk by the enormous deficits the federal government is running to combat the fallout from the pandemic. “The outlook has been revised to negative to reflect the ongoing deterioration in the U.S. public finances and the absence of a credible fiscal consolidation plan,” Fitch analysts wrote on Friday in a report announcing the decision. Cratering tax revenues and surging expenditures have driven record levels of red ink for the federal government in recent months. The United States’ budget deficit hit a record $864 billion in June as the government continued pumping money into the economy to support workers and businesses slammed by the pandemic. Some analysts expect monthly deficits to soon top $1 trillion. Ballooning deficits have led to an explosion of new borrowing. Fitch noted that the Treasury Department borrowed just under $3 trillion dollars from the end of February to the end of June. Much of the supply of new government bonds was, essentially, purchased by the Federal Reserve, which has bought $2.6 trillion in financial assets since the middle of March, Fitch noted. The presence of the Federal Reserve, which can essentially create whatever money it wants and use it to buy assets, such as U.S. government debt, has depressed yields on government bonds even as debts and deficits rise sharply. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 0.53 percent, one of the lowest levels in recorded history, suggesting there is virtually no concern among investors about the country’s ability to service its growing debts. —

Kodak’s chief executive was given stock options. Then the share price spiked 1,000 percent. The current Kodak chief executive, Jim Continenza, left, in 2014 with Antonio Perez, the former chief. Credit... Richard Drew/Associated Press Earlier this week, The Times reported on the well-timed stock bets that have generated big profits for senior executives and board members at companies developing vaccines and treatments. Jesse Drucker and Ellen Gabler have the latest example: At the beginning of this week, the Eastman Kodak Company handed Jim Continenza, its chief executive, 1.75 million stock options. It was the type of compensation decision that generally wouldn’t attract much notice, except for one thing: The day after the stock options were granted, the White House announced that the company would receive a $765 million federal loan to produce ingredients to make pharmaceuticals in the United States. The news of the deal caused Kodak’s shares to soar more than 1,000 percent. Within 48 hours of the options grants, their value had ballooned, at least on paper, to about $50 million. A Kodak spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of the stock-options grants and emphasized that the value of the options could change before Mr. Continenza uses them to buy Kodak shares. Starting in May, Kodak began talks with the Trump administration about manufacturing the ingredients for pharmaceuticals, Mr. Continenza said in a television interview this week. The deal was announced on Tuesday. President Trump said the federal loan from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation would help reduce the United States’ reliance on other countries, in particular China and India, for the vast majority of ingredients used to make generic drugs. Mr. Trump called the Kodak deal “a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States.”

United will add international flights despite travel restrictions limiting U.S. visitors. Many people are still flying for essential business, to visit friends and family or to return home. Some of the shorter international flights United is adding will serve limited demand for leisure travel. Credit... Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel, via Associated Press United Airlines plans to add more than 25 international routes to its September schedule, a sign of limited optimism in a battered industry at a time when coronavirus cases continue to rise across the country. Many of the new routes include destinations in Europe and Asia, where governments restrict or limit American visitors. United said it would adjust its schedule as necessary to deal with travel and quarantine restrictions. “We continue to be realistic in our approach to building back our international and domestic schedules by closely monitoring customer demand and flying where people want to go,” Patrick Quayle, United’s vice president of international network and alliances, said in a statement. Many people are still flying for essential business, to visit friends and family or to return home. Some of the shorter international flights United is adding will serve limited demand for leisure travel. The airline said it would launch a new route connecting Chicago and Tel Aviv if it could obtain government approval. The airline will also resume service between some of its American hubs and Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Munich, Sydney, Costa Rica, St. Thomas, Ecuador and several destinations in Mexico. United also plans to continue to fly to New Delhi and Mumbai and between Chicago and Hong Kong, pending government approval. Overall, the airline plans to operate about 37 percent of the flights it flew last September, a relative increase from August. The Transportation Security Administration has only screened about 26 percent as many people at its checkpoint in recent days as it did on the same days a year ago. The news comes a day after United dealt what appeared to be a fatal blow to ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operates under the United Express brand. United has a 49.9 percent stake in ExpressJet. In a note to staff on Thursday, ExpressJet’s chief executive, Subodh Karnik, said that the two airlines would work together to wind down ExpressJet’s operations after United decided to make another regional carrier, CommutAir, the sole operator of United Express flights aboard the small Embraer ERJ145 jet. —

Europe’s contraction is its worst on record.

From April to June, economic activity fell 12.1 percent from the previous quarter among the countries that use the euro currency. It was sharpest contraction since 1995, when the data was first collected, according to Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency. Compared to the same period a year ago, the decline was sharper: Economic activity shrank 15 percent from the 2nd quarter of 2019. The collapse marks the severe economic disruption caused by the pandemic. Governments ordered lockdowns that silenced many cities, and residents were told to stay home to prevent the virus’s spread. On Thursday, the United States announced its economy contracted 9.5 percent in the 2nd quarter compared to the previous three-month period. But there are signs the worst may have passed since then, and that a tentative recovery is gaining some traction as European governments unleashed enormous stimulus spending. The lengthy lockdowns have helped curb a widespread resurgence of the pandemic in most countries. The data was especially grim for nations on Europe’s southern rim, which were among the worst affected by the virus and which faced longer quarantine periods than northern European countries. In Spain, which has had one of Europe’s highest death tolls, the economy shrank by a staggering 18.5 percent from the previous quarter. France, the eurozone’s second-largest economy, shrank by 13.8 percent; and Italy, the third-largest economy in the zone, contracted by 12.4 percent. France is officially in recession, with three straight quarters of contraction. On Thursday, the authorities reported that the German economy, Europe’s largest, shrank by 10.1 percent from the previous quarter. European Union leaders last week agreed to a landmark stimulus of 750 billion euros, or about $884 billion, to rescue their economies and to anchor a mild turnaround that had started to take hold after lockdowns began to be lifted. But risks abound as surges in new cases are reported, increasing the possibility of more quarantines. “The hard part of this recovery is set to start about now,” Bert Colijn, senior economist for the eurozone at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. —

Economic snapshots: France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A mild rebound in consumer spending and business activity after quarantines were lifted has helped France avoid a far sharper economic decline. Credit... Kamil Zihnioglu/Associated Press European countries have, for the most part, contained the spread of coronavirus. But the outbreak, which was early and widespread, has left a deep scar on the region’s economy:a 12 percent contraction in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter. Different government interventions and infection rates means the impact has been uneven. Here are snapshots from the region’s largest economies in the three months that ended in June. France Though France’s 13.8 percent decline is stark, a mild rebound in consumer spending and business activity after quarantines were lifted has helped the country avoid a far sharper decline. In fact, the nation’s central bank recently revised its economic forecasts, expecting slightly less damage in the next few years. The government’s largess has been key: It spent over 100 billion euros ($118 billion) to pay businesses not to lay off workers; it delayed deadlines for business taxes and loan payments; and it deployed over 300 billion euros in state-guaranteed loans to struggling companies. Germany The 10.1 percent drop in Germany’s G.D.P., the largest since the country began keeping quarterly records, might already be painting a darker picture of the economy than is warranted. Separate data released Thursday showed the labor market stabilized in July and surveys of business activity indicate a quick rebound. But the continuation of this recovery is at risk. Germany was in a better position than other European Union countries because the government was effective in containing the spread of the coronavirus. However, there is now an increase in new infections as Germans return from holidays abroad, stoking fear of a second wave. Italy The devastating economic impact of Italy’s outbreak and lockdown, the first in Europe, was a 12.4 percent drop in G.D.P. While the central bank estimates that two government relief packages mitigated the contraction, a slow return in tourism, consumer spending, and business investment is dragging the recovery down. “At least for Italy, the possibility of a V-shaped recovery is not what we have in front of us,” Bank of Italy’s governor, Daniele Franco, said. One slice of the economy is experiencing a stronger rebound: industrial production. During the first phase of the lockdown, which ended in early May, half of the Italian companies that were forced to shut managed to reopen, the central bank said. Spain Spain’s recession is the deepest of all the European countries that have reported second-quarter G.D.P. so far. The economy contracted 18.5 percent compared to the first three months of the year, and the outlook for the rest of the year is grim. Spain officially ended its Covid-19 state of emergency on June 21, but it has since been struggling with an increase in the number of new cases and over 300 local outbreaks, particularly severe in the northeast. Tourism is a substantial component of the Spanish economy but hopes of a tourism-led economic recovery this summer have been undermined by quarantine restrictions placed on the nation and its islands by Britain and other countries. — Liz Alderman, Jack Ewing, Emma Bubola, Raphael Minder and

Exxon reports a record loss and Chevron writes off Venezuela investments. Exxon’s oil production was down 3 percent and natural gas output was down 12 percent from a year ago, a reflection of the crippling of global demand for energy. Credit... Loren Elliott/Reuters Exxon Mobil announced a record-breaking quarterly loss of $1.1 billion, blaming the coronavirus pandemic for lowering oil and gas prices and sales volumes. The results from the largest American oil producer were further evidence of the deepest downturn for the industry in the modern era. Oil prices have recovered in recent weeks to around $40 a barrel, but that is still roughly a third below the oil price of the beginning of the year. Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, also posted disappointing results for the quarter on Friday and said it was writing off its $2.6 billion investment in Venezuela because of the country’s political instability and American sanctions against its government. Exxon’s oil production was down 3 percent and natural gas output was down 12 percent, compared to the quarter a year ago, a reflection of the crippling of global demand for energy due to a worldwide recession. Darren W. Woods, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, attempted to put the best face on the results. “The global pandemic and oversupply conditions significantly impacted our second quarter financial results,” he said. “We responded decisively by reducing near-term spending and continuing work to improve efficiency. The progress we’ve made to date gives us confidence that we will meet or exceed our cost-reduction targets.” The $1.1 billion loss compares to a profit of $3.1 billion a year ago. At the same time the company’s capital and exploration expenditures were down to $5.3 billion from $8.1 billion in the quarter last year. Chevron said it lost $8.3 billion in the quarter; a year earlier it reported a $4.3 billion profit. The company reported an adjusted quarterly loss of $3 billion, excluding one-time items, compared to adjusted earnings of $3.4 billion in the same quarter of 2019. In addition to the $2.6 billion Venezuelan write down, Chevron also took a $1.8 billion write down based on the company’s oil and gas price outlook. Chevron reported sales and other revenue of $16 billion, compared to $36 billion in the same period a year earlier. “We’re focused on what we can control,” Michael K. Wirth, Chevron’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “We’re transforming our company to be more efficient, agile and innovative.” Exxon and Chevron said they would maintain their dividends. —

Fiat Chrysler lost $1.2 billion in the second quarter A Fiat Chrysler Automobiles assembly plant in Brazil, in May. Credit... Washington Alves/Reuters Fiat Chrysler reported a net loss of 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in the second quarter, but said it expects improving economic conditions to lift its fortunes in the second half of the year. Forced to shut down operations in Europe and North American for much of the quarter because of the pandemic, Fiat Chrysler said revenue dropped 56 percent, to 11.7 billion euros. It also used some 5 billion euros in cash. In a conference call, the automaker’s chief executive, Mike Manley, said auto sales are recovering faster than had been expected, and the company has been able to ramp production back to normal levels in North America. Its European plants should return to typical production levels in the third quarter, the company said. “We expect significant improvement in profitability and cash flows,” he said. “We expect a much, much better second half.” The automaker also plans to introduce five new electric vehicles in the coming months, including plug-in hybrid versions of three different Jeep models. Fiat Chrysler is in the process of merging with French automaker PSA Group, maker of the Peugeot and Citroën brands. The combined company will be called Stellantis. —

Government payments helped lift income and spending, but that could soon end. Outside New York Stock Exchange and Wall Street. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Government payments played a critical role in propping up the American economy, data released Friday shows. Consumer spending rose 5.6 percent in June, the Commerce Department said, the second straight monthly increase after a record-setting plunge in April. But the end of some benefits, namely the $1,200 payment made to many individuals, also meant that personal income fell 1.1 percent last month. Incomes could fall further now that the federal government’s additional unemployment benefits have ended, at least temporarily. To understand what’s happening, it helps to go back to the beginning of the pandemic. When businesses began shutting their doors and furloughing workers in March, both incomes and spending fell. Congress then stepped in with a multi-trillion-dollar rescue package, which included sending $1,200 checks to most American families and expanding the unemployment insurance system. As a result, personal incomes rose a record 12.1 percent in April, despite a big drop in wage and salary earnings. But spending still fell, at least in part because people had fewer opportunities to go shopping and dine out. (Other data suggests spending fell sharply among the wealthy, while rebounding more quickly for other income groups once government checks began arriving.) In May and June, those patterns began to reverse. Spending picked back up as the economy reopened. Wage and salary incomes rose too, as companies began rehiring furloughed workers. Government payments fell with the end of the $1,200 checks, but remained high. The net result: Overall personal income was higher in June than in February. But without government intervention — especially the expanded unemployment benefits, which are injecting money into the economy at a rate of $1.4 trillion a year — incomes would be lower now than when the crisis began. Spending has rebounded but remains almost 7 percent below its precrisis level, even with the government help. And now, that help is in danger of running out: The $600 a week in extra unemployment benefits expires today, and senators have left for the weekend. —

U.S. sanctions more Chinese officials over human rights violations as tensions flare The Trump administration announced new sanctions Friday on two Chinese officials and one government entity, citing human rights abuses against predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region in China’s far west. The sanctions, administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, effectively cut the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and two of its former officials, Sun Jinlong and Peng Jiarui, off from American property and the financial system. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is an economic and paramilitary organization in charge of economic development in the region. “The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its financial powers to hold human rights abusers accountable in Xinjiang and across the world,” Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said in a statement. Ties between the United States and China have been fraying as the Trump administration takes an increasingly critical posture on China’s handling of coronavirus, its growing influence over Hong Kong, its territorial disputes in the South China Sea and its treatment of a largely Muslim minority in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has carried out a campaign of mass detentions in Xinjiang, placing one million or more members of Muslim and other minority groups into large internment camps intended to increase their loyalty to the Communist Party. On July 20, the Trump administration added 11 new Chinese entities, including firms supplying major American brands like Apple, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, to a list that cuts them off from purchasing American products without a special license, saying the firms were complicit in human rights violations in Xinjiang. On July 1, the administration issued a warning to businesses with supply chains that run through Xinjiang to consider the reputational, economic and legal risks of doing so. —

"It's time we started calling it ""climate apocalypse"" instead of ""climate change"" and ""annihilation"" instead of ""extinction""",https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/you/if-we-want-to-stop-the-climate-breakdown-we-need-new-words-to-communicate-it-19794,"These questions (and a dozen more) set us on the path to become the world first organisation trying to make sense of the charitable space and all the organisations in it. The vetting framework we started to build should allow us to benchmark charitable organisations focussing on a certain problem in a certain region and simply allowing the funders to pick the best performers. Everybody wins. The funders, the organisations, the beneficiairies, the planet.

So fast forward to 2020.

The pandemic is making it very tough for organisations to connect to funders in the conventional ways. All sports events (often used for fundraisers) are paused. All fundraising events they normally organise are cancelled. Even door collections or street raising has come to a halt. So there is some real urgency in providing new and improved ways to raise funds.

Right now we are at the stage that we have a great university backed framework. We've vetted over 2500 organisations and tweaked the algorithm. And we've created some great products and services to raise funds. Right now it is time to connect the data to the funders and start raising for the top 10%.

Call for brands

And for this we need to involve brands.

Bold brands that really want to do good, better. Brands that want to tackle important problems in the world.

Brands that will embrace an appeal to fix that problem.

Because together we have the power to effect change and to inspire and motivate people.



We want to enable this strength to make a difference, creating a community of concerned citizens and organisations that are creating lasting impact.



I’ve seen the effects of a silo mentality in the charitable landscape.



This call is for Brands that dare to stand up and tear down these silos. Because only together we can make a change.

"Polls warning of civil war, violence shows deep partisan chasm over election",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/07/both-sides-worry-doubts-election-integrity-could-spark-violence/5880965002/,"'The country’s lost its mind': Polls warning of civil war, violence shows deep partisan chasm over election

Ledyard King | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption Voter registration day: Here's why your vote matters more than ever Thinking of sitting out the election? Here's why your vote counts. Register, verify your status or request an absentee ballot at vote.usatoday.com.

WASHINGTON – Bill Fry, 61, is a supporter of President Donald Trump in rural Ohio who doesn't share much in common politically with Matt Edelman, 29, a Joe Biden backer in Brooklyn, New York.

Except this: They both worry about the legitimacy of the upcoming presidential election and fear an outcome that appears tainted could heighten the nation's already frayed psyche and exacerbate violence in the streets.

They're not alone. A new poll shows a large swath of Americans harbor deep reservations about the election results weeks before Election Day and are concerned about what actions people might resort to as a consequence.

The YouGov poll of 1,999 registered voters found that nearly half – 47% – disagree with the idea that the election ""is likely to be fair and honest."" And that slightly more than half – 51% – won't ""generally agree on who is the legitimately elected president of the United States."" The online poll was conducted Oct.1-2 and has a margin of error of +/- 2.56 percentage points.

How a contentious election affects a peaceful transition of power What history has shown us about contested elections and peaceful transitions of power.

ELECTION: 'Security of your vote has never been higher,' feds say

In addition, a YouGov poll of 1,505 voters found that 56% said they expect to see ""an increase in violence as a result of the election."" That question had a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points.

For Fry and many other Trump supporters, the concern over the election's legitimacy is tied to the largely unproven claims Trump has raised about potential fraud involving millions of mail-in ballots that already have begun to pour in to election office across the nation.

""We would be foolish to not at least accept that it’s a real thing that happens sometimes, and I just worry that it’s going to happen in a greater numbers this year,"" said Fry, a Marine veteran who owns a dental management company in Blanchester, Ohio. ""And a lot of my friends think the same things.”

For Edelman and other Biden supporters, the worry is that Trump's unrelenting criticism of the mail-in ballots and his refusal to agree to a peaceful transition of power if he loses is proof that he'll stop at little to reverse what Edelman believes will be an electoral defeat given polls showing Biden with a significant lead nationally.

“Trump is already casting doubt on the legitimacy of vote by mail which tells me that he may try to dispute the result legally or by decree or who knows by what means,"" said Edelman, an assistant to the learning specialist at a local school who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary. ""He’s a liar. He will promote baseless conspiracy theories if he feel it will benefit him politically.""

More: Trump declines to commit to peaceful transfer of power, McConnell promises 'orderly transition'

Both Fry and Edelman are members of Braver Angels, an organization that promotes civility and healing between ""reds and blues"" and regularly holds workshops where participants can air opposing views. The group, formerly known as Better Angels, began in 2017 when half the country was having trouble getting over Trump's victory and the other half resented them for not being able to accept it gracefully.

Braver Angels, which commissioned the YouGov poll, has issued a ""Letter from America,"" a national campaign asking citizens, civic groups and religious organizations to pledge that they will disavow violence from either side and respect those who voted differently.

""If in the near future we face a constitutional crisis in which our institutions cannot produce consensus on who is the legitimately elected president, we resolve to work together across this chasm for solutions grounded in the Constitution and guided by our democratic and non-violent traditions and our sense of shared destiny,"" the letter says.

The election is less than a month away, and the country has been roiled for months over a series of crises exposing deep partisan rifts: a pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans; an economy that has lost millions of jobs as a result; street protests over police brutality that have included instances of rioting; a contentious fight over a Supreme Court seat that could be asked to decide the election; and the COVID-19 diagnosis of the president, his top aides and some senators.

'Dehumanizing' the other side

Alex Theodoridis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, has studied the country's growing partisan divide. The reasonable chance that the election comes down to a few states and that legal challenges could mean a protracted court battle would give voters on both sides more ammunition to doubt the integrity of the election and act out, he said.

""A close, contested election in our hyper-polarized political climate could very well produce isolated incidents of partisan violence,"" he said. ""My research, and work by others, shows that most partisans are willing to metaphorically dehumanize those from the other party and that this dehumanization predicts greater tolerance for partisan violence.""

And each side is apt to blame the other for inciting disorder.

""If Trump wins, I fear chaotic, destructive hate will continue,"" said Chrissy Koach, 49, a Braver Angels member and Trump supporter from Arlington, Virginia, who works part time for a international development and relief nonprofit organization.

""Trump Derangement Syndrome really exists and some people will not stop,"" she wrote in an email to USA TODAY. ""But that shouldn’t frighten me into voting as they want me to vote. Even if President Trump wins by a landslide/legitimately, I believe irrational people will persist and continue to sow hate, fear, etc.""

Noor Ain, 23, an architecture student who emigrated from Pakistan as a child, is worried about what will happen in the aftermath of the election. A Biden supporter who initially backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic presidential primary, Ain said Trump's victory in 2016 ""validated"" hate in the U.S. and that his followers could act up even if he wins reelection.

“The country’s already pretty divided, and it’s only become more and more divided in the past four years,"" she said. ""Considering the state of things this year, there's a lot of different emotions and there are a lot of people who feel very strongly about different sides. Whatever the outcome is, I feel like there will be a rise in violence.""

'On the verge' of civil war

Those sentiments might help explain the conclusion of a new survey that finds a majority of U.S. adults believe the country is ""on the verge"" of a second civil war. Of those, four of 10 said they ""strongly agree"" with that sentiment expressed most sharply by those identifying themselves as very conservative or very liberal.

The online poll Sept. 23 has a margin of error of 4.42 percentage points in either direction.

“This is the single most frightening poll result I’ve ever been associated with,” said Rich Thau, president of Engagious, one of the three firms, along with the Sports and Leisure Research Group and ROKK Solutions, that sponsored the survey.

Thau said that the partisan tensions have been ""bubbling below the surface or just above"" for some time and that the divisions are being ruptured further by a pandemic over which both sides disagree on the severity and response and an election in which both sides view each other as hardened combatants.

""So, what’s the consequence of that? How bad does this get?"" said Thau, who has been holding focus groups with battleground state voters as part of the Swing Voter Project. ""You’ve got people on the far left with guns, people on the far right with guns. And an unwillingness of political elites to condemn this. ... People are girding themselves for something awful to happen.”

The poll doesn't define what a civil war would look like. Would it be armed confrontation in some areas or just widespread protests? Would it involve economic boycotts or simply family members and friends who no longer speak to one another?

'Our country is in a dangerous place'

On Tuesday, Biden was in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the site of the defining Civil War battle in 1863 that ended up saving the Union, to make a point about the need to heal the country's political chasms.

""Today again, we are a house divided,"" he said.

""As I look across America today, I'm concerned the country is in a dangerous place,"" the former vice president said. ""Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many American see our public life not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting partisan warfare. Instead of treating each other's party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end.""

Like many Americans, Carlos Hernandez, 63, of San Francisco has already seen friendships disappear over his support for Trump.

“I have lost individuals who I thought were friends in the aftermath (of the 2016 election). And that’s been sad for me,"" said the social business strategist and former Barack Obama supporter who lives in one of the America's bluest pockets. “Can I rule out fellow citizens from acting out? I’d be foolish to say I can't. It would be sad for us if that were to happen.”

Braver Angels and other groups appealing for calm and civility hope their efforts can act as a tourniquet on the country's political wounds. Both Fry, the Republican, and Edelman, the Democrat, lament how bad it has gotten.

For some, the worst division they've ever seen

“I think our democracy has certainly never been weaker in my lifetime,"" Edelman said.

But neither say the country is irretrievably on course for armed conflict.

“It’s scary, but I don’t think we’re ready to have a civil war like the last civil war,"" said Fry, who blames the media for treating Trump unfairly and for fanning the flames of partisan discord.

Thau said he has never seen anything like it.

“I was a history major in college and I try to imagine how someone will explain this to other people 50 years from now,"" he said. ""It just seems like the country’s lost its mind."""
Climate not considered a top 10 risk by CEOs - survey,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/climate-considered-top-10-risk-ceos-survey-68406767,"Climate not considered a top 10 risk by CEOs - survey A survey of CEOs shows that they do not put climate issues among the top ten threats to business growth

DAVOS, Switzerland -- Climate issues are set to be one of the main talking points at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week, but a survey of CEOs released Monday shows that they are not even ranked among the top ten threats to business growth.

In its annual report ahead of the gathering in Davos, financial services group PwC said climate change and environmental issues are ranked as the 11th biggest threat to their companies' growth prospects. Though up one spot from the same survey a year ago, climate-related issues lag way behind other concerns such as over-regulation, which ranks as the number 1 worry. Other concerns in the top 10 include trade conflicts, lack of skills among workers and populism in politics.

According to the survey, 24% of CEOs are “extremely concerned” about climate-related issues, compared to 38% for over-regulation.

As they gather for the World Economic Forum, CEOs and politicians like U.S. President Donald Trump are set to face mounting pressure from environmental groups and activists like Swedish teen Greta Thunberg to respond to the climate emergency. The meeting follows last week's revelation that the last decade was the hottest ever recorded on Earth.

The survey also found that the number of CEOs who are pessimistic about the economic outlook has almost doubled over the past year, with 53% predicting a decline in the rate of growth this year, up from 29% in 2019. This is the highest level of pessimism recorded by PwC since it started surveying the issue in 2012 and illustrates how the trade conflict between the U.S. and China has weighed on the global economy.

PwC said pessimism was widespread but particularly so in North America, Western Europe and the Middle East.

“Given the lingering uncertainty over trade tensions, geopolitical issues and the lack of agreement on how to deal with climate change, the drop in confidence in economic growth is not surprising — even if the scale of the change in mood is,” said Bob Moritz, Chairman, of the PwC Network.

“These challenges facing the global economy are not new. However the scale of them and the speed at which some of them are escalating is new. The key issue for leaders gathering in Davos is: how are we going to come together to tackle them?”

PwC conducted 1,581 interviews, mainly online, with CEOs in 83 countries between September and October 2019. It weights the sample by national GDP to ensure that CEOs’ views are fairly represented across all major regions."
Heat wave kills nearly 1 million birds in the biggest known die-off of its kind,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2020-01-16/blob-seabird-murre-die-off-climate-change-marine-heatwave/11867264,"Back in 2015–16, about 62,000 dead or dying common murres — a North Pacific seabird — washed ashore between Alaska and California.

Key points: Food for the birds disappeared in the warmer conditions while competition increased

Food for the birds disappeared in the warmer conditions while competition increased Warm conditions have returned to waters off Alaska and the Bering Sea

Warm conditions have returned to waters off Alaska and the Bering Sea It's too early to know whether Australia's mutton bird populations have crashed

Only a fraction of the dead birds made it to shore, and the total number of deaths was estimated to be close to a million birds.

Researchers think it was the largest seabird die-off in recorded history.

Compounding the deaths, at least 22 colonies completely failed to produce any offspring over several breeding seasons.

Now a major study has concluded that the die-off was the result of a huge disruption to energy flow through food webs, precipitated by ""the blob"" — an unprecedented mass of warm, nutrient-poor water that emerged off the Pacific coast of the US from 2013.

The blob was up to 6 degrees Celsius above typical maximum temperatures in places and extended to a depth of 200 metres, and more than 3,000 kilometres up the US coastline into Alaska.

As well as the huge seabird die-off, the researchers believe the marine heatwave caused the mass mortality of a suite of other fish, mammal and bird species during 2014–17.

During the period that the blob persisted off the coast of the US, production of phytoplankton or microscopic algae dropped, and ""the largest harmful algal bloom in recorded history"" stretched from California to the Gulf of Alaska in 2015, the researchers said.

""A massive die-off of planktivorous Cassin's auklets [seabirds] occurred from Central California to British Columbia in the winter of 2014-15, a marked increase in mortality of [sea lions] was noted in Southern California, and an unusually large die-off of baleen whales occurred in the Gulf of Alaska in 2015–16,"" they wrote in their paper, published today in PLOS ONE.

An 'ectothermic vice' squeezed the birds' food supply

Their study used a combination of data gathered by citizen scientists, government, university and private organisations, and wildlife rehabilitation centres, to conclude that the common murres were caught in an ""ectothermic vice"" — basically, a squeezing of the murre's food supply from above and below.

On the one side, the murre's preferred prey species, fish like anchovies, juvenile salmon, capelin and sardines, are ectothermic or cold-blooded.

Warmer ocean temperatures increased their metabolic rate, said lead author John Piatt from the US Geological Survey.

""If you crank up the temperature a few degrees, these ectothermic fish, their metabolic rate cranks up and so they had to eat more,"" he said.

But at the same time, food for the fish like zooplankton, had been diminished by the warmer temperatures, and the fish suffered accordingly.

""A lot of forage [fish] species did poorly. Juvenile salmon lost body condition because as it turns out their diets were impacted,"" Dr Piatt said.

""The quality of the food they wanted to eat was getting poor.""

Not only were there fewer fish for the murre to eat, but because the fish were smaller and in worse physical condition, the murre needed to catch and eat more to survive.

On the other side of the ""vice"" were the murre's competitors — ectothermic or cold-blooded fish like Pacific cod and halibut, which compete with the murre for food.

""The big fish, the big cod, the flounders and the pollock, these large predatory fish, their metabolic rates went up too,"" Dr Piatt said.

Increased competition for food meant the murre — which has been recorded diving to depths of up to 180 metres — had to work extra hard to sustain themselves.

Murres are highly energetic, and need to consume around 56 per cent of their own body mass every day to meet their own energy demands.

""These are high-energy birds with high-energy demands. If they don't eat for three to four days they're dead,"" Dr Piatt said.

The result was the biggest seabird die-off or ""wreck"" that scientists know of.

Did Australia's mutton birds suffer the same fate?

Late last year, as only trickles of mutton birds showed up at their regular southern Australian roosting sites, ecologists feared the worst.

For some reason, many had failed to make the annual migration from Alaska.

Birdwatcher Peter Barrand told the ABC at the time that we could be ""looking at an extinction event"".

Because seabirds have large natural population fluctuations year on year, it's too early to say the drop in mutton bird numbers last year was anything more than a blip, said John Arnould of Deakin University, who wasn't involved in this study.

Puffin numbers crashed in 2014. ( Supplied: Andrew Peacock )

""We'll have a better idea in March when we do the annual monitoring,"" Professor Arnould said.

""There were visibly fewer animals but that varies from year to year. I'm cautious about saying the sky is falling, but there's no doubt that fewer animals came back.""

Because of the difficulty in detecting rapid declines in species that have big natural population variability, Australia needs to increase its monitoring, he said.

""To understand what's happening in the environment you have to monitor regularly,"" he said.

""Long-term monitoring in Australia could be better funded. You have to factor in natural environmental variability overlaid with changing climate impacts.""

A study published this week showed that 2019 was the hottest year in recorded history for our oceans, a trend that is predicted to continue as climate change intensifies.

And ocean warming has been greatest in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans.

In late 2019, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that the blob had reformed off the west coast of the US.

While seabird wrecks have occurred historically, Dr Piatt discovered during his research records of just two other mass die-offs comparable in size to the event he was studying.

""As we looked we discovered that there were actually two very large die-offs in the 2010s — in this decade,"" he said.

""One of them was off the coast of New Zealand. Then there was the die-off of puffins off the coast of France in 2014. They lost 50 to 60 per cent of puffins.

""What do they have in common? They all happened in the 2010s and that's been the warmest decade.

""It's not me saying it, it's oceanographers saying it.

Adding to this, the most affluent groups have higher incomes than expenditure, and their saving and investing leads to substantial additional environmental impact38. Therefore, and due to significant inter- and intra-national wealth and income inequality36,39, we differentiate between globally affluent groups, such as the European Union, and the most wealthy and affluent groups within countries, e.g. the <1–10% richest income segments36. As quantitative research36,40,41 shows, highly affluent consumers drive biophysical resource use (a) directly through high consumption, (b) as members of powerful factions of the capitalist class and (c) through driving consumption norms across the population. The next sections focus on affluent groups globally and on the intra-nationally most wealthy and affluent segments (hereafter called super-affluent).

Reducing overconsumption

Since the level of consumption determines total impacts, affluence needs to be addressed by reducing consumption, not just greening it17,28,29. It is clear that prevailing capitalist, growth-driven economic systems have not only increased affluence since World War II, but have led to enormous increases in inequality, financial instability, resource consumption and environmental pressures on vital earth support systems42. A suitable concept to address the ecological dimension is the widely established avoid-shift-improve framework outlined by Creutzig et al.43. Its focus on the end-use service, such as mobility, nutrition or shelter, allows for a multi-dimensional analysis of potential impact reductions beyond sole technological change. This analysis can be directed at human need satisfaction or decent living standards—an alternative perspective put forward for curbing environmental crises44,45. Crucially, this perspective allows us to consider different provisioning systems (e.g. states, markets, communities and households) and to differentiate between superfluous consumption, which is consumption that does not contribute to needs satisfaction, and necessary consumption which can be related to satisfying human needs. It remains important to acknowledge the complexities surrounding this distinction, as touched upon in the sections on growth imperatives below. Still, empirically, human needs satisfaction shows rapidly diminishing returns with overall consumption45,46.

As implied by the previous section on affluence as a driver, the strongest pillar of the necessary transformation is to avoid or to reduce consumption until the remaining consumption level falls within planetary boundaries, while fulfilling human needs17,28,46. Avoiding consumption means not consuming certain goods and services, from living space (overly large homes, secondary residences of the wealthy) to oversized vehicles, environmentally damaging and wasteful food, leisure patterns and work patterns involving driving and flying47. This implies reducing expenditure and wealth along ‘sustainable consumption corridors’, i.e. minimum and maximum consumption standards48,49 (Fig. 2). On the technological side, reducing the need for consumption can be facilitated by changes such as increasing lifespans of goods, telecommunication instead of physical travel, sharing and repairing instead of buying new, and house retrofitting43.

Fig. 2: The safe and just space for humanity. Sustainable lifestyles are situated between an upper limit of permissible use (“Environmental ceiling”) and a lower limit of necessary use of environmental resources (“Social foundation”) (figures from ref. 49 and ref. 84 combined and adapted). Full size image

However, the other two pillars of shift and improve are still vital to achieve the socio-ecological transformation46. Consumption patterns still need to be shifted away from resource and carbon-intensive goods and services, e.g. mobility from cars and airplanes to public buses and trains, biking or walking, heating from oil heating to heat pumps, nutrition—where possible—from animal to seasonal plant-based products43,46. In some cases this includes a shift from high- to low-tech (with many low-tech alternatives being less energy intense than high-tech equivalents, e.g. clothes line vs. dryer) and from global to local47. In parallel, also the resource and carbon intensity of consumption needs to be decreased, e.g. by expanding renewable energy, electrifying cars and public transport and increasing energy and material efficiency43,46.

The avoid-shift-improve framework, coherently applied with a dominant avoid and strong shift, implies the adoption of less affluent, simpler and sufficiency-oriented lifestyles to address overconsumption—consuming better but less46,47,49,50. This also includes addressing socially unsustainable underconsumption in impoverished communities in both less affluent and affluent countries, where enough and better is needed to achieve a more equal distribution of wealth and guarantee a minimum level of prosperity to overcome poverty48,49. Thus, establishing a floor-and-ceiling strategy of sustainable consumption corridors is necessary48,49 (Fig. 2).

It is well established that at least in the affluent countries a persistent, deep and widespread reduction of consumption and production would reduce economic growth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP)51,52. Estimates of the needed reduction of resource and energy use in affluent countries, resulting in a concomitant decrease in GDP of similar magnitude, range from 40 to 90%53,54. Bottom-up studies, such as from Rao et al.55 show that decent living standards could be maintained in India, Brazil and South Africa with around 90% less per-capita energy use than currently consumed in affluent countries. Trainer56, for Australia, and Lockyer57, for the USA, find similar possible reductions. In current capitalist economies such reduction pathways would imply widespread economic recession with a cascade of currently socially detrimental effects, such as a collapse of the stock market, unemployment, firm bankruptcies and lack of credit50,58. The question then becomes how such a reduction in consumption and production can be made socially sustainable, safeguarding human needs and social function50,59 However, to address this question, we first need to understand the various growth imperatives of capitalist social and economic systems and the role of the super-affluent segments of society60.

Super-affluent consumers and growth imperatives

Growth imperatives are active at multiple levels, making the pursuit of economic growth (net investment, i.e. investment above depreciation) a necessity for different actors and leading to social and economic instability in the absence of it7,52,60. Following a Marxian perspective as put forward by Pirgmaier and Steinberger61, growth imperatives can be attributed to capitalism as the currently dominant socio-economic system in affluent countries7,51,62, although this is debated by other scholars52. To structure this topic, we will discuss different affected actors separately, namely corporations, states and individuals, following Richters and Siemoneit60. Most importantly, we address the role of the super-affluent consumers within a society, which overlap with powerful fractions of the capitalist class. From a Marxian perspective, this social class is structurally defined by its position in the capitalist production process, as financially tied with the function of capital63. In capitalism, workers are separated from the means of production, implying that they must compete in labour markets to sell their labour power to capitalists in order to earn a living.

Even though some small- and medium-sized businesses manage to refrain from pursuing growth, e.g. due to a low competition intensity in niche markets, or lack of financial debt imperatives, this cannot be said for most firms64. In capitalism, firms need to compete in the market, leading to a necessity to reinvest profits into more efficient production processes to minimise costs (e.g. through replacing human labour power with machines and positive returns to scale), innovation of new products and/or advertising to convince consumers to buy more7,61,62. As a result, the average energy intensity of labour is now twice as high as in 195060. As long as a firm has a competitive advantage, there is a strong incentive to sell as much as possible. Financial markets are crucial to enable this constant expansion by providing (interest-bearing) capital and channelling it where it is most profitable58,61,63. If a firm fails to stay competitive, it either goes bankrupt or is taken over by a more successful business. Under normal economic conditions, this capitalist competition is expected to lead to aggregate growth dynamics7,62,63,65.

However, two factors exist that further strengthen this growth dynamic60. Firstly, if labour productivity continuously rises, then aggregate economic growth becomes necessary to keep employment constant, otherwise technological unemployment results. This creates one of the imperatives for capitalist states to foster aggregate growth, since with worsening economic conditions and high unemployment, tax revenues shrink, e.g. from labour and value-added taxes, while social security expenditures rise60,62. Adding to this, states compete with other states geopolitically and in providing favourable conditions for capital, while capitalists have the resources to influence political decisions in their favour. If economic conditions are expected to deteriorate, e.g. due to unplanned recession or progressive political change, firms can threaten capital flight, financial markets react and investor as well as consumer confidence shrink51,58,60. Secondly, consumers usually increase their consumption in tune with increasing production60. This process can be at least in part explained by substantial advertising efforts by firms47,52,66. However, further mechanisms are at play as explained further below.

Following this analysis, it is not surprising that the growth paradigm is hegemonic, i.e. the perception that economic growth solves all kinds of societal problems, that it equals progress, power and welfare and that it can be made practically endless through some form of supposedly green or sustainable growth59. Taken together, the described dynamics create multiple dependencies of workers, firms and states on a well-functioning capital accumulation and thus wield more material, institutional and discursive power (e.g. for political lobbying) to capitalists who are usually the most affluent consumers61,67. Even if different fractions of the capitalist class have manifold and competing interests which need to be constantly renegotiated, there is a common interest in maintaining the capitalist system and favourable conditions for capital accumulation, e.g. through aggregate growth and high consumption51,62. How this political corruption by the super-affluent plays out in practice is well documented, e.g. for the meat industry in Denmark6.

Super-affluent consumers drive consumption norms

Growth imperatives and drivers (with the latter describing less coercive mechanisms to increase consumption) can also be active at the individual level. In this case, the level of consumption can serve as a proxy47,60,68. To start with, individual consumption decisions are not made in a vacuum, but are shaped by surrounding (physical and social) structures and provisioning systems47,61,69. Sanne66 and Alexander47 discuss several structural barriers to sufficiency-oriented lifestyles, locking in high consumption. These include lack of suitable housing, insufficient options for socialising, employment, transport and information, as well as high exposure to consumer temptations. Often, these conditions are deliberately fostered by states and also capitalists (the latter overlapping with super-affluent consumers and having disproportionate influence on states) to increase consumption61,66.

Further active mechanisms to spur growth include positional and efficiency consumption, which contribute to an increase in consumption overall52,60,68,70. After basic material needs are satisfied, an increasing proportion of consumption is directed at positional goods52,70. The defining feature of these goods is that they are expensive and signify social status. Access to them depends on the income relative to others. Status matters, since empirical studies show that currently relative income is one of the strongest determinants of individual happiness52. In the aggregate however, the pursuit of positional consumption, driven by super-affluent consumers and high inequalities, likely resembles a zero-sum game with respect to societal wellbeing70,71. With every actor striving to increase their position relative to their peers, the average consumption level rises and thus even more expensive positional goods become necessary, while the societal wellbeing level stagnates42,71. This is supported by a large body of empirical research, showing that an individual’s happiness correlates positively with their own income but negatively with the peer group’s income71 and that unequal access to positional goods fosters rising consumption52. This endless process is a core part of capitalism as it keeps social momentum and consumption high with affluent consumers driving aspirations and hopes of social ascent in low-affluence segments70,72. The positional consumption behaviour of the super-affluent thus drives consumption norms across the population, for instance through their excessive air travel, as documented by Gössling73.

Lastly, in capitalism, workers must compete against each other in the labour market in order to earn a living from capitalists7,63. Following Siemoneit68, this can lead to a similar imperative to net invest (increase the level of consumption/investment) as is observed with capitalists. In order to stay competitive, individuals are pushed to increase time and cost efficiency by investing in cars, kitchen appliances, computers and smartphones, by using social media and online trade etc. This efficiency consumption—effectively another facet of the rebound effect38,47,68—helps to manage high workloads, thus securing an income, while maintaining private life. This is often accompanied by trends of commodification61, understood as the marketisation of products and services which used to be provisioned through more time-intensive commons or reciprocal social arrangements, e.g. convenience food vs. cooking together. As in the food example74, this replacement of human labour with energy- and material-intensive industrial production typically increases environmental pressures47,75. Through these economic pressures, positive feedback loops and lock-ins are expected to emerge, since other consumers need to keep up with these investments or face disadvantages, e.g. when car or smartphone ownership become presupposed. Taken together with positional consumption, structural barriers to sufficiency and the substantial advertising efforts by capitalists, these mechanisms explain to a large extent why consumers seem so willing to increase their consumption in accordance with increasing production60.

Solution approaches

In response to the aforementioned drivers of affluence, diverse solution approaches and strategies are being discussed47,52,76. We differentiate these as belonging to a more reformist and a more radical group (Table 1). This is based on the categorisation by Alexander and Rutherford77. All these approaches differ from the established green growth (ecomodernism) approach28,78,79, in that they at least adopt an agnostic, if not negative, position on the question whether or not GDP can be sufficiently decoupled from environmental impacts28,52,78,80. Hence, these approaches also differ from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), since SDG 8 aims for continued global GDP growth of ~3% p.a., likely contradicting several other SDGs, e.g. SDG 12 and 1381,82,83. Further, the SDGs are not representing a theoretically coherent framework, since they are part of a deliberative process45, and sideline underlying power dynamics as well as interactions between injustices83. Nevertheless, approaches underpinned by multi-dimensional social wellbeing and environmental goals, such as Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics84, are strong alternatives to GDP-focused ones and may inspire transformative change in the context of the more reformist solution approaches outlined below. Importantly, the following discussion can only provide a rough overview of the respective approaches.

Table 1 Meta approaches for sustainable prosperity. Full size table

The reformist group consists of heterogeneous approaches such as a-growth80, precautionary/pragmatic post-growth52, prosperity42 and managing85 without growth as well as steady-state economics86. These approaches have in common that they aim to achieve the required socio-ecological transformation through and within today’s dominant institutions, such as centralised democratic states and market economies52,77. From this position it often follows that current, socially vital institutions, such as the welfare state, labour markets, healthcare, pensions and others, need to be reformed to become independent from GDP growth52. Generally, bottom-up movements are seen as crucial, leading to value and cultural changes towards sufficiency42,47. Eventually, however, significant policy changes are proposed to achieve the necessary downshifting of consumption and production42,77,86 and/or the reduction of environmental impacts through decoupling52,80. These include, among others, stringent eco-taxes or cap-and trade systems, directed investments in green industries and public institutions, wealth redistribution through taxation and a maximum income, a guaranteed basic income and/or reduced working hours42,77. Although these policies already seem radical when compared to today’s policies, the proponents of reformist approaches are convinced that the transformation can be achieved in current capitalist economies and democratic states42,77,86.

The second, more radical, group disagrees and argues that the needed socio-ecological transformation will necessarily entail a shift beyond capitalism and/or current centralised states. Although comprising considerable heterogeneity77, it can be divided into eco-socialist approaches, viewing the democratic state as an important means to achieve the socio-ecological transformation51,65 and eco-anarchist approaches, aiming instead at participatory democracy without a state, thus minimising hierarchies54,87. Many degrowth approaches combine elements of the two, but often see a stronger role for state action than eco-anarchists50,51,88. Degrowth is defined here as “an equitable downscaling of throughput [that is the energy and resource flows through an economy, strongly coupled to GDP], with a concomitant securing of wellbeing“59,p7, aimed at a subsequent downscaled steady-state economic system that is socially just and in balance with ecological limits. Importantly, degrowth does not aim for a reduction of GDP per se, but rather accepts it as a likely outcome of the necessary changes78. Moreover, eco-feminist approaches highlight the role of patriarchal social relations and the parallels between the oppression of women and exploitation of nature89, while post-development approaches stress the manifold and heterogeneous visions of achieving such a socio-ecological transformation globally, especially in the global South90.

Degrowth advocates propose similar policy changes as the reformist group50,80. However, it is stressed that implementing these changes would most likely imply a shift beyond capitalism, e.g. preventing capital accumulation through dis-economies of scale and collective firm ownership, and thus require radical social change59,62,91. Eco-socialists usually focus more on rationing, planning of investments and employment, price controls and public ownership of at least the most central means of production to plan their downscaling in a socially sustainable way65,77.

Both groups agree on the crucial role of bottom-up movements to change culture and values, push for the implementation of these top-down changes and establish parts of the new economy within the old47,50. Finally, eco-anarchists do not view the state as a central means to achieve the socio-ecological transformation. Instead, they stress the role of bottom-up grassroots initiatives, such as transition initiatives and eco-villages, in prefiguring the transformation as well as cultural and value changes as a necessary precondition for wider radical change. With these initiatives scaling up, the state might get used to remove barriers and to support establishing a participatory-democratic and localised post-capitalist economy54,77.

In summary, there seems to be some strategic overlap between reformist and the more radical eco-anarchist and eco-socialist approaches, at least in the short term77. The question remains how these solution approaches help in overcoming the capitalist dynamics previously outlined, since here bottom-up and governmental action seem to be limited. It is important to recognise the pivotal role of social movements in this process, which can bring forward social tipping points through complex, unpredictable and reinforcing feedbacks92,93 and create windows of opportunity from crises77,94."
"2009 scientists: ""Stop freaking out about Antarctic ice. That baby is solid under all models."" 2019 scientists: ""Our bad. West Antarctica has passed the tipping point.""",https://phys.org/news/2019-09-antarctica-crumbling-ice-sheet-redraw.html,"In Antarctica, 99 percent of all ice loss occurs when ice slides into the ocean

The fate of the world's coastal regions and the hundreds of millions of people who inhabit them depend on a block of ice atop West Antarctica on track to lift global oceans by at least three metres.

It is not, according to available science, a matter of ""if"" but ""when"".

Anders Levermann, a professor at the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research in Germany and a top expert on Antarctica, spoke to AFP -– days before the release in Monaco of a major UN report on oceans and Earth's frozen zones -– about how climate change is impacting the world's coldest region.

Q. Does global warming affect Greenland and Antarctica the same way?

No. In Antarctica, 99 percent of all ice loss occurs when ice slides into the ocean. There is practically no ice melt on the surface –- it is simply too cold.

In Greenland, half of the ice loss is due to melt water that runs into the ocean.

When ice in Antarctica or Greenland slides into the ocean and becomes an ice shelf, it comes into contact with surface water. Even a tenth of a degree increase in the temperature of the water can lead to a significant ice sheet imbalance.

Greenland's ice sheet is much smaller than Antarctica's –- seven metres of sea level equivalent vs. 55 -– but sheds even more mass. That is because Antarctica, even if its topography has fewer barriers, is so much colder.

West Antarctica's ice sheet has shed about 150 billion tonnes of mass every year since 2005

Q. What do we know about Antarctica that we didn't know a decade ago?

Ten years ago the modelling of Antarctica showed no significant ice loss within this century. Indeed, there was some debate as to whether the continent might add ice mass.

Today, all the ice sheet models lose ice at a significant rate. The continent's ice sheet has shed about 150 billion tonnes of mass every year since 2005, virtually all of it in West Antarctica. Ice loss in both Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating.

There is no longer any ambiguity. The studies we have in hand tell us that West Antarctica has passed a tipping point. It has become unstable and will discharge all its most vulnerable ice into the ocean. Period.

Q. How much will Antarctica add to sea level rise by 2100?

A study I did with numerous colleagues in 2014 estimated that we could get 50 centimetres of sea level from Antarctica by 2100 –- which is huge. The last assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said 16 cm was the upward limit.

In 2016 an important study published in Nature –- introducing new physical processes –- proposed an even higher contribution, of up to more than a metre. That study has been much criticised, and the findings may be revised.

Hamburg, Calcutta and Shanghai -– we are going to lose them all to sea level rise if we do not stop emitting carbon into the atmosphere

Q. What will happen after 2100?

In 2100, nothing stops.

If we keep to the Paris Agreement, sea level rise will at best slow down. If we don't, it will still be accelerating at the end of the century.

The most vulnerable part of the West Antarctic ice sheet -– equivalent to 3.5 metres of sea level rise -– sits in depressions below sea level, where ocean water infiltrates and erodes the ice sheet from underneath.

Q. How long will it take for the ice sheet to disappear?

I think we are underestimating the speed. That said, for all of the W. Antarctic ice sheet to discharge, it will take centuries. But it won't stop.

Q. How worried should we be?

Nobody should fear for their life because of rising seas. But if New York winds up five metres below sea level behind dikes and levees, I don't know if people will want to live there.

The most vulnerable part of the West Antarctic ice sheet -– equivalent to 3.5 metres of sea level rise -– sits in depressions below sea level, where ocean water infiltrates and erodes the ice sheet from underneath

The real impact is what we will lose. Hong Kong is currently a beacon of democracy in China. New Orleans is a bastion of culture, and New York of culture and business. Hamburg, Calcutta and Shanghai -– we are going to lose them all to sea level rise if we do not stop emitting carbon into the atmosphere.

Q. Why is Antarctica harder to figure out than Greenland?

Unlike the Greenland ice sheet, ice loss in Antarctica is not due to melting, but to a discharge of icebergs into the ocean. Getting it right is difficult -– at first, we were unable to model and observe this process.

The first satellite images for West Antarctica are from 1992. So when we began to see ice loss there a decade ago, we had less than 20 years of data. That's not long enough to detect long-term trends.

Ice sheets change over a long time scale, so observations can be very misleading.

Antarctica is shielded from the rest of the world by the strongest ocean current on the planet, and the situation is similar for the atmosphere. That is also hard to factor in.

Explore further Arctic ice loss is worrying, but the giant stirring in the South could be even worse

Billionaires Are the Leading Cause of Climate Change,https://www.gq.com/story/billionaires-climate-change?verso=true&fbclid=IwAR3IN8zJlJnJoRt3ObhssdebAST60cV50fNOx7JZ1KPU7-CGOuzF43i8qAE,"This week, the United Nations released a damning report. The short version: We have about 12 years to actually do something to prevent the worst aspects of climate change. That is, not to prevent climate change—we're well past that point—but to prevent the worst, most catastrophic elements of it from wreaking havoc on the world's population. To do that, the governments of Earth need to look seriously at the forces driving it. And an honest assessment of how we got here lays the blame squarely at the feet of the 1 percent.

Contrary to a lot of guilt-tripping pleas for us all to take the bus more often to save the world, your individual choices are probably doing very little to the world's climate. The real impact comes on the industrial level, as more than 70 percent of global emissions come from just 100 companies. So you, a random American consumer, exert very little pressure here. The people who are actively cranking up the global thermostat and threatening to drown 20 percent of the global population are the billionaires in the boardrooms of these companies.

There are probably no individuals who have had a more toxic impact on public and political attitudes about climate change than the Koch brothers, and it would take an absurd amount of space to document all the money and organizations they've scraped together for that purpose. (Investigative reporter Jane Mayer's groundbreaking Dark Money does basically that.) And they have every reason to: In her book, Mayer notes that ""Koch Industries alone routinely released some 24 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year.""

But the scope goes far beyond merely sowing dissent and skepticism. While billionaires and the companies they run have spent years insisting that climate change either doesn't exist or is overblown, they've known the reality of the situation for a long time. PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, for example, used to donate to the Seasteading Institute, which aimed to build floating cities in order to counteract rising sea levels. And Exxon Mobil allegedly knew about climate change in 1977, back when it was still just Exxon and about 11 years before climate change became widely talked about. Instead of acting on it, they started a decades-long misinformation campaign. According to Scientific American, Exxon helped create the Global Climate Coalition, which questioned the scientific basis for concern over climate change from the late '80s until 2002, and successfully worked to keep the U.S. from signing the Kyoto Protocol, a move that helped cause India and China, two other massive sources of greenhouse gas, to avoid signing.

Even when Republican lawmakers show flashes of willingness to get something done, they're swiftly swatted down. There are myriad examples, but one example comes via Dark Money, where Mayer describes an incident in April 2010 when Lindsey Graham briefly tried to support a cap-and-trade bill: A political group called American Solutions promptly launched a negative PR campaign against him, and Graham folded after just a few days. American Solutions, it turns out, was backed by billionaires in fossil fuel and other industries, including Trump-loving casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.

In recent years, fossil-fuel companies have tried to cast themselves as being on the same side of the general public. Just this month, Exxon pledged $1 million to fight for a carbon tax, a stopgap measure that charges a fee of $40 per ton of carbon produced and increases as production goes up. At a glance, that may seem magnanimous, but the truth is that Exxon can afford the tax. Not only is the oil and gas industry experiencing a serious boom right now, companies know that the only real solutions to climate change will hurt them even more than a measly tax."
Humanity Has Killed 83% of All Wild Mammals and Half of All Plants,https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/humans-destroyed-83-of-wildlife-report/,"Photo by Tom Skarbek-Wazynski on Unsplash

When it comes to planet Earth, humans are very tiny.

The weight of all 7.6 billion humans makes up just 0.01% of all biomass on Earth, according to a report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.

Bacteria, by comparison, make up 13% of all biomass, plants account for 83%, and all other forms of life make up 5% of the total weight, according to the report.

Take Action: Stand Up for the Arctic

Despite being such a small part of the planet, humans have been steadily destroying everything else for the past few millennia, the Guardian reports.

In fact, humans have caused the annihilation of 83% of all wild mammals and half of all plants, the authors of the report found.

And it’s not just that humans are wiping out wildlife — they’re also determining the animals and plants that remain.

Of the birds left in the world, 70% are poultry chickens and other farmed birds. And of the mammals left in the world, 60% are livestock, 36% are pigs, and a mere 4% are wild.

Marine mammals, meanwhile, have plunged by 80% over the past century, the report found.

“It is definitely striking, our disproportionate place on Earth,” Ron Milo, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who led the report, told the Guardian. “When I do a puzzle with my daughters, there is usually an elephant next to a giraffe next to a rhino. But if I was trying to give them a more realistic sense of the world, it would be a cow next to a cow next to a cow and then a chicken.”

This staggering imbalance between domestic and wild animals is being driven by industrial farming, extraction of resources, and the expansion of human civilizations, all of which destroy ecosystems, according to the report.

Other studies have also documented the decline of animals and plants. For instance, scientists recently argued that the Earth is experiencing its sixth mass wave of extinction, with billions of local animal populations endangered around the world.

This decline is by no means slowing down. A study published last week found that if temperatures at the end of the century are 3.2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, species across the animal kingdom could lose up to half of their geographical ranges.

The study spearheaded by Milo, however, is the first taxonomic breakdown of the mass of all organisms on Earth, according to the authors, who noted that further research and advances in technology need to be developed to refine the data.

“I would hope this gives people a perspective on the very dominant role that humanity now plays on Earth,” Milo told the Guardian.

"The Independent: The WHO warns that countries around the world must be prepared for a second or third wave of COVID-19, until a vaccine is available.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-come-back-second-wave-who-europe-hans-kluge-a9493286.html,"Countries around the world must be prepared for a “second or third wave” of the coronavirus until a vaccine is available, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.

Europe remains “very much in the grip” of the pandemic, despite positive signs it was passing the peak, said Dr Hans Kluge, the head of the WHO in Europe.

“Covid-19 is not going away any time soon,” he added.

It comes after the University of Oxford announced it was partnering with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for the development, manufacture and large-scale distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate currently being trialled in the UK.

Speaking during a WHO Europe briefing, Dr Kluge said: “One of the things we saw very clearly in different countries is the speed with which even the best health systems can be overwhelmed and devastated.

“So the biggest lesson overall at this stage would be that health really deserves to be at the top of the political agenda.

“Health is a driver of the economy — what we see now is that without health, there is no economy. Without health, there is no national security.

“Once we get out of the pandemic, through united efforts, this is a lesson never to be forgotten.”

The UK remains under strict lockdown measures, with the latest figures showing 26,771 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after contracting Covid-19.

Elsewhere in Europe, other countries have begun easing restrictions by allowing shops to reopen and people to leave their homes.

Dr Kluge said it was vital for countries to prepare for future outbreaks once the first peak had been reached.

He said: “If the first wave is gone, [the key issue is] that we have bought the time to prepare for a second or third wave, particularly if there is no vaccine.

“The key issue is to be prepared whether it is for a second wave or another outbreak of another future infectious agent.

“This will require the collaboration and understanding of everyone, not least with the summer coming, that everyone has to do its share while moving to a new reality where public health has to have a more prominent place in society.”

Dr Kluge said Europe accounted for nearly half (46 per cent) of all cases globally, and nearly two-thirds (63 per cent) of all deaths."
"By 2050, the U.S. will lose $83 billion a year because of all the nature we’ve destroyed",https://www.fastcompany.com/90463133/by-2050-the-u-s-will-lose-83-billion-a-year-because-of-all-the-nature-weve-destroyed,"The world economy depends on nature, from coral reefs that protect coastal cities from flooding to insects that pollinate crops. But by the middle of the century, the loss of key “ecosystem services” could cost the world $479 billion each year. The U.S. will lose more than any other country, with an $83 billion loss to the GDP per year by 2050.

That’s a conservative estimate. The projection comes from a report, called Global Futures, from World Wildlife Fund, which looked at only six of the services that nature provides and how those might change because of the impacts of climate breakdown, lost wildlife habitat, and other human-caused destruction of nature. (Many other services will also be impacted but can’t currently be accurately modeled; the study also doesn’t take into account the possibility of tipping points that lead to sudden, catastrophic losses of natural services.) By 2050, if the world continues on its current path, the global economy could lose $327 billion a year as we lose natural coastal protection from coral reefs, mangrove forests, and other natural systems. Another $128 billion could be lost annually from forests and peatlands that store carbon. Agriculture could lose $15 billion from lost pollinators and $19 billion from reduced water availability. Food costs are likely to go up, threatening food security in some regions.

In the U.S., the biggest losses will come from lost coastal protection and losses in marine fisheries. Because of the size of the U.S. economy, it will lose most in absolute terms. But developing countries will be hit hardest in terms of the percentage of GDP lost; Madagascar tops that list, followed by Togo, Vietnam, and Mozambique.

If the world radically changes course to more sustainable development, protecting areas that are most critical for biodiversity and ecosystem services, the global annual GDP could, instead, grow $11 billion by 2050. Businesses can help this happen by taking steps to make sure their supply chains aren’t damaging tropical forests and other key ecosystems, the report says. The nonprofit is also advocating for a “New Deal for Nature and People” that would help stop and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. The current situation is bleak: Around half of the world’s corals have been lost in the last three decades. An average of around 12 million hectares of tropical forest has been lost each year in the last decade. More than 40% of insect species are at risk of extinction in the next few decades—and overall, a U.N. report last year estimated that humans have managed to put more than 1 million species at risk of extinction."
Dow drops 600 points even after Fed slashes rates to combat coronavirus,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/dow-futures-rise-about-150-points-in-early-trading-extending-mondays-huge-comeback-rally.html,"Stocks fell sharply in volatile trading on Tuesday as an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to assuage concerns of slower economic growth due to the coronavirus outbreak. The decision to cut rates by half a percentage point came two weeks before the Fed's scheduled meeting as the central bank felt it was necessary to act quickly to combat the effect of the virus spreading worldwide. It's the first such emergency action coming in between scheduled meetings since the financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 785.91 points lower, or nearly 3%, to 25,917.41; it rose more than 300 points earlier in the day. The 30-stock average gyrated between sharp gains and solid losses after the decision was announced. The S&P 500 fell 2.8% to 3,003.37 while the Nasdaq Composite pulled back 3% to 8,684.09. Investors, in turn, loaded up on U.S. Treasurys, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield below 1% for the first time ever. Gold, meanwhile, jumped 2.9% to settle at $1,644.40 per ounce. ""It's great that the Federal Reserve recognizes that there's going to be weakness, but it makes me feel, wow, the weakness must be much more than I thought,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street"" right after the sudden cut. ""I'm now nervous. I'm more nervous than I was before.""

Traders had already priced in a rate cut of 50 basis points by this month's policy meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted the central bank was not prepared to use any additional tools to stimulate the economy aside from rate cuts. This may have disappointed some on Wall Street who were expecting something more from the central bank. Bank shares fell broadly as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hit a record low. Bank of America dropped more than 5.5% while JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup slid 3.8% each. The 10-year rate hit a low of 0.906%. ""The market is still trying to find its footing,"" said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, in a note. ""The panicked collapse of the last week isn't something that will be quickly forgotten, and it will take a couple of weeks (at least) before stocks are on firmer ground."""
California's Mega-Fires Have Arrived 30 Years Early,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/californias-mega-fires-have-arrived-30-years-early/,"Scientists predicted climate change would fuel the kind of devastating wildfires that California has seen this year. Except it wasn’t expected to happen for decades.

A major analysis by state researchers projected that the amount of area burned by wildfire could jump 77% by the end of the century. Another study by UCLA warned that by 2050 fire on average would scorch twice as much land in Southern California.

A doubling happened this year, instead of three decades from now.

California blazes have blackened 4.1 million acres this year, compared with about 2 million acres in 2018. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) calls it a climate “fast-forward” and a warning for the nation, said Wade Crowfoot, the state Natural Resources Agency secretary.

“Frankly, we’re alarmed because this wildfire destruction that we’re seeing in 2020 is the type of destruction that we anticipated experiencing later in the century,” Crowfoot said in an interview.

In response, the state is boosting actions to curb greenhouse gas pollution faster than planned, Crowfoot said, because “these climate risks, these climate-driven threats that we thought would get worse in coming decades, are worse already.”

The recent fires prompted Newsom to ban the sale of new gas-fueled cars in the state beginning in 2036 (E&E News PM, Sept. 23). He also wants to preserve one-third of state lands and coastal waters to sequester greenhouse gas emissions (Climatewire, Oct. 8).

It takes place as climate change-heightened disasters arrive sooner than anticipated around the world, researchers said. Arctic ice sheets are melting rapidly, and parts of Siberia hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit in July for the first time (Climatewire, July 16).

Along the U.S. East and Gulf coasts, the intensity of hurricanes has been increasing due to warming waters and higher sea levels. Flooding in the Midwest last year devastated farms.

“Whether it’s floods or fires, we’ve just seen big steps upwards in terms of the nature of the impacts,” said Katharine Mach, a climate scientist with the University of Miami. “These impacts are taking societies by surprise. They shouldn’t, necessarily, because we knew this type of thing would happen.”

Scientists blame warming for record-breaking temperatures, less dependable precipitation and reduced moisture in the air, factors that helped create a tinderbox in the West. The landscape went up in flames when some 12,000 lightning strikes over one August weekend ignited more than 600 fires in Northern California.

Multiple studies warned that wildfires would burn significantly more land in the Golden State in years ahead.

The California Fourth Climate Change Assessment published last year found that the amount of land burned by blazes could leap 77% over the next 80 years.

The UCLA study, which included researchers from the University of California, Irvine, saw earlier impacts. Alex Hall, a climate scientist at UCLA, said the research outlined a gradual increase in fire severity leading up to the midcentury.

“The massive increase in wildfire size and intensity that we have seen over the past five years, maybe, especially over the past two or three years, is not something that was predicted by climate scientists,” Hall said of California fires.

When his paper was published in 2015, he said, “we thought we were being really apocalyptic” by predicting that the amount of area burned would double by 2050.

“I was worried about making a prediction that was too scary,” Hall said. “Turns out I should have been scarier.”

One year ‘does not make a trend’

Climate researchers caution that it’s not scientifically appropriate to look at just one year and compare that to forecasts in climate studies. Scientists look at potential changes over a number of years and compare those to model simulations for earlier time frames, said Leroy Westerling, a professor with the University of California, Merced, whose research went into California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment.

Contrasting that against one year’s fire damage is “something of an apples-to-apricots comparison,” he said.

California’s climate assessment relied on the findings of four climate models in its wildfire section, Westerling said. Those were “downscaled” from global studies to get potential impacts in California.

The models represented some potential cooler years with more precipitation, and other years that were warmer and drier. But none included years with California’s 2012-2015 drought, which was “the worst in at least the last 1,200 years,” Westerling said.

Hall, with UCLA, called it “a failure of climate science” that studies didn’t foresee an earlier arrival of more extreme fires. It happened in part, he said, because research has typically looked at how temperatures shaped historical fires and used that to project how further warming would change blazes in the future.

But what’s happened historically has not proved a good yardstick.

“What we’re seeing now are new types of behavior that have emerged as a result of climate change,” Hall said, adding that this behavior was “not seen in historical records.”

Local climate models traditionally looked at warming’s effects on air, water and soil, Hall said. They haven’t folded in ecological effects such as California’s decadeslong practice of suppressing fires, which allowed forests to expand. They also didn’t include the invasion of bark beetles that killed hundreds of thousands of trees, making them more flammable, he said.

Climate science is complex, and “one year does not make a trend,” said Crowfoot, California’s Natural Resources Agency secretary. But wildfires in recent years have shattered records for size, destruction and death toll.

“We can conclude with great certainty that impacts of these climate-driven threats are accelerated or are happening much sooner than we thought,” he said.

Scaring people

Climate research takes a lot of projections and finds a sort of ensemble average, which mutes extremes, said Max Moritz, wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension. Models also look at “bookends” such as a very wet or very dry future, “because we don’t know which is most likely,” he said.

“It could be that instead of throwing out the extremes, we should be looking at these very, very unusual but devastating futures,” Moritz added.

Climate scientists might hesitate to present the most extreme outcomes, he said, because they “want to deliver scenarios we can have policy and management responses to.” There’s a concern that “if you scare people with the most extreme projections, there might not be any response.”

Efforts at adaptation haven’t kept pace with accelerating climate impacts, said Mach, the University of Miami professor. When Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana in 2017, hospitals had emergency plans to respond. But there was a problem. Many people couldn’t get to the hospitals through flooded roads.

In California, where fires have happened for centuries, one could ask why the state wasn’t more prepared, Mach said. But it’s important to note climate change is just one part of the equation. The state’s practice of suppressing most fires sharpened the risk. And as housing prices soared, people built homes in more remote areas that are prone to burn.

“When you put all of that together, it is a system that is simply beyond its current limits, to manage the risk,” Mach said.

With more people living in wildland-adjacent areas, fires have a larger impact, said Margaret Torn, a senior scientist with the University of California, Berkeley.

“We’re changing how catastrophic a fire is because we have put more properties and lives at risk ... because we’re building in fire zones,” Torn said.

A Mad Society - How The Internet Is Driving Us Into Psychosis,https://mad.science.blog/2020/09/21/a-mad-society/,"Why might the internet turn society psychotic?

How does disagreement lead to madness?

Collision, Division, and Isolation

I have been thinking about a friend’s son that is starting to experience psychotic-like symptoms. We will call this individual Jon. He has become withdrawn, he is paranoid of coworkers at a new job, and he seems to struggle with reading people correctly. These problems can be explained by considering how social threat, fear loops, and ‘dysbeliefs’ interact to produce psychotic problems. The internet is facilitating this process and further atomizing in-real-life communities.

Social Threat

The first thing to consider in this situation is that feeling threatened turns off our empathy somewhat. This may be part of why Jon struggles with reading people correctly. Social threat biases the way we view other people so that they seem to have negative intentions or are hostile. This is often noticeable when you insult someone. They will quickly close up and start disagreeing with much of what you say and find rationalizations against your positions, even if they might usually agree with those ideas. Meanwhile, if people like each other, they will bias in favor of each other’s thinking and be open-minded and receptive to considering different opinions, but also vulnerable to dismissing their critical thought with the ideas of their ingroup.

I suspect that Jon may have initialized his social fear through experiences of being bullied, something that he did in fact face throughout life. There is often a fear loop that stems from being bullied or abused. This becomes important when talking about the internet since it has become normal for people to bully strangers on the internet. Most people in comment sections of certain internet places will feel primed to expect threat, hate, disagreement, uncivility and so on. What’s worse, someone who withdrawals from socializing due to bullies may find their way to the internet to cope, where there are even more bullies.

Much of these social threat patterns are reciprocal. If someone is acting mean online, our first instinct is to turn against them. As we turn against them, others observe us being mean and see it as unjust and then turn against us. It is a collision that exists on both sides.

Fear Loops

This fear that develops from bullying makes socializing very negative and aversive. This makes us want to avoid people. This makes us socially naïve because we must constantly engage in social connection in order to keep up with how people work and how they develop and change. This naivety that one has from a lack of social interaction can make predicting or understanding other people’s behavior harder.

The fear loop is essentially a feedback loop in which fear incentivizes isolation which brews further fear. It resembles the cycle of rejection. If you feel rejected or insulted by someone, your first instinct will be to return the negative attitude. If someone calls you stupid, you will feel threatened and compelled to reject that person with your own insults.

Being isolated can make us even more paranoid because we end up being left out of the constantly evolving cultures that guide most people’s social circles. So if your social group jokes about celebrities, talks about current events, gossips about other friends, or whatever it might be, the isolated person isn’t receiving information from their peers about these topics while they are isolated so their mind will drift away from these common topics and ideas of the social group. Then, often times the group will actually feel threatened by you and you will feel threatened by them. It’s like having the political left and right both meet for coffee. They might get edgy, paranoid, or even insult each other.

People are often times afraid of differences because it challenges their own perspectives. As an example, if you spend time away from your social group who believes that climate change isn’t real, you may encounter information that changes your mind on this topic. When you come back, you will essentially threaten one of the cultural foundations of the social circle and become the heretic.

The fear of differences drives us to divide into safe spaces, echo-chambers, and segregation.

Dysbeliefs

Most of the time someone holds some opinion X, it means that they believe other opinions that contradict opinion X are incorrect. That means that holding opinion X is a threat to any opinion that it contradicts. It means that other people’s contradicting opinions are labeled inferior on some level, otherwise you would have chosen the opinion that you think is superior.

These relatively “inferior” beliefs are what we will call dysbeliefs. This term is relative and doesn’t reflect truths or nontruths. Dysbeliefs are: ideas that one holds that threaten the other group by contradicting their beliefs, threatening or challenging ideas. In some sense, essentially all beliefs are dysbeliefs relative to other beliefs. Consider that, whatever “true reality” is, if we are to form an accurate belief about external reality (if possible), it would be a dysbelief inherently because humans do not have accurate models of external reality.

When one leaves the tribe, they are more likely to encounter and adopt dysbeliefs that contradict the tribe’s consensus belief system and therefore become a threat to the tribe if they return. Isolation breeds the adoption of dysbeliefs because belief conformity is regulated by group exposure, by the pressure of the group’s acceptance or rejection. Owning dysbeliefs leads to isolation and isolation leads to increased rate of dysbelief adoption. There is a dysbelief-isolation loop in this sense.

This effect compounds with time as well. The more time you spend away from the group, the more you’ve drifted away from the “idea economy” that the group has. So the more isolated you are, the more strange your ideas or beliefs can become.

This Is Schizophrenia

This is essentially how I think schizophrenia develops. A person drifts away from normal social bubbles and then if they develop stubborn uncommon beliefs it becomes harder for them to enter back into the normal social circle. The longer they spend in isolation, the more ingrained the uncommon belief can become, the harder it is for the person to simply abandon it. To abandon their idea would be like asking a person to stop following their religion or change their diet overnight or even to drop all of their friends and pickup new strangers as a social circle suddenly. It isn’t that easy. There is an attachment and a lot learning that goes behind the development of people’s belief systems.

As an example, imagine someone leaves to live in North Korea to live for 20 years and they develop a way of life like the locals. This person may return to America and feel very out of place, even alien. If the beliefs that they developed are ones they know others dislike, it can be an even worse problem. This generates paranoia because the threat of ostracization or bullying becomes worse. There has been research that shows political party and social class differences sparks paranoia between individuals (1).

The schizophrenic may temporarily live in the cyber nation of FlatEarth.Org and adopt a dysbelief in flat earth theory while they are absent from their peer culture in high school. This dysbelief is often met with emotional violence, dehumanization, mockery, laughter and general bullying. People who own such a dysbelief are considered crazy, stupid, laughable, and shameful. This begins the fear loop again, in which the person is less motivated to enter the anti-flat earth community (basically everyone) and finds themselves increasingly ingrained in the countercultural ideas.

This is why a lot of people get into the “alt right”. The individual may start off as a social reject in middle school, an incel or some kind of freak. Then, most of the time, the person is met with open arms by the communities of freaks and outsiders. The person adopts the cultural beliefs that propagate the social group and they are left with an attachment to stigmatized dysbeliefs. Then the newborn alt-right member hides from the rest of the world because of the stigma.

Social isolation has been associated to schizophrenic symptoms before. People become more paranoid the less friends they have and the paranoia decreases when social contact is introduced (2). Number of friends was negatively correlated to symptom severity (3). Socializing early in the schizophrenic diagnoses is thought to be crucial to recovery (4). Internet forums have been suggested to help with schizophrenia because of social interaction (5). One survey found that schizophrenics frequently reported having no friends at all, and when asked about this the subjects often reported that they didn’t think this was an issue (6). Loneliness is even genetically associated with schizophrenia (7). Lastly, and most importantly, solitary confinement produces nearly all symptoms of schizophrenia (8, 9, 10). Owning a diverse library of dysbeliefs will often further enhance isolation problems, which may result in schizophrenic tendencies. Too many dysbeliefs may land you in cultural solitary confinement. This is essentially the social defeat hypothesis of schizophrenia (updated to my own liking) (18).

We often view the artists as outcasts and historically, we have a term: the tortured artist, which is due to the meme of the schizophrenic/bipolar artist. Many artists may work endlessly to communicate their outsider or alien perspective through their art.

If you are curious about how other symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, manifest from this, check out Dynorphin Theory which makes a strong case for the biological and social factors contributing to schizophrenia using research from hundreds of studies. In short, isolation and stress (including physical stress such as illness) are linked to mechanisms associated to hallucinations, specifically the same system that the dysdelic hallucinogen Salvia Divinorum binds to in the brain.

The End of Society

Now society is splitting into fragments and chaos because of the internet. The internet has facilitated the development of dysbeliefs, it has helped people isolate away from their in-real-life contacts, it has aided in the atomization of geographically-bound cultural bubbles, and it has birthed new cultural bubbles. The internet is kind of like taking everyone from all the different countries and just dumping them all together in one neighborhood to discuss their political beliefs. This unsurprisingly leads to conflicts and chaos. The collision of our beliefs and the division this sows through social threat and fear loops is atomizing society and isolating many of us. Some are forming cults through the internet in order to correct these problems, which may reduce symptoms like hallucinations or paranoia. Instead of Columbine, we are seeing ‘school-shooter types’ band together in the masses, perhaps reducing the severity of individual suffering (less individual madness) but enhancing the massive influence on society.

We often talk about echo-chambers as if they are new forces in our lives due to the internet but in reality, echo-chambers have always existed. They were just protected by geographic and sociological boundaries. Country borders, languages, and lifestyle loops have kept people segregated and naïve to the diversity of memes that exist all around us. Now the internet has thrown all of us out of these boundaries and into comment sections where the diversity and corresponding xenophobia has become apparent.

The radical intellectual freedom that the internet provides is facilitating the development of dysbeliefs. This freedom is also allowing us to divide into further echo-chambers

The Left and The Right

Many of those who become alt-right may start off as socially rejected, driven to spend their time in the virtual space as an escape and then funneled into an ideology where one can be accepted. It is essentially a cult, but one that has become widespread enough to influence mainstream politics. 4chan is classically a place for the most socially defeated of thinkers and a supposed birthplace of the alt-right. Consider incels, people who have been associated to the alt-right and they are a kind of ‘sexually-rejected’. Many of them seem to lack friends as well, not just mates.

Everyone in America is growing increasingly threatened by the diversity of antagonistic opinions, especially those organized into the political left and right. Many have been worrying that we are at the face of a new cultural war, a new civil war in the United States. Both the left and the right seem to view the opposition as insane, perhaps as psychotic. This dual pattern is even observed with classic paranoid schizophrenia, where the individual will call normal people ‘sheeple‘ and the normal people will call the conspiracy theorists gullible and dumb, which is essentially what sheeple means. Everyone believes they are Woke or Redpilled. This pattern of reciprocity permeates throughout human social behavior, it seems to be a critical essence.

Conspiracy theories have taken the United States by storm now. Distrust in the media is climaxing and now cultural deviation, radical ideologies, and alternative belief systems are escalating in popularity. These alternative perspectives are very much like schizophrenia, except now everyone is becoming everyone else’s schizophrenic. The mainstream perspectives that are spread through the media are dissolving away and now there is no centralized belief system guiding the people of the United States. Schizophrenia used to be an outlier who didn’t adopt the common mainstream beliefs but it is now very common for people to deviate from the mainstream. And, to reiterate, the way these beliefs are forming cults may prevent the typical schizophrenic manifestations such as hallucinations, which may be a product of isolation, stress and unhealthy living.

The internet has also unveiled the unfairness of society. We see what the rich and the poor are doing. The internet inevitably provokes Marxist values like fairness by popping our cultural bubbles so that we are all aware of each other. This may be why the left has radicalized. Most of the unfairness was behind closed doors in the pre-internet era. This protected all of us, the rich from feeling guilty, the poor from feeling as betrayed as they do now. That isn’t to say awareness was nonexistent before, it’s just that now we have an endless portal into the lives of wealthier people living unfair lives that streams to our pocket devices.

The pandemic lockdowns have even worsened the madness of society by isolating us further. Even before the pandemic, a poll showed that 22% of millennials had ‘no friends’. It is no wonder that society seems to be burning down. Many individuals also already lived in conditions that resemble the lockdowns before the pandemic hit, simply because they lacked friends or the privilege to socialize. These people likely resent those who are suddenly torn apart by the lockdowns because they have been trapped living in that hell due to whatever circumstances led up to their isolation. This mixture on top of the economic crisis may have primed the protests and riots.

Solutions

The way to fix these fear loops that the alt-right and the toxic left are in is to actually allow openness and make the environment non-threatening. In some sense, we might wonder if the way the left is attacking the alt right is actually promoting the problem through threat responses. This behavior could be morally equivalent or similar to being alt-right. Assuming that alt-right is very bad, one may be promoting it’s power by stigmatizing it and allowing it to fester into the cesspool it is.

We must let our guards down.

The difficult and real solution to this is to experimentally interact with people despite being afraid that it will hurt or that people might hurt you and to maintain open mindedness about other people. One must consciously negate their threat-induced biases and expectations in order to grow out of the fear loop. If you are around people who are not harmful or scary, then you grow comfortable and eventually socializing becomes rewarding once both people have let their guards down. Reducing other people’s social threat is extremely important if we wish to have productive conversations and political discourse.

Social behavior is reciprocal.

Refrain from retaliating against offensive people. Pay attention to word choices. Avoid even slight passive aggressiveness. Do not fuel the feedback loops that maintain the accelerating destruction of our society. This is your responsibility too. Speak peacefully, clearly, and calmly. The other side will reciprocate if you are able to develop trust.

Both prosocial and antisocial behaviors are reciprocal. Consider that we are mean to ‘evil’ people. We throw them in jail and try to punish them, in ways that are arguable torture. People are like mirrors and will mimic your tone. The main problem is that you will also mimic other people’s tone and other strangers may be primed to act defensive and antagonistic. They may initiate the aggression and you will feel the urge to treat them with reciprocal aggression. You should not do this. It is irrational to reciprocate, even if you feel it is justified. The idea of justification is pointless in solving this problem.

Read The Arbiter of Truth to better understand how these reciprocal problems can manifest in very subtle and unnoticed ways. They may even draw out popularity because the strategies are so incredibly effective at captivating people.

Maintain both openness and critical thought at all times. These two don’t have to contradict each other. Be critical when new information contradicts what you believe, but be open to the possibility that that the opposition has a point. Try to see that point and acknowledge it. This helps people let their own guard down. Do not empathize with the opposition for the purposes of manipulation though, this is readily detectable by people.

Woke and Redpill are both very narcissistic terms that seem to imply enlightenment. That doesn’t mean everyone who uses the terms is invoking such a narcissism, but it is interesting to consider that such grandiose terms are used on opposite sides of the political spectrum. It is another reciprocal pattern, a duality. Everyone is wrong about the way they view the world in some ways, often times very many ways. We are not enlightened and this isn’t news (for most of us)! So it is important that we stop behaving as if we are. We must all accept that we might be wrong about even the most absurd things, such as the earth being round, if we wish to facilitate the very dialogue that allows for better ideas to evolve. The transfer of ideas is important for cultural evolution and now we need it more than ever, or else people will die in an actual war.

Madness is relative; your enemy isn’t necessarily crazy for disagreeing with you. Though, some ideas may be better than others and we ought to find out which ideas those are, in a peaceful way.

Here is some literature related to this topic you might find useful:

Social rejection is found to impair cognition and decision-making.

Social rejection can cause one to become aggressive, even towards groups.

Social exclusion leads to unintentional self-defeating behavior.

Almost 40 Chinese warplanes breach Taiwan Strait median line; Taiwan President calls it a 'threat of force',https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/21/asia/taiwan-china-warplanes-median-line-intl-hnk-scli/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Taiwan's President has accused Beijing of purposefully inflaming tensions in East Asia, after Chinese warplanes crossed the sensitive median line across the narrow strait that separates the mainland and the self-governing island almost 40 times on Friday and Saturday.

Taken together, the repeated incursions, which came from multiple directions and involved a combination of sophisticated fighter jets and heavy bombers, is without modern precedent and marks a significant escalation in cross-strait tensions.

""What we are seeing now is not just a situation across the Taiwan Strait, but a regional situation. China's recent military activities, especially in the past few days, clearly constitute a threat of force, which is part of their verbal attacks and military threats (against Taiwan),"" President Tsai Ing-wen told reporters Sunday.

The uptick in Chinese military activity came as Keith Krach , the United States under secretary of state for economic, energy and environmental affairs, held meetings in the island's capital Taipei, ahead of a memorial service on Saturday for former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui.

The three-day visit to the island was denounced by Beijing, with a spokesman for the country's Foreign Ministry demanding the two sides ""immediately stop"" official exchanges.

China has reacted with increasing anger at warming ties between Taipei and Washington , and has ramped up military drills in the waters around the island which Beijing continues to view as an inseparable part of its territory despite the two sides have been governed separately for over seven decades.

On Friday and Saturday, a total of 37 Chinese aircraft, a mixture of H-6 bombers, J-10, J-11 and J-16 fighters, and an Y-8 antisubmarine warfare plane crossed the median line, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry press releases.

The ministry said in a statement that it ""issued radio warnings, scrambled fighters and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor the activities."" In her remarks, Tsai said that such actions would make other countries in the region ""more aware of the threat posed by China.""

On Monday, Beijing said its forces are operating legally. ""Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and there is no so-called median line,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.

'A threat of force'

The US has maintained close ties with Taiwan since the island split from mainland China in 1949 after the end of a bloody civil war. But since Washington and Beijing established formal diplomatic ties in 1979, the US had largely refrained from sending high-level officials to Taipei so as to not antagonize the Chinese government.

China's leader, President Xi Jinping, has been clear in his ambitions to ""reunify"" the island with the mainland, and has refused to rule out the use of force, even though the ruling Chinese Communist Party has never exerted direct control over Taiwan.

The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) said in a statement on Friday said that the recent exercises were made necessary owing to the ""current situation across the Taiwan Strait.""

A spokesman added that Chinese troops had the ""confidence and determination to thwart any attempt by any person or force to carry out 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities in any form.""

A detailed report on the aerial drills in the Global Times, a state-run nationalist tabloid based in Beijing, accused the US of ""playing the Taiwan card"" and escalating ""provocations on military and diplomacy.""

The report, citing Chinese mainland military analysts pointed out that the warplane combination the PLA deployed was similar to a real combat situation and covered a variety of different scenarios.

The ""PLA drills this time are not a warning, but a rehearsal for a Taiwan takeover,"" said the report, citing analysts.

In apparent response to Beijing's repeated threats, Washington has increased cooperation with Taipei , approving new arms sales, including for F-16 fighter jets and M1A1 main battle tanks, as well as sending Azar, a cabinet secretary, to visit last month, making him the highest-ranking US official to visit the island in decades.

Just last week, a congressional aide told CNN that the US is preparing to sell seven packages of weapons systems to Taiwan, including MQ-9B Reaper drones.

The US military has been making its presence known too, sending warships through the Taiwan Strait with increasing frequency.

In a statement Friday, the Pentagon said it was Beijing that was ramping up tensions in the region.

""The PLA's aggressive and destabilizing reactions reflect a continued attempt to alter the status quo and rewrite history. This is another example of the PRC (People's Republic of China) increasingly using its military as a tool of coercion with Taiwan and other neighbors,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Supple.

As PLA forces conducted drills near Taiwan, US forces engaged in a series of live-fire exercises off Guam, 1,700 miles (2,750 kilometers) to the southeast.

On Saturday, US warships, submarines and warplanes involved in the Valiant Shield 2020 exercises participated in live fire missile drills, during which a retired US Navy frigate was sunk.

""This exercise demonstrates our ability to bring overwhelming firepower from the sea whether that comes from under the surface, on the surface, or from the air,"" US Navy Capt. Steven DeMoss, commodore of Destroyer Squadron 15, said in a statement. ""We have this capability in every theater across the globe and can employ these weapons at the place and time of our choosing.""

On Sunday, the guided missile cruiser USS Antietam simulated an attack on island targets with a Tomahawk cruise missile. ""This exercise demonstrates the Antietam's ability to track, target, and engage threats to protect peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific,"" a US Navy statement said."
"'A third of Bangladesh underwater' after heavy rains, floods",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/bangladesh-underwater-heavy-rains-floods-200714133251746.html,"At least 1.5 million people are affected, as rivers threaten to burst their banks, officials say.

A third of Bangladesh is underwater after some of the heaviest rains in a decade, officials said.

Almost four million people have also been hit by monsoon floods in South Asia.

The monsoon – which usually falls from June to September – is crucial to the economy of the Indian sub-continent, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region every year.

“This is going to be the worst flood in a decade,” Bangladesh’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre chief Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan told the AFP news agency.

The floods started late last month, and after briefly easing continued to worsen, destroying crops and driving people from their homes in several impoverished regions.

Bangladesh is crisscrossed by 230 rivers, including 53 shared with India.

The heavy rains have swollen two main Himalayan river systems – the Brahmaputra and the Ganges – that flow through India and Bangladesh.

Bhuiyan said about a third of flood-prone Bangladesh – a delta-nation crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers – was underwater, and at least 1.5 million people were affected, with village homes and roads flooded.

“The floodwater is constantly rising. Neither we nor our cattle can go out. So, I’m using a boat to go out. We’re having issues regarding food also. The cooking ovens have been flooded. Even our beds are also underwater,” Samsud Doha, farmer, said.

In north-central Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra river was almost 40cm (15.7 inches) higher than normal and threatening to burst its banks, district administrator Farook Ahmed told AFP.

Most villagers were trying to stay near their flood-damaged homes, but some 15,000 had fled severely affected areas, officials said.

Another farmer, Rabiul Islam, said: “Our homesteads have been flooded. We had a little road left which got destroyed last night. So, we’re taking away all our crops like rice and corn and other goods.”

With a 10-day forecast pointing to rising waters, Bhuiyan said if more rivers burst their banks, some 40 percent of the nation could be flooded “in a worst-case scenario”.

In Assam, northeast India, more than 2.1 million people have been affected since mid-May.

At least 50 people have died so far – 12 in the past week as floodwaters surged – with tens of thousands of mostly rural residents evacuated to relief camps, officials said.

“We have two challenges here: one is COVID-19 and another is flood,” the head of a local rescue team, Abhijeet Kumar Verma, told AFP.

In Nepal, at least 50 people have died in landslides and floods triggered by the monsoon rains, with homes swept away and roads and bridges damaged."
Companies are talking about turning 'furloughs' into permanent layoffs,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/companies-are-talking-about-turning-furloughs-into-permanent-layoffs.html,"A worker wearing a protective mask adjusts a torque wrench inside the service area at a Harley-Davidson dealership in Oakland, California, on Thursday, July 16, 2020.

The dark side of good earnings: Companies are talking about turning ""furloughs"" into permanent layoffs. You knew this was coming. It's been a very strange earnings season. Analysts dramatically underestimated earnings for a good part of the market, particularly industrials, financials, and many technology stocks. The average company beat analyst estimates by 22% — way above the historic norm of a 3% beat. But top-line revenue beat by only 1%. The huge disparity between topline and bottom-line can be explained simply. Companies have gone on a dramatic cost-cutting initiative, far in excess of analyst expectations, that have significantly boosted bottom-line returns. The good news is if and when the economy recovers and revenue growth returns, corporate profits will be even stronger. The bad news is a lot of people are going to get laid off.

Travel reductions and lower rent

Cost cutting is taking many forms, but two of the most obvious have been reductions in travel and lower rent, both of which are becoming permanent. S&P Global's CFO, in the recent conference call, spoke of a ""permanent element to our travel reduction."" The CEO of Fortive, an industrial company, echoed the same sentiment, noting they are attempting to permanently reduce travel expenses because ""We just don't need to necessarily make the trips that we've historically made."" Harmit Singh, the executive VP & CFO of jeans maker Levi Strauss, is also expecting big savings from lower rents: ""[W]e are looking at structuring our rentals or our leases that we currently have more favorably over the next few years.""

Furloughs started temporary but becoming permanent

The most glaring example of cost cutting is the temporary job ""furloughs"" in many cases morphing into permanent layoffs. The CEO of C.H. Robinson, a transportation company, said about half of their furloughs are now permanent headcount reductions. William Christopher Wellborn, the COO of Mohawk Industries, said ""We have made permanent staffing reductions to reduce our fixed cost and align with current demand."" The CFO of Textron, another industrial, and the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, both said temporary salaried layoffs have converted into permanent reductions. Spirit AeroSystems' CEO said they were making the layoffs of thousands permanent after the Boeing/Airbus cuts.

Disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street

Unfortunately, these permanent cost cutting initiatives are only going to widen the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street — the belief that the stock market is either disconnected from reality or that it is a quiet cheerleader for layoffs because it will boost the corporate bottom line. ""We saw companies being very explicit about layoffs and other cost reductions becoming permanent during the latest earnings season,"" said Nick Mazing, Head of Research at Sentieo. ""These cost decisions will have negative effects on employment downstream, too: lower business travel means less demand for hotels, dining, flights, and so on.""

The rally is not a mystery"
"""You have 12 or 13 models showing sensitivity which is no longer 3C, but rather 5C or 6C with a doubling of CO2"" -Director of the Potsdam Institute for climate research",https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1513326/climate-models-suggest-paris-goals-reach,"Vastly more data and computing power has become available since the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections were finalised in 2013.

Vastly more data and computing power has become available since the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections were finalised in 2013.

New climate models show carbon dioxide is a more potent greenhouse gas than previously understood, a finding that could push the Paris treaty goals for capping global warming out of reach, scientists have told AFP.

Developed in parallel by separate teams in half-a-dozen countries, the models -- which will underpin revised UN temperature projections next year -- suggest scientists have for decades consistently underestimated the warming potential of CO2.

Vastly more data and computing power has become available since the current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections were finalised in 2013.

""We have better models now,"" Olivier Boucher, head of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Modelling Centre in Paris, told AFP, adding that they ""represent current climate trends more accurately"".

The most influential projections from government-backed teams in the US, Britain, France, and Canada point to a future in which CO2 concentrations that have long been equated with a 3C world would more likely heat the planet's surface by four or five degrees.

""If you think the new models give a more realistic picture, then it will, of course, be harder to achieve the Paris targets, whether it is 1.5 or two degrees Celsius,"" scientist Mark Zelinka told AFP.

Zelinka, from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, is the lead author of the first peer-reviewed assessment of the new generation of models, published earlier this month in Geophysical Research Letters.

'Holy grail' for scientists

For more than a century, scientists have puzzled over a deceptively simple question: if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere doubles, how much will Earth's surface warm over time?

The resulting temperature increase is known as Earth's ""climate sensitivity"".

That number has been hard to pin down due to a host of elusive variables. Whether oceans and forests, for example, will continue to absorb more than half of the CO2 emitted by humanity is hard to predict.

But the biggest wild card has always been clouds.

""How clouds evolve in a warmer climate and whether they will exert a tempering or amplifying effect has long been a major source of uncertainty,"" explained Imperial College London researcher Joeri Rogelj, the lead IPCC author on the global carbon budget -- the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted without exceeding a given temperature cap.

The new models reflect a better understanding of cloud dynamics in at least two ways that reinforce the warming impact of CO2.

Zelinka said new research had confirmed high clouds in the bottom layer of Earth's atmosphere boost the Sun's radiation -- and global heating accentuates that dynamic.

""Another big uncertainty has been how low clouds will change, such as stratocumulus decks of the west coast of continents,"" he said.

""That has been the holy grail of climate modellers for a long time.""

Recent observations suggest this type of cloud cover decreases with warming, which means less of the Sun's energy gets bounced back into space by white surfaces.

For most of the last 10,000 years -- during which time humanity's numbers swelled from a few million to 7.6 billion -- the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was a nearly constant 280 parts per million (ppm).

But at the start of the 19th century as the industrial revolution kicked into high gear, fuelled by oil, gas and especially coal, the number of CO2 molecules in the air shot up.

Shifting perceptions

Today the concentration stands at 412 ppm, a 45 percent rise -- half of it in the last three decades.

Last year alone, human activity injected more than 41 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, some five million tonnes per hour.

With one degree Celsius of warming so far, the world is coping with increasingly deadly heatwaves, droughts, floods and tropical cyclones made more destructive by rising seas.

In the 1890s, Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius calculated that doubling CO2 would eventually lift Earth's average surface temperature five or six degrees Celsius, though he later revised the figure to 4C.

Remarkably, he recognised that burning fossil fuels could one day drive such a change.

By the late 1970s, scientists settled on a climate sensitivity of 3C (plus-or-minus 1.5C), corresponding to about 560 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere.

That assessment remained largely unchanged -- until now.

The IPCC, the UN's climate advisory body, posits four scenarios for future warming, depending on how aggressively humanity works to reduce greenhouse gases.

The most ambitious -- in line with the Paris goal of capping temperature rise to ""well below"" 2C -- would require slashing CO2 emissions by more than 10 percent per year, starting now.

At the other extreme, a so-called ""business-as-usual"" trajectory of increased fossil fuel use would leave large swathes of the planet uninhabitable by century's end.

The first scenario has become wishful thinking, according to many scientists, while the worst-case is unlikely unless Earth itself begins releasing natural stores of greenhouse gases from, say, melting permafrost.

That leaves two middle-of-the-road scenarios -- known as RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 -- that more likely reflect our climate future.

According to the IPCC, the first would correspond to 538 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere, while a RCP6.0 pathway would see an increase in CO2 concentration to 670 ppm.

'Heated debate'

A doubling of 1850's CO2 levels to about 570 ppm falls between the two and thus takes on a real-world importance that probably would have startled Arrhenius, the late 19th-century Swedish chemist.

""Right now, there is an enormously heated debate within the climate modelling community,"" said Earth system scientist Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

""You have 12 or 13 models showing sensitivity which is no longer 3C, but rather 5C or 6C with a doubling of CO2,"" he told AFP. ""What is particularly worrying is that these are not the outliers.""

Models from France, the US Department of Energy, Britain's Met Office and Canada show climate sensitivity of 4.9C, 5.3C, 5.5C and 5.6C respectively, Zelinka said.

""You have to take these models seriously -- they are highly developed, state-of-the-art.""

Among the 27 new models examined in Zelinka's study, these were also among the ones that best-matched climate change over the last 75 years, further validation of their accuracy.

That said, other models that will feed into the IPCC's next major Assessment Report found significantly smaller increases, though almost all came in higher than prior estimates.

Scientists are also still poring over the results to look for methodological glitches or inconsistencies.

""The jury is still out, but it is worrying,"" said Rockstrom.

""Climate sensitivity has been in the range of 1.5C to 4.5C for more than 30 years. If it is now moving to between 3C and 7C, that would be tremendously dangerous."""
Historical Discovery Shows The Coal Industry Was Well Aware of Climate Change Over 50 Years Ago,https://www.sciencealert.com/coal-industry-knew-about-climate-change-in-the-60s-damning-revelations-show?perpetual=yes&limitstart=1,"A rediscovered journal from the 1960s reveals the coal industry has understood the dangers of human-caused climate change for over 50 years, and may constitute the earliest known evidence of such fateful insider knowledge.

It's become clear in recent years how oil giant Exxon was aware of the causes and consequences of climate change from at least the 1970s, but chose to deliberately mislead the public for decades. The newly resurfaced evidence now shows coal executives equally understood the science of catastrophic global warming as far back as 1966.

In a research article in the August 1966 issue of trade publication Mining Congress Journal, James Garvey, the then-president of Bituminous Coal Research Inc., which developed pollution control equipment, discussed the state of pollutants and their regulation in the coal industry at the time.

While much of the paper is concerned with sulphur in coal, a small section early in the article is concerned with carbon dioxide (CO2) discharge, and lays bare just how acutely appreciated the ""the far-reach­ing aspects of the air pollution problem"" actually were as far back as the 1960s.

""There is evidence that the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is increasing rapidly as a result of the combustion of fossil fuels,"" Garvey writes.

""If the future rate of increase continues as it is at the present, it has been predicted that, because the CO2 envelope reduces radiation, the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere will increase and that vast changes in the climates of the Earth will result.""

Garvey ends the paragraph, noting: ""Such changes in temperature will cause melting of the polar icecaps, which, in turn would result in the inundation of many coastal cities including New York and London"".

The existence of the article was discovered in August by engineer Chris Cherry from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who found it in a stack of vintage journals about to be discarded.

As he told Élan Young at HuffPost, Cherry was floored by Garvey's observations, and what they implied about the scope of historic scientific awareness of climate change even in the 1960s – years before denialism of human-caused climate change became entrenched.

""It pretty well described a version of what we know today as climate change,"" Cherry told HuffPost.

""Increases in average air temperatures, melting of polar ice caps, rising of sea levels. It's all in there.""

It's worth noting that Garvey's article isn't the sole voice acknowledging the dangers of coal-produced pollution in the August 1966 issue.

In a discussion piece following Garvey's paper, combustion engineer James Jones from Peabody Coal (now called Peabody Energy, the largest private coal company in the world), does not address the global warming issue, but admits that air pollution standards to protect health have a place, saying the ""Situation is Urgent"".

""We are in favour of cleaning up our air,"" Jones writes. ""We are, in effect, 'buying time'. But we must use that time productively to find answers to the many unsolved problems.""

In the years and decades to come, Peabody would become a huge industrial player in organised climate change denial – buying perhaps much more time than Jones had ever envisaged.

Of course, while the rediscovery of the 1966 journal is important – given it reveals the coal industry understood the climate change implications of burning fossil fuels, even so long ago – the truth is, by that point, those dangers were no secret.

The year before, in 1965, a US science advisory committee advised president Lyndon Johnson of the global warming processes underway due to fossil fuels being burned.

""Man is unwittingly conducting a vast geophysical experiment. Within a few generations he is burning the fossil fuels that slowly accumulated in the earth over the past 500 million years,"" the report said.

""The climatic changes that may be produced by the increased CO2 content could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings.""

Even then this was old news. The dangers of climate change literally made the front pages of newspapers as far back as 1912 – more than 100 years ago – and was written about even in the popular press as far back as the mid-19th century.

While our scientific understanding of many of the processes involved in climate change has no doubt evolved hugely over the last 150 years or so, it's clearly been known for an incredibly long time that burning coal produces CO2 that traps heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet. Case closed.

Given the unfortunate, public realities of pollution from burning coal, in the conclusion of his discussion piece, the Peabody engineer Jones wondered: ""What can an individual with a personal stake in the future of the coal industry do?""

Among the answers, he offered this.

""Be a 'one-man' public relations emissary for the coal industry,"" Jones explained to his industry colleagues.

""Tell your neighbours, friends, and the general public how important coal is to their every-day existence. Also tell them about the all-out cooperative efforts of the coal industry to reduce air pollution.""

Sound and timeless advice, you might say. At least, for somebody with a personal stake in the future of the coal industry.

A few climate models are now predicting an unprecedented and alarming spike in temperatures — perhaps as much as 5 degrees Celsius,https://www.businessinsider.com/global-warming-climate-models-higher-than-usual-confusing-scientists-2020-2,"A handful of climate projections are predicting much higher rise in global temperatures than scientists have seen in the models before.

While there's concern over the number, some scientists hope the latest projections are outliers.

A 2-degree rise in temperature could lead sea level to jump, coral reefs to die, and water to become dangerously scarce in some parts of the world. Some models right now predict a 5-degree rise.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Several recent climate models have suggested the Earth's climate could warm to a far higher temperature than scientists previously predicted, according to a report from Bloomberg.

The startling anomaly first appeared in models from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), which suggested that if Earth's atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentration doubles (as it's expected to do by the end of the century), the planet could wind up 5.3 degrees hotter. That's 33% higher than the group's previous estimate.

About a fifth of new climate-model results published in the past year have indicated similarly stark global temperature spikes, according to Bloomberg. The UK-based Met Office Hadley Center predicted a 5.5 degrees of warming, the US Department of Energy calculated a 5.3°-degree jump, French scientists estimated a 4.9-degree increase, and a model from Canadian scientists predicted the largest rise: 5.6 degrees

Scientists hope the models are an ""overshot,"" Bloomberg reported. It will take scientists a significant amount time – at least months – to figure out how to interpret the results.

The climate models estimate ""climate sensitivity,"" which tells scientists how much warmer the planet will get as a result of rising CO₂ concentrations. For four decades, the expected temperature rise if CO2 levels double has been about 3 degrees.

These models have a proven track record of accurately forecasting climate change. A recent study from the American Geophysical Union found that climate projections over the past five decades have largely been accurate — actual climate observations aligned with the models' predictions.

Still, there's a hope among climate scientists that the new projections are outliers. About a dozen other models are still due to be released, Bloomberg reported, and they could help paint a clearer picture.

""We hope it's not the right answer,"" Klaus Wyser, a senior researcher at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute told Bloomberg.

In the 2015 Paris climate agreement — from which President Donald Trump has started to withdraw the US —countries pledged to reduce carbon emissions in order to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees. It also established a more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, but that's likely now out of reach given that the planet has already warmed by about 1 degree.

If global temperatures rise by 2 degrees, models predict, sea levels would get 1.6 feet higher, global heatwaves would become far more common, and subtropical areas could lose a third of their supply of fresh water. Nearly all aquatic life in oceans worldwide would be impacted; 99% of coral reefs could die."

ABC News spent more time on royal baby in one week than on climate crisis in one year,https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2019/05/21/ABC-News-spent-more-time-on-royal-baby-in-one-week-than-on-climate-crisis-in-one-year/223759,"A version of this post was originally published by Grist.

Here's media misconduct in a nutshell: ABC’s World News Tonight spent more than seven minutes reporting on the birth of royal baby Archie in the week after he was born -- more time than the program spent covering climate change during the entire year of 2018.

Other major TV news outlets in the U.S. have also severely under-reported on climate change and yet found plenty of time to note the arrival of Archie, son of Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. Archie is now seventh in line to the British throne, which means he'll be a permanent tabloid fixture but is unlikely to ever be a king.

On May 6, the day Archie was born, the United Nations released a summary of a major new report warning that human destruction of the natural world, including through climate change, now threatens up to a million species with extinction. That's dire news for our species too, as it also threatens our water supplies, food security, and health. The destruction of ecosystems and species “means grave impacts on people around the world are now likely,” the report warned. Robert Watson, head of the group of scientists that produced the report, laid it on the line: “What’s at stake here is a liveable world.”

Yes, this extinction crisis is grim news, and many people like a little light fare mixed in with their headlines -- a report on a royal baby, if you’re into that kind of thing, or a sports recap, or a segment on disgruntled Game of Thrones fans. But when the light fare takes over and the real news is shut out, that’s beyond lopsided. We’ve got a problem.

Media Matters tracked broadcast news coverage on May 6 and found that ABC and NBC's nightly news programs failed to even mention the U.N. biodiversity report. They did, however, air two segments each on Archie. CBS was the only national broadcast network that ran a segment on the biodiversity report that night, and of course it ran one on the baby, too.

The perverse priorities of TV newscasters became even more obvious in the following days. Archie stayed in the news. Biodiversity and climate change stayed out of it.

By May 12, the three national broadcast networks' nightly news shows had spent a total of 17 minutes and 56 seconds on baby Archie. The extinction report and climate change garnered a total of one minute and 21 seconds -- all of it in that single CBS segment on May 6.

ABC's World News Tonight devoted the most time to the royal baby: seven minutes and 14 seconds over the week. Compare that to the six minutes and three seconds the program spent on climate change during the entirety of 2018. ABC typically lags behind its competitors in time spent covering climate change, as Media Matters has previously documented. ABC has devoted less airtime to the climate crisis than CBS and NBC every year since 2013 -- even though CBS and NBC don't have great track records themselves. Lest you think the old broadcast dinosaurs don’t matter anymore, their flagship nightly news programs are still attracting an average of 25 million viewers a night, including more than 5 million between the ages of 25 and 52.

Within hours of Archie's birth, Vice's Derek Mead published a post headlined “Who’s Going to Tell the Royal Baby That Our Planet Is Unequivocally Dying?” It concluded, “Royal baby aside, the most important news of the day, the decade, our lives, is this: We have pushed the planet far past its limits, and we ignore that at our existential peril.”

Mead joins a small but growing group of journalists and citizens demanding that our media step it up and cover climate change like the looming existential crisis it is. As Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope wrote last month for the Columbia Journalism Review, “If American journalism doesn’t get the climate story right—and soon—no other story will matter.” The Columbia Journalism Review, The Nation, and The Guardian are launching a Covering Climate Now project to spur the media into action. The disproportionate hullabaloo over the royal baby, juxtaposed with the near silence over the extinction crisis, shows exactly why we need it.

Imagine if mainstream media covered climate change with anything near the fervor of a royal wedding or a royal birth. Weeks of high-pitched pieces anticipating the release of new climate action plans. Minute-by-minute coverage dissecting every aspect of new scientific reports. Splashy, in-depth profiles of the people leading new climate movements. Homepages and front pages dominated by the climate crisis and climate solutions, day after day. If we can imagine it, can we make it happen?

Methodology

Media Matters analyzed coverage from May 6 to May 12 on the major broadcast networks' nightly news programs: ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, and NBC Nightly News. We identified segments mentioning the U.N. biodiversity assessment by searching iQ media and Nexis for the terms (nature OR biodiversity OR extinction OR extinct OR climate OR species OR planet) AND (report OR study). We identified segments mentioning climate change by searching for the terms (climate change OR global warming). We identified segments mentioning the royal baby by searching for the terms (baby OR Archie).

Millennials Didn’t Kill the Economy. The Economy Killed Millennials.,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/stop-blaming-millennials-killing-economy/577408/,"Millennials aren’t doing in the economy. It’s the economy that’s doing in Millennials.

My history with the accused goes back several years.

In 2012, I published a column in The Atlantic with Jordan Weissmann, now a writer at Slate, called “The Cheapest Generation.” That headline—which got us in trouble because it was the only thing most people read—was a bit of a misdirection. The deeper question of the piece was whether the Great Recession might permanently reduce young people’s taste for houses and cars—two of the most vital engines of the economy.

For years, various outlets, including The Washington Post and the Pew Research Center, continued reporting that young people were buying fewer cars and houses than those in previous generations at a similar point in their life. In 2016, about 34 percent of Americans under 35 owned a house; when Boomers and Gen Xers were under 35, about half of them did.

But the fact that young people are buying fewer houses and cars doesn’t prove that they want fewer houses and cars. It might mean they simply can’t afford them. That latter conclusion is now supported by research from the Federal Reserve.

Fed economists found that the depressed rate of homeownership among Millennials was entirely about income and affordability. Young Boomers and young Gen Xers made significantly more money at a similar point in their life cycle, they said, and controlling for income and employment wiped out all generational differences.

Read: How Friendsgiving took over Millennial culture

Just as important, homes in the United States are less affordable than they used to be. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the typical sale price of an existing single-family home in 2017 was 4.2 times greater than the median household income; that’s 30 percent higher than in 1988. It’s even worse in some cities. Since the late 1980s, price-to-income ratios have more than doubled in metro areas such as Miami, Denver, and Seattle. In San Francisco, the median house price doubled in just five years to more than $1.6 million. That’s a lot of foregone avocado toast.

On the car front: News reports sometimes find that the average age of new-car buyers is quickly rising, which makes it sound like young people are ditching their ride. But as the Fed economist Christopher Kurz has shown in several studies, that factoid is somewhat misleading. Young people actually buy the same number of cars per capita today that they did in 2005, at the height of the housing bubble. The average age of car buying is going up almost entirely because Americans older than 55 are buying more new vehicles than they were 20 years ago. In 1995, Americans over 55 bought about one-third of all new cars. Today they’re buying almost two-thirds.

It’s also true that Millennials spend less than previous generations on transportation. But everybody is spending less; total transportation spending has declined as a share of the typical household’s budget by almost 5 percent in the past 30 years, according to the Fed. Perhaps that’s because people hold on to their car for longer, or own a more efficient car that requires fewer tune-ups. Or maybe that’s a result of the declining cost of new vehicles under the North American Free Trade Agreement, which shifted some auto-manufacturing work to Mexico."

Snow and glaciers in New Zealand have turned brown after being exposed to dust from the Australian bushfires, with one expert saying the incident could increase glacier melt this season by as much as 30%.

On Wednesday many parts of the South Island woke up to an orange haze and red sun, after smoke from the Victorian and New South Wales blazes drifted east on Tuesday night, smothering many parts of the island for most of the day.

On Thursday, pictures taken from the Southern Alps showed the smoke haze carrying particles of dust had tinged snow-capped mountain peaks and glaciers a shade of caramel, with former prime minister Helen Clark expressing concern for the long-lasting environmental impacts on the mountains.

'Apocalyptic': New Zealand shrouded in smoke from Australian bushfires Read more

“Impact of ash on glaciers is likely to accelerate melting,” Clark tweeted. “How one country’s tragedy has spillover effects.”

There are more than 3,000 glaciers in New Zealand and since the 1970s scientists have recorded them shrinking by nearly a third, with current estimates predicting they will disappear entirely by the end of the century.

Professor Andrew Mackintosh is head of the school of earth, atmosphere and environment at Monash University, and the former director of the Antarctic Research Centre.

He said in nearly two decades of studying glaciers in New Zealand he had never seen such a quantity of dust transported across the Tasman, and the current event had the potential to increase this season’s glacier melt by 20-30%, although Mackintosh stressed this was no more than an estimate.

“It is quite common for dust to be transported to New Zealand glaciers, but I would say that the amount of transport right now is pretty phenomenal – I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it,” Mackintosh said.“It is concerning to me to see so much material being deposited on the glaciers.”

Mackintosh said the whiteness of snow and ice reflected the sun’s heat, and slowed melting. But when this whiteness was obscured the glacier could melt at a faster rate.

The higher glaciers around Mount Cook could likely get more snowfall soon, Mackintosh said, but the lower glaciers may not get another dump till March, and the dust would sit there until then, likely turning pink when algae began to grow.

The impacts of the dust event would likely last no longer than a year, Mackintosh said, but if Australia continued to be impacted by extreme wildfires and droughts “it will be one of the factors that is accelerating the demise of glaciers in New Zealand overall”.

The recent smoke haze drifting over New Zealand is the fourth such event this summer, the Met Service said, and despite no official health warnings being issued, many with asthma said they were choosing to remain indoors during the unusual conditions.

The Met Service said most of the smoke remaining over New Zealand would clear by Friday.

Early in December travel writer Liz Carlson took pictures of regions of the Southern Alps turning pink following exposure to smoke from Australia early in the bushfire season.

In a blog Carlson wrote: “It’s pretty remarkable to see the impact of the fires from so far away.”

“Our glaciers don’t need any more battles as they are already truly endangered; it puts the impact of climate change into even more stark reality we can’t ignore.”

"'Barbaric': 8 Million Americans Have Been Forced to Start Crowdfunding Campaigns to Cover Medical Costs, Survey Shows",https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/02/19/barbaric-8-million-americans-have-been-forced-start-crowdfunding-campaigns-cover,"An estimated eight million people in the U.S. have started a crowdfunding campaign to help pay for their own or a member of their household's healthcare costs, according to a survey released Wednesday.

The poll, which was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, also found that in addition to the millions who have launched crowdfunding efforts for themselves or a member of their household, at least 12 million more Americans have started crowdfunding efforts for someone else.

Fifty million Americans have donated to such fundraising efforts, the survey showed.

""As annual out-of-pocket costs continue to rise, more Americans are struggling to pay their medical bills, and millions are turning to their social networks and crowdfunding sites to fund medical treatments and pay medical bills,"" Mollie Hertel, senior research scientist at NORC, said in a statement. ""Although about a quarter of Americans report having sponsored or donated to a campaign, this share is likely to increase in the face of rising premiums and out-of-pocket costs.""

The survey found that 60% of Americans believe the government—not charities, family members, or friends—has a ""great deal or a lot of responsibility"" to provide ""help when medical care is unaffordable.""

""I have to presume that most crowdfunding campaigns fail,"" tweeted single-payer advocate Tim Faust.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

As climate change intensifies, natural environments are becoming major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations Global Goal 13, Climate Action, urges countries to pursue zero emissions to avoid catastrophic environmental changes. You can join us in taking action on related actions here

The Arctic is now releasing more carbon dioxide in the winter than it can absorb in the summer, according to a new report.

Now that heat waves are occurring in the winter, and the Arctic is warming three times faster than the global average because of human activity, greenhouse gases that would have normally remained frozen in the ground are being released into the atmosphere, according to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

The study indicates that more than 1.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide are being released from Arctic soil annually because of warming temperatures — but plant growth in the region can only draw around 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the soil during warmer months.

That means that an additional 600 million tons of CO2 are being released annually, which exceeds the CO2 levels of 189 countries.

Globally, countries release around 42 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, with China, the United States, India, Russia, Japan, and Germany accounting for nearly half of this total.

The United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change estimates that no more than 420 billion tons of carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere in the years ahead if goals set under the Paris climate agreement are to be achieved.

The global pact aims to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, otherwise catastrophic environmental changes could occur.

The transition of the Arctic from a carbon sink (an area that stores more carbon dioxide than it releases) to a carbon hose (an area that releases more carbon dioxide than it stores), jeopardizes this already precarious goal.

For years, scientists had suspected that an important shift was underway in the Arctic as global temperatures increased, but no data had been collected on emissions in the region.

A team of scientists from 12 countries set out to change this by placing monitoring devices in more than 100 sites in the Arctic and gathered more than 1,000 readings, according to CBC.

After extrapolating the data, they calculated annual emissions and compared them with the annual absorption level, and found a significant gap.

The scientists estimate that emissions from the region will increase by 40% by the end of the century if countries continue on a “business-as-usual” trajectory and make no major efforts to halt the use of fossil fuels. Even if meaningful climate action occurs, emissions from the Arctic will rise by an estimated 17% by the end of the century.

The Arctic is also becoming a major emitter of methane, a greenhouse gas with 30 times the heat-trapping ability as carbon dioxide.

The phenomenon taking place in the Arctic is known as a feedback loop. As the planet warms, forests, permafrost layers, glaciers, and more, are releasing more emissions and absorbing more heat, raising global temperatures in the process, and causing more environmental changes to occur — setting in motion a cycle that could soon reach a dangerous runaway point.

These feedback loops make it all the more urgent for countries to bring their net emissions to zero.

Law enforcement is absolutely compromised and attributes to how unstable things really are.

Over the weekend, an Instagram video went viral of an incident in the Santa Clarita Valley, which took place after three skateboarding kids, two of whom happened to be Black, were being physically harassed by a homeless guy brandishing a knife, causing onlookers, including the manager of the nearby Buffalo Wild Wings, to call the cops to help the kids. But when LA County Sheriff’s deputies arrived on scene, they held the two Black teenagers at gunpoint, with frightening intensity, and reportedly didn’t bother with the knife-wielding homeless man.

“This is something my son and his friends will never forget,” wrote Tammi Collins, the mother of one of the skaters held at gunpoint by the LASD deputies, who posted one of the Instagram videos of the incident. “I still wonder how will I ever help my son recover from this traumatic experience. Please pray for my family.”

On Monday afternoon, Sheriff Alex Villanueva made an announcement about the incident, also on Instagram, in which he said he had “concerns regarding the tactics employed” and that the “matter is being investigated.”

On Friday, an Op-Ed in the Washington Post, written by León Krauze, the lead anchor at KMEX, Univision’s station in Los Angeles, suggested that, the LA Sheriff’s department “should stop its posturing and answer for the killing of Andrés Guardado.”

And there is the ongoing issue of the Executioners, the most recent deputy gang that has come to the public’s attention, courtesy of the story WitnessLA broke late last month.

In the past few days, another deputy has prepared to file a civil rights lawsuit against the department due to his experiences with this tattooed deputy clique that operates out of the LASD’s Compton station.

(More on that later.)

And on Sunday, Compton’s mayor, Aja Brown, along with other community members, told ABC7’s Carlos Granda and Lisa Bartley a string of painful stories of mistreatment by Compton sheriff’s deputies, some of it quite recent, as they called for an investigation into the station’s “rogue deputy gang.” In addition, according to Sunday’s ABC7 story, Compton officials are continuing to question their contract with the LASD for policing.

About those deputy gangs

Now, a new rigorously researched report takes an in-depth look at the corrosive effects that deputy gangs inside the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department have had — and are still having — on constitutional policing across LA County.

The report is scheduled to come out in September. However, WitnessLA has obtained a draft copy of the 28-page report, titled Fifty Years of “Deputy Gangs” in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department: Identifying Root Causes and Effects to Advocate for Meaningful Reforms, which allows us to give you a preview of the conclusions the researchers have drawn.

The report is authored by the Center for Juvenile Law and Policy (CJLP), a well-respected legal clinic at Loyola Law School (founded in 2004 by public defender Cyn Yamashiro), which trains law students to “holistically represent at-risk youth in delinquency proceedings,” and to do so pro bono.

The clinic is overseen by Loyola Law Professor Sean Kennedy, who was formerly the Federal Public Defender for California’s Central District.

For the past few years — in addition to his teaching and mentoring at Loyola — Kennedy is a member of the LA County Sheriff’s Department’s Civilian Oversight Commission (COC). He has become the COC’s resident expert on the deputy clique issue.

Yet, according to Kennedy, altogether apart from his oversight duties, an entirely different set of circumstances put the matter of LASD’s deputy cliques on his radar.

He explained how the members of his clinic represent clients in East LA, South LA, and other Los Angeles neighborhoods in juvenile court, pro bono. Not surprisingly, many of the clinic’s young clients are gang-involved — or accused of it, sometimes when they’re not — thus have been charged with gang enhancements, Kennedy said.

But, when his young attorneys met with the kids, their clients repeatedly described disturbing behavior on the part of local deputies. “Look the sheriff who arrested me and is acting as a gang expert,” they said, or words to that effect, “he’s in a gang himself.”

At first this seemed to be an extraordinary claim, Kennedy said. But after he and his clinic members, kept hearing that same message, they began to perform a new kind of due diligence.

“And when we started to look into it, we began to find serious evidence that the kids may be right.”

That pattern drew him and his law students to become interested in looking into the history of deputy gangs or cliques, in general, as well as into the cliques that appeared to be the most active, which in turn produced a series of papers for the COC, that WLA has cited previously.

Along with giving an overview of the department’s deputy cliques and gangs, the new report then analyzes the larger picture of how LASD “deputy gangs” have negatively impacted policing in Los Angeles, at the same time they have grievously “infected the fairness of legal proceedings” in the Los Angeles Superior Court.

“We have at least a 50-year history of unchecked deputy gangs in the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department,” Kennedy told WitnessLA. “The East LA Station is something of an incubator of deputy gangs,” he said, referring to the historic deputy clique known as the “Little Devils” or “Red Devils,” which was based in the East Los Angeles Station as far back as 1970, according to the report, “making it one of the earliest known deputy gangs.”

Now, of course, the Little Devils are long gone. Instead, the station is home to the Banditos, and to a station motto that characterizes the station as Fort Apache, a reference, that the report points out, “harkens back to the 1948 John Ford western of the same name, in which a remote U.S. cavalry outpost is surrounded by enemies whom the white officers regard as dangerous ‘savages.'”

A deputy gang, as the report defines it, is a subculture within the station “that has decided to meet together secretly, get a numbered tattoos, usually on the ankle or calf (but sometimes in other locations).

The tattoo, the CJLP authors write, “is usually a menacing figure,” such as a skeleton with a gun. The tattooed images “celebrate violence” and are sometimes numbered, so you know who was admitted when in the gang.

In the cases of certain gangs, “when you commit a police shooting or an act of violence, you may have your tattoo enhanced or embellished,” write the report’s authors. And the embellishments are a sign of status.

“The gangs have an us-against-them culture in the station, in which the deputy gang members view themselves as the best, most aggressive, gung-ho law enforcement officers. And they advance a heavy-handed, violent approach to policing.”

In general, the deputy gangs thrive in struggling communities, like East LA, South LA, and Compton, and also in the Antelope Valley stations where the Rattlesnakes are a deputy clique.

(Regarding the Rattlesnakes, the report notes that, the existence of that particular clique is corroborated by a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice report, which found “some Antelope Valley deputies wear tattoos or share paraphernalia with an intimidating skull and snake symbol as a mark of their affiliation with the Antelope Valley stations,” according to the DOJ writings. “Though there are varying interpretations of what these tattoos symbolize, they provide an undeniable visual representation of a gulf between deputies and the community and are an unfortunate reminder of LASD’s history of symbols associated with problematic deputy behavior.” A blueprint for change

When asked what he and his team hope to accomplish with the CJLP report, Kennedy told WitnessLA that he and his student researchers mean the report to be “objective and fair-minded,” with a blueprint for change.

The problem of deputy gangs has “been going on for 50 years, with all the county institutions looking the other way,” he said. “And I think most everyone understands that ignoring the problem has allowed deputy gangs to proliferate, and has made everything associated with them….worse.”

So the goal, according to Kennedy, “is to prompt real conversation” about what to do.

“There’s no doubt that we have a problem with deputy gangs. The jury is not out,” he said. “The idea that this is an open question for the Rand Corporation to answer, misses the point. I think the real question is: Now that we admit we’ve allowed this monster to grow, how do we fix it?”

It is that last question, having to do with solutions, that Kennedy says he and his volunteer law students have been working on for two years.

One critical first step, according to Kennedy, is to “demand that the sheriff release everything that is known about about all the different gangs and cliques. And then we have to ask why are all these young deputies want to join? Why is this an attractive option?”

The other critical question, according to Kennedy, is “why, year after year, do we see these militaristic clique gangs with names and symbols that vilify the people they are supposed to be assisting?”

Kennedy mentions former President Barack Obama’s 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing, “which repeatedly talks about policing through the lens of one basic question: “Do you have a warrior police culture, or a guardian police culture.”

The intention of the report is not to be critical of the department members, according to Kennedy. Having been on the COC for a few years now, said Kennedy, he’s come to understand the challenges police face daily.

“And I’ve met so many people in the department that I respect and like.”

But, “overall,” he said, for all those good people, “there is a dangerous culture of us-against-them, a culture of the warrior and the occupying army, that pervades the institution.”

Whereas, he said, the “guardian police culture cares what the members of the community being policed think.”

Yet, the warrior culture sees command and control as the highest value.

Exceptionalism, but not in a good way

LASD management has often stated that law enforcement gangs exist in many other departments, according to the Kennedy/Loyola reports, past and present.

“But my students and I have canvassed national newspapers and have not found reporting about law enforcement gangs in other jurisdictions, except for shorter periods of time in New Orleans and Oakland,” Kennedy said.

This suggests, he said, “that the problem is more unique to LASD than their management would like to admit.”

Furthermore, he said, “the failure of elected LA Sheriffs to do anything affirmative to investigate the internal gangs is likely one of the major reasons that they have persisted for so long.”

Yes, the LAPD had its notorious Rampart division in the early 1990s, a massive scandal that produced a sharp-toothed federal consent decree. But, while the LAPD still has some considerable challenges, worrying about gangster cops on the street has rarely been one of them. After the Rampart debacle, certain department leaders, including in 2002, the then head of the LAPD’s Training Division, George Gasćon, (who is now running for LA District Attorney against incumbent, Jackie Lacey) and a year later, LAPD Chief Bill Bratton, both used the consent decree as a tool to push through much needed reforms aimed at shoving the department culture toward constitutional policing.

Yet, decade after decade, write the Loyola researchers, under administration after administration, the LASD has declined to face its own urgent need for such reform when it comes to deputy cliques.

Clinging to deputy cliques has been costly, according to the report, which points to the estimate by the Office of Inspector General that, since 1990, LA County has spent at least $50 million on settlements and judgments related to use-of-force and misconduct by deputies known to have a clique tattoo.

But, write the authors, the actual settlement total is likely far higher, because, unless civil rights attorneys manage to turn up evidence of gangsters with badges who were prominently involved with their client’s case, “LASD management has refused to investigate whether any deputy involved in a shooting is affiliated with a deputy gang.” (One of the most prominent cases in which a victim did know a deputy gangster was involved was in the case of the wrongful conviction of Franky Carrillo, which was followed by 20 years in prison for the kid who had no criminal record. Carrillo always knew that his conviction was materially helped along by at least one admitted member of the Lynwood Vikings, who turned out to have manipulated evidence. In Carrillo’s case, his attorney, Ron Kaye, who made sure the deputy gang issue was included, got a settlement of $10.1 million for his client.)

The “to do” list

In its final section that is dedicated to solutions, the CJLP report points to the Twenty-First Century Policing model, which “emphasizes public transparency, meaningful engagement with oversight bodies, collaboration with community- based organizations, and true accountability for deputy misconduct.” Implementing this kind of model “of constitutional and community policing,” would be the best path forward for culture change “and the eradication of deputy gangs and cliques within the LASD,” according to the report’s authors.

But that prescriptive is also pretty general. With this in mind, the report offers nine specific recommendations, which are as follows:"
Greenland's ice wasn't expected to melt like this until 2070,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/456112-greenlands-ice-sheet-wasnt-expected-to-melt-like-this-until-2070,"During the past week, temperatures at the highest reaches of the Greenland ice sheet rose above freezing, melting snow at the Summit Station (10,550 feet above sea level) for the first time since July 2012 and perhaps only the third time in the last seven centuries.

Across lower elevations around the margins of the ice sheet, bare glacial ice melted at an unprecedented rate, losing 12.5 billion tons of water on Thursday alone, with daily losses likely exceeding any point in at least the past 70 years.

The Greenland ice sheet covers an area the size of Alaska with enough ice to raise global sea level by more than 20 feet. Greenland gains ice each winter from compacting snow accumulation and loses ice from melt water and icebergs discharged to the ocean. A dry, warm spring this year left a thin snow cover over bare glacial ice. Spring warming followed by a large melt event in June led scientist Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Greenland to predict record ice losses this year. The peak of the melt season passed in mid-July with more typical summer conditions, but the past week again saw a large increase in the area and intensity of melt across the Northern Hemisphere’s remaining ice sheet.



This latest heat wave was particularly unusual as a dome of warm air arrived from the east, associated with the remnants of the record-setting European heat wave last month. Most large melt events on Greenland involve warm, humid air masses arriving from North America and the western Atlantic Ocean. This surge of warm air started in North Africa, traveled north across Europe and then westward across the North Atlantic Ocean toward and across Greenland. Air masses originating over North Africa are known to reach Greenland — Saharan dust has been traced to the ice sheet — but this recent air mass was exceptionally warm. By following the path of the heat wave, scientists predicted the extensive melt several days in advance. Air temperatures at Summit hovered near or above freezing for more than 11 hours on Wednesday, which is nearly twice as long as the last melt event there in 2012.



Satellite data that I process for the National Snow and Ice Data Center showed more than 60 percent of the surface area of the ice sheet melting last Wednesday. While this is a smaller melt area than in mid-July 2012, the melt extent was second only to 2012 for late July. More detailed satellite images show that snow has melted from a large area along the western edge of the ice sheet, leaving more exposed ice than in 2012 in several areas. Numerous meltwater rivers and lakes, and dark, dust-encrusted ice reached areas higher on the ice sheet. Images comparing summer 2018 and summer 2019 show a larger area of bare ice and meltwater lakes this summer. Several of the Danish Meteorological Institute weather stations on the ice sheet have recorded greater melt rates in 2019 than in 2012.



In July 2012, the public watched video of melt water runoff raging down the Watson River, near Greenland’s main international airport at Kangerlussuaq. The flood waters destroyed the bridge’s approaches and prevented travel across the river, which have since been rebuilt. This past week, journalist Laurie Garrett recorded similar images of Watson River flooding. Meanwhile, further north near the U.S. Thule Air Force Base, less than 1,000 miles from the North Pole, scientist Pete Akers at the Institute of Geosciences and Environment in Grenoble reported temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, ice margin collapse, meltwater pouring into new channels and into the ocean.



While the ice losses on any individual day make only modest contributions to global sea level, the increasing frequency of heat waves and large melt events across Greenland during the past two decades contribute significantly to sea level rise. When the entire surface of the ice sheet melted in July 2012, climatologists and glaciologists told the public that these melt events will become more common in the future. While some recent years, such as 2017, have seen more modest melt seasons, we again witnessed record-setting losses from the ice sheet this summer.

Mass losses from Greenland this past week were already approaching levels not expected until 2070 based on the best available models. It is still too early to tell if the ice losses for the summer will exceed the losses in 2012, but it is clear that the Greenland ice sheet is rapidly responding to climate change, even faster than many scientists expected. These rapid changes point to the necessity for action on climate change and for improved observing systems to monitor the ice sheet.

Thomas Mote is a distinguished research professor of Geography and Atmospheric Science at the University of Georgia. He has published research for the past 25 years on Arctic climate change and the use of regional climate models and remote sensing to monitor the Greenland ice sheet. He provides the processed satellite data for the Greenland Today website at the National Snow and Ice Data Center."

Doyle Rice | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption Climate change: How a warmer Earth could mean more snow Climate change is making winters colder despite rising temperatures and hotter summers. Here’s why.

By 2070, up to 3 billion people are likely to live in climate conditions 'deemed unsuitable for human life to flourish.'

Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could halve the number of people exposed to such hot conditions.

The study was prepared by an international research team of archaeologists, ecologists and climate scientists.

If global warming continues unchecked, the heat that's coming later this century in some parts of the world will bring ""nearly unlivable"" conditions for up to 3 billion people, a study released Monday said.

The authors predict that by 2070, much of the world's population is likely to live in climate conditions that are ""warmer than conditions deemed suitable for human life to flourish.""

The study warned that unless greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed, average annual temperatures will rise beyond the climate ""niche"" in which humans have thrived for 6,000 years.

That ""niche"" is equivalent to average yearly temperatures of roughly 52 to 59 Fahrenheit. The researchers found that people, despite all forms of innovations and migrations, have mostly lived in these climate conditions for several thousand years.

""We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 years than it has moved (in the past 6,000 years),"" the study warned.

Climate change: 2020 expected to be Earth's warmest year on record, scientists say

The future scenario used in the paper is one in which atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are high. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas releases “greenhouse” gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane into Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. The emissions have caused the planet’s temperatures to rise to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, scientists report.

Temperatures over the next few decades are projected to increase rapidly as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions.

Without climate mitigation or migration, by 2070 a substantial part of humanity will be exposed to average annual temperatures warmer than nearly anywhere today, the study said. These brutally hot climate conditions are currently experienced by just 0.8% of the global land surface, mostly in the hottest parts of the Sahara Desert, but by 2070 the conditions could spread to 19% of the Earth’s land area.

This includes large portions of northern Africa, the Middle East, northern South America, South Asia, and parts of Australia.

""Large areas of the planet would heat to barely survivable levels and they wouldn’t cool down again,"" said study co-author Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands. ""Not only would this have devastating direct effects, it leaves societies less able to cope with future crises like new pandemics. The only thing that can stop this happening is a rapid cut in carbon emissions.”

Arctic warming: Arctic will see ice-free summers by 2050 as globe warms, study says

Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could halve the number of people exposed to such hot conditions. “The good news is that these impacts can be greatly reduced if humanity succeeds in curbing global warming,” said study co-author Tim Lenton, a climate specialist from the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.

“Our computations show that each degree warming (Celsius) above present levels corresponds to roughly 1 billion people falling outside of the climate niche,"" Lenton said. ""It is important that we can now express the benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions in something more human than just monetary terms.”

The study, which was prepared by an international research team of archaeologists, ecologists and climate scientists, was published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."
"Millions of US farm animals to be culled by suffocation, drowning and shooting",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/millions-of-us-farm-animals-to-be-culled-by-suffocation-drowning-and-shooting-coronavirus,"Closure of meat plants due to coronavirus means ‘depopulation’ of hens and pigs with methods experts say are inhumane, despite unprecedented demand at food banks

More than 10 million hens are estimated to have been culled due to Covid-19 related slaughterhouse shutdowns. The majority will have been smothered by a water-based foam, similar to fire-fighting foam, a method that animal welfare groups are calling “inhumane”.

The pork industry has warned that more than 10 million pigs could be culled by September for the same reason. The techniques used to cull pigs include gassing, shooting, anaesthetic overdose, or “blunt force trauma”.

In “constrained circumstances”, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), techniques [pdf] might also include a combination of shutting down pig barn ventilator systems with the addition of CO2 so the animals suffocate.

The ‘depopulation’ comes despite food banks across the US reporting unprecedented demand and widespread hunger during the pandemic, with six-mile-long queues for aid forming at some newly set up distribution centres.

The American meat supply chain has been hit hard by the closure of slaughterhouses, due to Covid-19 infection rates among workers. 30 to 40 plants have closed, which means that in the highly consolidated US system beef and pork slaughtering capacity has been cut by 25% and 40% respectively, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).

The closures have meant that animals cannot be killed for food and many must instead be culled, or “depopulated” at home.

More pigs to be ‘depopulated’

As it is comparatively easier to keep cattle on farms, cow culls do not appear to be an issue as yet, and the chicken cull may have peaked, said Adam Speck, an agribusiness analyst with IHS Markit.

“[Cattle] could stay on ranches another six months if necessary. The peak of the chicken cull has passed for now. North of about 10 million chickens were depopulated, either at the chick or egg stage,” Speck said.

At the hen stage, Leah Garcés, president of US welfare organisation Mercy for Animals, said it is hard to be sure of the numbers. But, “what we know with certainty is that 2 million meat chickens [and] 61,000 laying hens”, have been killed on farms.

Compared with poultry, said Garcés, stopping or slowing the production cycle of pigs is harder, mainly because pig growing periods are about six months compared to six weeks for hens. “Pregnancies had already been set in motion when the slaughterhouse closures occurred,” she said, and pigs were already in the system.

The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) has estimated that: “up to 10,069,000 market hogs will need to be euthanised between the weeks ending on 25 April and 19 September 2020, resulting in a severe emotional and financial toll on hog farmers”.

For pig culls, AVMA “preferred methods” include injectable anaesthetic overdose, gassing, shooting with guns or bolts, electrocution and manual blunt force trauma. AVMA methods “permitted in constrained circumstances” include ventilator shutdown (VSD), potentially combined with carbon dioxide gassing, and sodium nitrite which would be ingested by pigs.

Speaking more graphically, Garcés said manual blunt force trauma can mean slamming piglets against the ground while VSD would “essentially cook the pigs alive”.

Asked to estimate numbers of pigs that have already been culled, Speck said producers are very reluctant to depopulate. “About two million might have been culled so far due to the Covid-19 pandemic, over the last six or so weeks.”

Speck added that with slaughterhouses likely to return to 85% capacity by the end of May, the NPPC’s depopulation estimate of 10 million pigs could be significantly reduced.

Speck said breeders are thinning herds and slowing growth to reduce pig supply. “They are sending breeding sows to slaughter, aborting pregnant sows on a small scale and [keeping market-bound pigs] on maintenance style rations with less protein. Coming into the summer months the pigs will also gain weight more slowly as the weather heats up.”

Methods are ‘inhumane’

Asked about growth slowdown, Garcés said it posed other welfare risks. “One method to slow down growth is to turn the heat up inside of the warehouses beyond the pigs ‘comfort zone’ because pigs eat less when they are too hot,” she said.

The combination of feed restrictions and higher barn temperatures, she said, mean pigs are “hungry and hot, increasing their overall discomfort, which is already high in a factory farm setting”.

In what appears to be an attempt by the industry to reduce any negative depopulation impact, a blog managed by the National Pork Board called Real Pig Farming offers social media sharing tips for farmers. The blog suggests farmers: “Think twice before engaging with posts that show what may be happening on farms right now.”



It said: “Most people do not understand the complexity of raising pigs and getting pork from the farm to their table. That means, “[a] good rule of thumb is to speak to a level a third grader [eight to 10 years old] would understand to ensure that things are not taken out of context.”



NPPC spokesperson Jim Monroe said that as of the week ending on 15 May, less than 25% of overall slaughter capacity was idled and the situation was improving. Monroe, added that the “tragic need to euthanise animals is to prevent animal suffering.”



For poultry, culling options are no easier. Filling sheds with carbon dioxide gas is one method, said Kim Sturla, director of welfare organisation Animal Place. Another cull method, she said, is to smother hens with water-based foam, similar to firefighting foam. Water-based foaming is categorised as the “preferred” method by the AVMA.

Previously asked about water-based foaming and other cull methods such VSD, an AVMA spokesperson said depopulation decisions were difficult and “and contingent upon several factors, such as the species and number of animals involved, available means of animal restraint, safety of personnel, and other considerations such as availability of equipment, agents and personnel”.

European campaigners said firefighting foam causes prolonged suffering. Although risks of similar livestock culls appear low in Europe so far, welfare group, Compassion in World Farming advised using foam that contains nitrogen gas because death is faster.



A 2019 European Food Safety Authority journal report said it did not find water-based or firefighting foam acceptable because “death due to drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways” is not seen as “a humane method for killing animals, including poultry”."
Every $1 increase in minimum wage decreases suicide rate by up to 6%,https://www.zmescience.com/science/minimum-wage-suicide-link-04233/,"Credit: Pixabay.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people in high-income countries, after road injury. According to the World Health Organization, the intervention that has the most imminent potential to bring down the number of suicides is restricting access to pesticides that can be used for self-poisoning. However, a more effective measure may be improving the standard of living by raising the minimum wage. A 26-year study found that for every single US dollar increase in the minimum wage, the suicide rate falls by 3.5% to 6%.

“Despite progress [worldwide], one person still dies every 40 seconds from suicide,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every death is a tragedy for family, friends and colleagues. Yet suicides are preventable. We call on all countries to incorporate proven suicide prevention strategies into national health and education programmes in a sustainable way.”

In 2017, suicides accounted for nearly one in five deaths among young people aged 18 to 24. The number of preventable suicide deaths has only increased over the years in the United States, with suicide rates jumping by more than 30% in half of all states between 1999 and 2017.

A combination of individual, relationship, community, and societal factors contribute to the risk of suicide, including a family history of suicide, alcohol and substance abuse, and physical illness.

Financial stressors have always been associated with suicide risk, but less was known about the potential impact some economic interventions might have on suicide rates.

Researchers at the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta wanted to fill the gap in our knowledge. To this aim, they looked at the difference between the effective state and federal minimum hourly wage for all 50 states and Washington DC and state unemployment and suicide rates.

The analysis covered 18- to 64-year olds and looked at changes in the minimum wage for every month between 1990 and 2015.

Between 1990 and 2015, there were 478 changes in state minimum wages across US states. The average difference in wages between the states at and above the federal minimum wage was US$ 2,200/year for a full-time employee.

During the same time period, nearly 400,000 people with a high school education or less took their own lives compared with nearly 140,000 people with a college degree or higher.

Increases in the minimum wage seem to have no impact on the suicide rate among those with a college degree, likely because stressors other than finances prompted them to take their own lives. However, there was a significant effect among those with a high school education or less — every dollar increase in the minimum wage led to a 3.5-6% reduction in suicides.

This relationship was mitigated by state-level unemployment rate. When there weren’t enough jobs, progressively higher minimum wages were linked to lower suicide rates. This association weakened when unemployment was low.

Bearing these estimates in mind, the authors of the new study calculated that 13,800 suicides could have been prevented between 2009 (a peak unemployment year following the financial crash) and 2015 if the minimum wage had increased by $1. A $2 increase would have prevented 25,900 suicides."
"In the future, only the rich will be able to escape the unbearable heat from climate change. In Iraq, it’s already happening",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/climate-change-apartheid-poor-iraq-effects-heatwave-a9049206.html,"“ It’s death,” says 17-year-old Muhammad, as he swelters behind the counter at the hardware store where he works in central Baghdad.

The temperature is 48C and there is no escaping it. The electricity is out in his neighbourhood and he can’t afford a generator to power an air conditioner. And it’s more of the same at home.

“I wake up during the night covered in sweat,” he says, in a low voice. “It’s exhausting. The heat makes you feel awful.”

Iraq is used to the stifling summer heat, but the few tools its residents have at their disposal to stay cool are becoming unaffordable for the country’s poor.

At a time when European countries are enduring some of the highest temperatures ever recorded, and as extreme weather becomes more common, Baghdad offers a troubling glimpse into a future where only the wealthy are equipped to escape the effects of climate change.

A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.

In Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C days, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.

The crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid – has exacerbated the country’s energy divide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.

“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”

Abu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off.

“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”

Iraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.

Nearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.

Professor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.

“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable individuals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.

“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”

Iraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.

As the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.

Last month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C in the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings – and for good reason.

High temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.

As it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.

The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.

The rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.

But as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.

“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”

And while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster.

A 2018, report produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.

“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C by 2050.

Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year.

“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C in August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.

“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”

Deadly dust storm descends on southern Iraq

According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.

“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says.

But despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far. Protesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer."
The chance of a 15-year-old boy dying by the age of 50 is now higher in America than in Bangladesh.,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/22/the-un-revises-down-its-population-forecasts?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/theunrevisesdownitspopulationforecastsdemography,"T HE UNITED NATIONS is the world’s most important watcher of human tides. Its demographers have a good record of predicting global population change, although they have made mistakes about individual countries. So it is worth paying attention when the UN revises its figures, as it does every few years. The latest bulletin is especially surprising.

Recent revisions have sent the projected global population upwards. The one released on June 17th cuts it back. The UN now thinks the world will contain a little over 9.7bn people in 2050 and just under 10.9bn in 2100. The first figure is 37m lower than the UN forecast two years ago. The latter is 309m lower—almost an America’s worth of people revised away.

Birth rates are falling faster than expected in some developing countries. In the late 1980s Kenya had a fertility rate of 6.5, implying a woman could expect to have that many children. Two years ago the UN reckoned Kenya’s fertility rate would drop to 2.1 (the point at which the population sustains itself naturally) only in the late 2070s. Because of new data, it now thinks Kenya will reach that point a decade earlier. Uganda also looks less fecund. A smaller cut to India’s fertility rate has a big effect on the global population forecasts because India has so many people.

The UN ’s population model assumes that countries with fertility rates well below two will bounce back a little. Even in countries where babies have become rare, most people continue to believe that the ideal family contains two or even three kids. But the recovery keeps failing to happen in some places, so the demographers have changed their forecasts in a second way. They now expect some countries with extremely low birth rates, such as Italy, Japan and South Korea, to stay that way for years. Korea, which has a fertility rate of just 1.1, is now expected to have 30m people in 2100—down from 51m today.

Another change has to do with death. Most people are living longer. The biggest improvement is in east and southern Africa, where HIV is being treated better. In America, however, the opioid epidemic has pushed up the death rate, especially for men. The chance of a 15-year-old boy dying by the age of 50 is now higher in America than in Bangladesh. It would be nice if the American forecast, at least, proved to be too pessimistic. ◼

The fossil-fuel industry is lawyering up. To date, nine cities have sued the fossil industry for climate damages. California fisherman are going after oil companies for their role in warming the Pacific Ocean, a process that soaks the Dungeness crabs they harvest with a dangerous neurotoxin. Former acting New York state attorney general Barbara Underwood has opened an investigation into whether ExxonMobil has misled its shareholders about the risks it faces from climate change, a push current Attorney General Leticia James has said she is eager to keep up. Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey opened an earlier investigation into whether Exxon defrauded the public by spreading disinformation about climate change, which various courts — including the Supreme Court — have refused to block despite the company’s pleas.

These are welcome attempts to hold the industry responsible for its role in warming our earth. It’s time, however, to take this series of legal proceedings to the next level: we should try fossil-fuel executives for crimes against humanity.

Guilty Beyond a Reasonable Doubt Just one hundred fossil fuel producers — including privately held and state-owned companies — have been responsible for 71 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions released since 1988, emissions that have already killed at least tens of thousands of people through climate-fueled disasters worldwide. Green New Deal advocates have been right to focus on the myriad ways that decarbonization can improve the lives of working-class Americans. But an important complement to that is holding those most responsible for the crisis fully accountable. It’s the right thing to do, and it makes clear to fossil-fuel executives that they could face consequences beyond vanishing profits. More immediately, a push to try fossil-fuel executives for crimes against humanity could channel some much-needed populist rage at the climate’s 1 percent, and render them persona non grata in respectable society — let alone Congress or the UN, where they today enjoy broad access. Making people like Exxon CEO Darren Woods or Shell CEO Ben van Beurden well known and widely reviled would put names and faces to a problem too often discussed in the abstract. The climate fight has clear villains. It’s long past time to name and shame them. Left unchecked, the death toll of climate change could easily creep up into the hundreds of millions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in turn unleashing chaos and suffering that’s simply impossible to project. An independent report commissioned by twenty governments in 2012 found that climate impacts are already causing an estimated four hundred thousand deaths per year. Counting a wider range of casualties attributed to burning fossil fuels — air pollution, indoor smoke, occupational hazards, and skin cancer — that figure jumps to nearly 5 million a year. By 2030, annual climate and carbon-related deaths are expected to reach nearly 6 million. That’s the rough equivalent of one Holocaust every year, which in just a few short years could surpass the total number of people killed in World War II. All caused by the fossil-fuel industry. Knowing full well the deadly consequences of continued drilling, the individuals at the helm of fossil-fuel companies each day choose to seek out new reserves to burn as quickly as possible to keep their shareholders happy. They use every possible tool — and they have many — to sabotage regulatory action. That we need to instead strip fossil fuels from the global economy isn’t up for debate. Without the increasingly distant-seeming deployment of speculative, so-called negative emissions technologies, coal usage will have to decline by 97 percent, oil by 87 percent, and gas by 74 percent by 2050 for us to have a halfway decent shot at keeping warming below 1.5 degrees celsius. That’s what it will take to avert pervasive, catastrophic climate impacts that will destabilize the very foundations of society. (Keeping warming to a more dangerous 2.0 degrees celsius will require decarbonization that’s almost as abrupt.) A recent report by Oil Change International detailing the climate costs of continued drilling lays the problem out in simple terms: either we embark on a managed decline of the fossil-fuel industry, or we face economic and ecological ruin. Simply put, the business model of the fossil-fuel industry is incompatible with the continued existence of anything we might recognize as human civilization. Barring a major course correction, that business model — and more specifically, the executives who have designed and executed it — will be responsible for untold suffering within many of our lifetimes, with the youngest and poorest among us bearing a disproportionate burden, along with people of color and residents of the Global South. As recent research and reporting have documented, some of the world’s biggest polluters have known for decades about the deadly threat of global warming and the role their products play in fueling it. Some companies began research into climate change as early as the 1950s. These days, none can claim not to know the mortal danger posed by their ongoing extraction.

Literally a Crime Against Humanity Technically speaking, what fossil-fuel companies do isn’t genocide. Low-lying islands and communities around the world are and will continue to be the worst hit by climate impacts. Still, the case against the fossil-fuel industry is not that their executives are targeting specific “national, ethnical, racial, or religious” groups for annihilation, per the Rome Statute, which enumerates the various types of human rights abuses that can be heard before the International Criminal Court. Rather, the fossil industry’s behavior constitutes a Crime Against Humanity in the classical sense: “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack,” including murder and extermination. Unlike genocide, the UN clarifies, in the case of crimes against humanity, it is not necessary to prove that there is an overall specific intent. It suffices for there to be a simple intent to commit any of the acts listed…The perpetrator must also act with knowledge of the attack against the civilian population and that his/her action is part of that attack. Fossil-fuel executives may not have intended to destroy the world as we know it. And climate change may not look like the kinds of attacks we’re used to. But they’ve known what their industry is doing to the planet for a long time, and the effects are likely to be still more brutal if the causes are allowed to continue.

The Evidence Stacks Up In September 2015 InsideClimate News broke the story that Exxon scientists first started looking into climate change in the mid-1970s. It didn’t take them long to find out both that it was a real problem and that their bread and butter was a chief cause. When the rest of the United States learned of these dangers — thanks in part to James Hansen’s testimony before Congress in 1988 — Exxon and friends began pouring millions of dollars into elaborate disinformation campaigns casting doubt on findings their own scientists had validated. Dutch journalist Jelmer Mommers has unearthed many incriminating documents about similar actions taken by Shell, including a 1988 report showing that their executives were fully aware of the danger that climate change posed and the company’s own role in it. The report’s authors found that their own products accounted for an estimated 4 percent of the world’s carbon emissions in 1984. “With very long time scales involved,” company scientists recommended, “it would be tempting for society to wait until then to begin doing anything. The potential implications for the world are, however, so large, that policy options need to be considered much earlier. And the energy industry needs to consider how it should play its part.” In response to the documents revealed in Mommers’s article, Friends of the Earth Netherlands has announced it will bring a suit against Shell to rapidly begin winding down its oil and gas production. Industry-funded disinformation campaigns would shape the United States’ national conversation on climate politics for the decades after Hansen’s testimony, and still do. But sensing a change in the political weather, fossil-fuel companies have taken on a new double identity. With one hand — or maybe just a few fingers — they espouse their commitment to climate action and even documents like the Paris Agreement. With the other they continually hunt for new markets and planet-wrecking reserves, sending legions of lobbyists into Washington to beef up subsidies and tear up regulations, and fighting even modest policies to rein in their actions. Despite clear culpability, the industry’s attempts to present itself as a good-faith actor in the climate fight are largely succeeding. Industry shills stalk the halls of the United Nations’ annual climate talks, appearing at side events alongside respected environmental NGOs and UNFCCC officials, and chatting freely with national delegations. At COP 24 last year in Poland, GasNaturally cohosted a cocktail hour with the European Union, and Shell bragged about its influence in grafting a whole section onto the Paris Agreement. The Polish coal sector was a main sponsor of the whole event. Stateside, advocates of certain forms of carbon pricing — like one plan drafted up by former Bush and Reagan cabinet officials— have boasted of garnering support and funding from the likes of Exxon and BP, apparently a marker of their respectability. When one such policy actually came up for a vote in Washington State last year, though, BP and other oil producers spent tens of millions of dollars to crush it. We’ve let them get away with it for too long.

The Nuremberg Precedent Let’s call this what it is: an atmosphere of impunity for atrocity. At the very least, the fossil-fuel industry should be barred from international climate negotiations and any national-level climate policymaking discussions, just like the tobacco industry and its emissaries are barred from World Health Organization talks. In the US, that ban should include the congresspeople on both sides of the aisle that the industry deputizes to act on their behalf with hefty campaign contributions. There were more than a few good reasons, after all, that the Allies didn’t invite Hitler to weigh in on their strategy for crushing the Nazis. After the war, though, the ensuing Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals wrote an important precedent into international law, establishing that “crimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced.” At that point, there was no legal framework to understand violence on the scale of those that Hitler’s regime had just carried out, let alone to punish it. To remedy that the international community came together to create and implement one. On climate, the precedent set in Nuremberg offers other lessons as well. It’s hard to think of a problem more widely attributed to “abstract entities” than global warming, allegedly the product of some unquenchable, ubiquitous human thirst for new stuff. That old Pogo cartoon still holds sway in the popular imagination: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” There’s some truth to that — we do all create demand for fossil fuels, after all. But supply creates demand. And while free market dogmatists may think otherwise, there’s no reason why the popularity of a product means it should exist in perpetuity when the risks are so colossal and there are alternatives at the ready. One of the best parallels for trying corporate executives for crimes against humanity might be the so-called IG Farben Trials, in which executives of the IG Farben Company — which worked with the Nazis to produce Zyklon B gas, a pesticide used extensively to kill Jews in the Holocaust — were tried before US Military Courts in Nuremberg. The company also developed several processes that aided in the Nazi war effort, like synthesizing rubber and oil out of coal. They employed slave labor provided by the Nazis, even constructing a factory just outside of Auschwitz so they could put prisoners to work. Farben executives and plant managers were tried on these and other charges. Just thirteen of the twenty-four indicted were found guilty, and the longest sentence anyone of them served was eight years, including time served. After prison, several went on to lucrative consulting gigs and board positions for German chemicals companies, including former subsidiaries of the now-disbanded IG Farben, and companies like Dow Chemical. After serving his four-year prison term for the “plundering and spoliation of occupied territories,” IG Farben CEO Hermann Schmitz went on to take a senior post at Deutsche Bank. The head of the company that would become the war’s largest distributor of Zyklon-B — Bruno Tesch — fared less well. He was tried separately before a British military tribunal and executed, alongside his second-in-command. Court documents detailed precisely how much money he and his main business partners had made from selling the agent to the Nazis."
Average American worker takes less vacation than a medieval peasant,https://www.businessinsider.com/american-worker-less-vacation-medieval-peasant-2016-11,"Life for the medieval peasant was certainly no picnic. His life was shadowed by fear of famine, disease and bursts of warfare. His diet and personal hygiene left much to be desired.

But despite his reputation as a miserable wretch, you might envy him one thing: his vacations.

Plowing and harvesting were backbreaking toil, but the peasant enjoyed anywhere from eight weeks to half the year off.

The Church, mindful of how to keep a population from rebelling, enforced frequent mandatory holidays. Weddings, wakes, and births might mean a week off quaffing ale to celebrate, and when wandering jugglers or sporting events came to town, the peasant expected time off for entertainment. There were labor-free Sundays, and when the plowing and harvesting seasons were over, the peasant got time to rest, too.

In fact, economist Juliet Shor found that during periods of particularly high wages, such as 14th-century England, peasants might put in no more than 150 days a year. As for the modern American worker? After a year on the job, she gets an average of eight vacation days annually.

A history of dwindling vacation days

It wasn't supposed to turn out this way: John Maynard Keynes, one of the founders of modern economics, made a famous prediction that by 2030, advanced societies would be wealthy enough that leisure time, rather than work, would characterize national lifestyles. So far, that forecast is not looking good.

What happened? Some cite the victory of the modern eight-hour a day, 40-hour workweek over the punishing 70 or 80 hours a 19th century worker spent toiling as proof that we're moving in the right direction.

But Americans have long since kissed the 40-hour workweek goodbye, and Shor's examination of work patterns reveals that the 19th century was an aberration in the history of human labor. When workers fought for the eight-hour workday, they weren't trying to get something radical and new, but rather to restore what their ancestors had enjoyed before industrial capitalists and the electric light bulb came on the scene.

Go back 200, 300, or 400 years and you find that most people did not work very long hours at all. In addition to relaxing during long holidays, the medieval peasant took his sweet time eating meals, and the day often included time for an afternoon snooze.

""The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed,"" notes Shor. ""Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure.""

Fast-forward to the 21st century, and the US is the only advanced country with no national vacation policy whatsoever.

Many American workers must keep on working through public holidays, and vacation days often go unused. Even when we finally carve out a holiday, many of us answer emails and ""check in"" whether we're camping with the kids or trying to kick back on the beach.

Some blame the American worker for not taking what is her due. But in a period of consistently high unemployment, job insecurity and weak labor unions, employees may feel no choice but to accept the conditions set by the culture and the individual employer.

In a world of ""at will"" employment, where the work contract can be terminated at any time, it's not easy to raise objections.

It's true that the New Deal brought back some of the conditions that farm workers and artisans from the Middle Ages took for granted, but since the 1980s things have gone steadily downhill. With secure long-term employment slipping away, people jump from job to job, so seniority no longer offers the benefits of additional days off. The rising trend of hourly and part-time work, stoked by the Great Recession, means that for many, the idea of a guaranteed vacation is a dim memory.

The consequences of constantly working

Ironically, this cult of endless toil doesn't really help the bottom line.

Study after study shows that overworking reduces productivity. On the other hand, performance increases after a vacation, and workers come back with restored energy and focus. The longer the vacation, the more relaxed and energized people feel upon returning to the office.

Economic crises give austerity-minded politicians excuses to talk of decreasing time off, increasing the retirement age and cutting into social insurance programs and safety nets that were supposed to allow us a fate better than working until we drop. In Europe, where workers average 25 to 30 days off per year, politicians like French President Francois Hollande and former Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras have sent signals that the culture of longer vacations is coming to an end.

But the belief that shorter vacations bring economic gains doesn't appear to add up.

flickr / Robert S. Donovan According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the Greeks, who face a horrible economy, work more hours than any other Europeans. In Germany, an economic powerhouse, workers rank second to last in number of hours worked. Despite more time off, German workers are the eighth most productive in Europe, while the long-toiling Greeks rank 24 out of 25 in productivity.

Beyond burnout, vanishing vacations make our relationships with families and friends suffer. Our health is deteriorating: depression and higher risk of death are among the outcomes for our no-vacation nation. Some forward-thinking people have tried to reverse this trend, like progressive economist Robert Reich, who has argued in favor of a mandatory three weeks off for all American workers. Congressman Alan Grayson proposed the Paid Vacation Act of 2009, but alas, the bill didn't even make it to the floor of Congress.

Speaking of Congress, its members seem to be the only people in America getting as much down time as the medieval peasant. In recent years, they've gotten upward of 239 days in vacation time."
First coup of the pandemic? Bolsonaro possibly pushed aside by military,https://www.brasilwire.com/does-brazil-already-have-a-new-acting-president/,"It is being reported that, under pressure from the Army, Walter Braga Netto is now the “operational president” of Brazil, with Jair Bolsonaro effectively stripped of his decision making powers. According to veteran Argentine investigative journalist Horacio Verbitsky, this has already been communicated informally to the Argentine authorities. There has been as yet no official confirmation.

By Lucas Rocha. Revista Forúm

President Jair Bolsonaro’s excesses in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Brazil have irritated the Armed Forces’ high command, which now appears to have “elected” Chief of Staff, Walter Braga Netto, as the country’s new “operational president”.

According to the Argentine investigative journalist Horacio Verbitsky, a high ranking official of the Brazilian Army communicated to their Argentine counterpart that President Jair Bolsonaro is not being heard by the authorities when making decisions.

“There was a telephone communication from a high ranking Brazilian army official with one from Argentina, in which the Brazilian informed them that they had taken the decision to circumvent President Bolsonaro in all important decisions,” said the journalist on the program “Habrá Consecuencias”, from Radio El Destape .

Verbitsky affirms that Bolsonaro is acting as a “monarch without effective power” and who now commands the country is General Walter Braga Netto.

In recent days, Braga Netto’s stance at press conferences has caught the attention of the media. The general has tried to control the responses of those present and even overruled other ministers .

Braga Netto, who was the commander of the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro in 2018, was appointed to the Federal Government’s coronavirus committee as coordinator. According to the DefenseNet portal, in reality, he now acts as “Chief of Staff of the Planalto”, corroborating the Argentine journalist’s claims.

According to the website, “The new ‘informal mission’ was the product of a deal involving ministers and military commanders and the President of the Republic himself,”

“His ‘mission’ is to reduce the president’s exposure, leaving him in position ‘democratically’, to behave as if he does not belong to his own government. The general will begin to shape the executive’s actions in the (Coronavirus) crisis. He may even contradict Bolsonaro’s statements,” placing Bolsonaro in the same position as “a monarch without effective power ”.

"""Civilizations in the final stages of decay are dominated by elites out of touch with reality. Societies strain harder and harder to sustain the decadent opulence of the ruling class, even as it destroys the foundations of productivity and wealth.""- Chris Hedges",http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/time_to_get_crazy_20120702//,"Native Americans’ resistance to the westward expansion of Europeans took two forms. One was violence. The other was accommodation. Neither worked. Their land was stolen, their communities were decimated, their women and children were gunned down and the environment was ravaged. There was no legal recourse. There was no justice. There never is for the oppressed. And as we face similar forces of predatory, unchecked corporate power intent on ruthless exploitation and stripping us of legal and physical protection, we must confront how we will respond.

The ideologues of rapacious capitalism, like members of a primitive cult, chant the false mantra that natural resources and expansion are infinite. They dismiss calls for equitable distribution as unnecessary. They say that all will soon share in the “expanding” wealth, which in fact is swiftly diminishing. And as the whole demented project unravels, the elites flee like roaches to their sanctuaries. At the very end, it all will come down like a house of cards.

Civilizations in the final stages of decay are dominated by elites out of touch with reality. Societies strain harder and harder to sustain the decadent opulence of the ruling class, even as it destroys the foundations of productivity and wealth. Karl Marx was correct when he called unregulated capitalism “a machine for demolishing limits.” This failure to impose limits cannibalizes natural resources and human communities. This time, the difference is that when we go the whole planet will go with us. Catastrophic climate change is inevitable. Arctic ice is in terminal decline. There will soon be so much heat trapped in the atmosphere that any attempt to scale back carbon emissions will make no difference. Droughts. Floods. Heat waves. Killer hurricanes and tornados. Power outages. Freak weather. Rising sea levels. Crop destruction. Food shortages. Plagues.

ExxonMobil, BP and the coal and natural gas companies — like the colonial buffalo hunters who left thousands of carcasses rotting in the sun after stripping away the hides, and in some cases carrying away only the tongues — will never impose rational limits on themselves. They will exploit, like the hustlers before them who eliminated the animals that sustained the native peoples of the Great Plains, until there is nothing left to exploit. Collective suicide is never factored into quarterly profit reports. Forget all those virtuous words they taught you in school about our system of government. The real words to describe American power are “plunder,” “fraud,” “criminality,” “deceit,” “murder” and “repression.”

Those native communities that were most accommodating to the European colonists, such as the peaceful California tribes — the Chilulas, Chimarikos, Urebures, Nipewais and Alonas, along with a hundred other bands — were the first to be destroyed. And while I do not advocate violence, indeed will seek every way to avoid it, I have no intention of accommodating corporate power whether it hides behind the mask of Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. At the same time, I have to acknowledge that resistance may ultimately be in vain. Yet to resist is to say something about us as human beings. It keeps alive the possibility of hope, even as all empirical evidence points to inevitable destruction. It makes victory, however remote, possible. And it makes life a little more difficult for the ruling class, which satisfies the very human emotion of vengeance.

“Whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power,” wrote the philosopher John Locke, “they put themselves into a state of war with the people who are thereupon absolved from any further obedience.”

The European colonists signed, and ignored, some 400 treaties with native tribes. They enticed the native leaders into accords, always to seize land, and then repeated the betrayal again and again and again until there was nothing left to steal. Chiefs such as Black Kettle who believed the white men did not fare much better than those who did not. Black Kettle, who outside his lodge often flew a huge American flag given to him in Washington as a sign of friendship, was shot dead by soldiers of George Armstrong Custer in November 1868 along with his wife and more than 100 other Cheyenne in his encampment on the Washita River.

The white men “made us many promises, more than I can remember,” Chief Red Cloud said in old age, “but they kept but one. They promised to take our land, and they took it.”

Native societies, in which people redistributed wealth to gain respect, and in which those who hoarded were detested, upheld a communal ethic that had to be obliterated and replaced with the greed, ceaseless exploitation and cult of the self that fuel capitalist expansion. Lewis Henry Morgan in his book “League of the Iroquois,” written in 1851 after he lived among them, noted that the Iroquois’ “whole civil policy was averse to the concentration of power in the hands of any single individual, but inclined to the opposite principle of division among a number of equals. …” This was a way of relating to each other, as well as to the natural world, that was an anathema to the European colonizers.Those who exploit do so through layers of deceit. They hire charming and eloquent interlocutors. How many more times do you want to be lied to by Barack Obama? What is this penchant for self-delusion that makes us unable to see that we are being sold into bondage? Why do we trust those who do not deserve our trust? Why are we repeatedly seduced? The promised closure of Guantanamo. The public option in health care. Reforming the Patriot Act. Environmental protection. Restoring habeas corpus. Regulating Wall Street. Ending the wars. Jobs. Defending labor rights. I could go on.

There are few resistance figures in American history as noble as Crazy Horse. He led, long after he knew that ultimate defeat was inevitable, the most effective revolt on the plains, wiping out Custer and his men on the Little BigHorn. “Even the most basic outline of his life shows how great he was,” Ian Frazier writes in his book “Great Plains,” “because he remained himself from the moment of his birth to the moment he died; because he knew exactly where he wanted to live, and never left; because he may have surrendered, but he was never defeated in battle; because, although he was killed, even the Army admitted he was never captured; because he was so free that he didn’t know what a jail looked like.” His “dislike of the oncoming civilization was prophetic,” Frazier writes. “He never met the President” and “never rode on a train, slept in a boarding house, ate at a table.” And “unlike many people all over the world, when he met white men he was not diminished by the encounter.”

Crazy Horse was bayoneted to death on Sept. 5, 1877, after being tricked into walking toward the jail at Fort Robinson in Nebraska. The moment he understood the trap he pulled out a knife and fought back. Gen. Phil Sheridan had intended to ship Crazy Horse to the Dry Tortugas, a group of small islands in the Gulf of Mexico, where a U.S. Army garrison ran a prison with cells dug out of the coral. Crazy Horse, even when dying, refused to lie on the white man’s cot. He insisted on being placed on the floor. Armed soldiers stood by until he died. And when he breathed his last, Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse’s seven-foot-tall Miniconjou friend, pointed to the blanket that covered the chief’s body and said, “This is the lodge of Crazy Horse.” His grieving parents buried Crazy Horse in an undisclosed location. Legend says that his bones turned to rocks and his joints to flint. His ferocity of spirit remains a guiding light for all who seek lives of defiance."
“There is no fish in the ocean”: The future has arrived in this Indian fishing village,https://qz.com/india/1804562/for-indias-karnataka-fishermen-climate-changes-just-barren-sea/amp/,"Every industry can be part of the solution — or part of the ongoing problem.

Jan. 18, 2020. It is a hot Saturday afternoon in Sasihithlu, a small fishing village in southern Karnataka. At 12:30pm, the sun is directly above us, glaring through a largely cloudless sky.

Surya Salian, 62, gathers his cast net for a final throw. He enters the still blue water until it is waist-high. He swings his arm and throws the circular net. It forms a shimmering translucent circle in the air for a few seconds, then drops into the water. After a few minutes, he pulls it out. It has one small fish, a silver biddy, wriggling. He throws it on the white sand, next to three other fish caught a short while ago.

“This might be the year of famine for us,” he said, after a moment.

Supriya Vohra Surya Sailan waiting after casting his net.

Jan. 19, 2020. It is balmy and breezy at 4am in the Arabian Sea. A purse seiner, a big boat that goes out about 15 nautical miles into the ocean to catch Indian oil sardines, is ready to head out. Most of the crew on the ship is from Odisha, Jharkhand, and Andhra Pradesh. They left because their land did not offer them a living, and they arrived here, on the west coast, in south Karnataka, working on big fishing boats, hoping for a better life. After six hours, the ship returns, empty-handed. The crew members earn nothing for the day.

Since August 2019, fishers across the spectrum, from the small-scale ones to owners of giant trawlers, echo a similar lament. There are no fish in the ocean. Although the official fish catch data for 2019-20 will be released only after March 2020, officials from Central Marine Fisheries of India (CMFRI) have confirmed that there has been a significant decline in fish catch since the post-monsoon season.

“Usually, the post-monsoon period is peak fishing time. There is some cause of concern that the peak season did not do well,” said Sunil Mohamed, principal scientist and head, Molluscan Fisheries Division, CMFRI, over a telephone conversation.

There has been a decline in coastal marine fish production in India over the last few years. CMFRI data reveals a 9% decline in overall fish catch in 2018 compared to the previous year. The 2018 annual fish landing data from the institute also showed a 54% decline since 2017 of the Indian oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps), a pelagic fish found abundantly in the Arabian Sea, particularly the coastal waters that cover Karnataka.

Supriya Vohra Eyes peeled for Indian oil sardine on the crow’s nest in a purse seiner.

“We have seen a major decline in the Indian Oil sardine since 2016,” said Mohamed. “For a long time, it formed 30-40% of fish catch. It reduced to 15%, and now barely makes it to 5%,” he said.

Why the decline in fish catch?

Experts have given a variety of reasons for the decline of fish catch.

There’s climate change, the rise in sea surface temperature is changing the nature of oceans, which in turn affects the phytoplankton production, a primary food for several pelagic fish in the ocean, including Indian oil sardines. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change released a report last year stating that there will be an unprecedented rise in the frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea due to anthropogenic warming of the oceans.

Secondly, there are unsustainable methods of fishing. Bull (or pair) trawling involves tying a net between two mechanised boats and dragging the net for several kilometres. It sweeps the ocean bed completely, taking everything with it. Light fishing involves attaching powerful LED lights at the end of nets, dropping it in the water to attract shoals of fish and catching large spawning adults. While bull trawling has been banned by the Karnataka state government since December 2016, LED light fishing has been widely criticised in both Karnataka and Goa, and banned in Goa. However, state officials and trawlers themselves admit that the ban has not had much of an effect.

Both bull trawling and light fishing are in operation during the fishing season. On January 19th, this visiting correspondent heard murmurings at the Mangalore Harbour about a trawler named Blue Whale returning after a successful journey of light fishing, with a haul of spearfish and yellow-tailed tuna, worth Rs12 lakh ($16,767.97).

“Yes, illegal fishing is still happening,” said Manjula ShriShenoy, assistant deputy director at the department of fisheries, Mangalore. “In December, we caught two boats. We found generators for light fishing, higher horsepower (HP) (the limit is 350 HP), and mismatching registration certificate RC. We fined them Rs40,000 and Rs65,000 each. But there are more. But we are too short-staffed to do continuous surveillance.”

The fisheries department currently has a 40% occupancy. “Out of 43 seats, we have 25 lying vacant. None of our field officers are from Dakshin Kannada,” she said. “We don’t even know how many boats head out every day, and they come back at 2am, 3am, 4am. We don’t have the staff to monitor all this,” she said.

The Coastal security police and the Indian Coast Guard have a mandate to patrol the territorial and EEZ waters, respectively, for illegal fishing. Both, however, declined to give an official comment.

Overcapacity of boats

In 1986, the Karnataka state government introduced the Karnataka Marine Fishing (Regulation) Act, 1986, in an attempt to regulate the rampant rise of fishing boats. The act requires a license for every boat and gives the state fisheries department the authority to search the vessels. Over the years, several rules have been formed by the state government, capping horsepower of engines, minimum legal size to bring about regulation in fishing.

According to records provided by the fisheries department, there are 1285 trawl boats, 57 purse seine boats, and 1487 mechanised gill nets and other boats registered in south Karnataka. But both department officials and the local trawler association admit that there are more than the registered number of ships. “About 100-125 boats are added every year, many not registered,” said Nithin Kumar, president of Dakshin Kannada Trawler Association.

“Even with registration, one doesn’t even need to be a fisherman to have a boat,” he scoffed.

Amidst all this, the traditional, small scale, artisanal fisherfolk suffer the most.

The “original” fishers

“Madam, please make sure you emphasise on the word moola. It means “original,” and we are all the original fishermen of Dakshin Kannada,” said Chandrasekhar Shriyan as I jot down the name of their newly formed union. It is called Dakshin Kannada Karavali Moola Meenugarara Sangha, translated to South Karnataka Coastal Original Fishermen Union.

The union, with 1200 members covering 14 villages across the coast of south Karnataka, was formed on Dec. 26, 2019, as a result of growing discontent amongst small scale fish workers of the region.

“We are the Mogaveera, the original tribe of fishermen, born to protect the seashore,” explained Shriyan. “And we are being pushed to the brink of desperation. There is nothing in the sea for us. The capitalists are taking everything.”

“And the government is not helping,” he added.

No fish no money no security

Sharath Kumar, 38, has been fishing since he was 11 years old. He doesn’t own a boat but works on other people’s boats. “I do everything–gill netting, traditional, purse seining, trawl…anything you ask for I’ll do.” But he has not been successful since Dec. 26. “There is no fish in the sea, and if there is no fish, we don’t earn anything for the day,” he said. “I just play rummy all day. Thinking of running away,” he said with a laugh.

Venkatesh, 42, owns two boats–a motorised craft with an outboard engine of 15HP, which is kept by the beach, and a non-motorised traditional canoe, which he takes into the river. When there is nothing in the sea, he takes his traditional craft on the river and hunts for clams. When there is nothing in either, he jumps on a trawl boat. On a trawl boat, for every lakh worth of fish caught, he receives Rs1,000. But the season since August has been bad.

“We haven’t gotten anything in the sea since Dec. 26,” he said, echoing several others. “My monthly expense is at least Rs5000. I need to meet that to keep going.”

Shirish Kerkura has similar sentiments. “You know, earlier we used to get a lot of fish, but not great money,” said the 40-year-old fisherman. “Today, the catch is less, but the fish price is higher. We catch fish once a week and the money gets adjusted for the rest of the days. We roll with it.”

“But it has been awful since late December. They need to do something.”

“A fisherman’s income entirely depends on the catch of the day,” said Shobendra Sashithlu, president of Sasihithlu Fishing Cooperative Society. In existence since 1932, the cooperative currently has 464 active members from the village. At least 150 of them have taken loans from the cooperative, for education, health matters, marriage, life things, said Sasihithlu. “And at least 25 have been unable to return the money.”

“Macchi nahi hai paani mein (There is no fish in the ocean)”, he said in frustration.

Support for women fisherfolk

Remela M Mendela, 65, sells fish for a living. On Jan. 17, Friday, she woke up at 3:30am , made a cup of tea. She collected her baskets that she had made ready the night before. With four fellow fish sellers, she climbed onto a tempo they had taken on hire. She reached Malpe harbour, nearly 50 km away at 4:30am. She bought fish worth Rs21,000. She then headed to another market place about 20 km away by 9:30am, sold all her fish, and returned home by 8:30pm.

Her net earnings: zero.

“Whatever I earned was spent on travel and food for the day,” she said.

In 2015, a subsidy was introduced for women, providing them with fish baskets, insulated iceboxes and stools to sit on. “That was a good subsidy, but it lasted only a year,” said ShriShenoy. “They should bring it back.”

But apart from this, there hasn’t been much support for women fisherfolk. They have to buy their gear, pay their own fare for transport, and sometimes work in dilapidated conditions to get by.

According to a report by The Hindu, in 2012, the National Fisheries Development Board and the Karnataka state government proposed the construction of “ten modern fish markets for women” in the three districts of coastal Karnataka, intending to boost a marketplace for small scale fish workers.

We visited the market structure in Padubidri, another fishing village in south Karnataka. Women fish sellers dominate the market. It was sanctioned at an estimated cost of 76.92 lakhs, with 90% funding from the central government (National Fisheries Development Board) and 10% from the state government (Karnataka State Fisheries Department). The property belongs to the panchayat, who has hired a contractor for four lakhs for nine months, who runs the show.

Fishers from neighbouring villages come in the morning and display their fish ready for auction, giving a minimum selling price. The women then begin the auction. They buy the fish and then proceed to sell it either in the market itself or carry it in their basket to a bigger market or walk for door-to-door delivery.

Tulsi Kotiyan, 42, bought 25-30kg of fish worth Rs5500. She is hoping to sell the fish in the morning hours itself. One of her fears is that if she purchases the fish at a high price, and if the same fish is caught in the sea by the big boats, then the value of her fish goes down.

She is one of the 25-30 women who sit at the market to sell the fish. She has to pay Rs20 per day to sit at her designated area. She received an insulated icebox from the state government. She gets her own plastic baskets.

She said the cleaning is not good, the water is stagnant, and the toilet facilities are terrible. The place, while an essential marketplace for small scale fish workers, could do with better management

Support for the elderly fish workers

A few weeks ago, Salian went out to sea on his boat. A big wave surged towards him, and he toppled over, hurting his rib cage. The nearest government hospital was 20 km from his village. “I had to spend Rs8,000 for my treatment at a private hospital,” he said.

Chandravati, 63, used to sell fish. But over the last few years, arthritis has gripped her. Her husband, Chandaya Mandan, 75, has not gone fishing for the last five years. They both receive Rs1,000 per month under the Sandhya Suraksha Pension Scheme, a state government endeavour for the senior citizens of Karnataka. “But it is not enough,” said Chandravati. “All our money goes towards medical expenses.”

"Climate Denial Spreads on Facebook as Scientists Face Restrictions. The company recently overruled its scientific fact-checking group, which had flagged information as misleading",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-denial-spreads-on-facebook-as-scientists-face-restrictions/,"A climate scientist says Facebook is restricting her ability to share research and fact-check posts containing climate misinformation.

Those constraints are occuring as groups that reject climate science increasingly use the platform to promote misleading theories about global warming.

The groups are using Facebook to mischaracterize mainstream research by claiming that reduced consumption of fossil fuels won’t help address climate change. Some say the planet and people are benefitting from the rising volume of carbon dioxide that’s being released into the atmosphere.

Facebook is an effective way to expand their reach to larger audiences, say members of the groups, which have traditionally been tied to conservative media outlets. In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people have been exposed to misleading and false claims about rising temperatures, according to an E&E News analysis.

Now, Facebook appears to be weakening a firewall it has built to fact-check such climate denialism. The company recently overruled a fact-check from a group of climate scientists, in a move that concerns researchers about a potentially new precedent by the platform that permits inaccurate claims to be promoted if they’re labeled as opinions.

At the same time, Facebook has placed restrictions on one of the country’s most visible climate scientists, Katharine Hayhoe, of Texas Tech University and a lead author of the Fourth National Climate Assessment. She has been blocked from promoting videos related to climate research, a move that has limited her efforts to refute false claims.

Facebook has previously identified Hayhoe’s educational climate videos as “political.” As a result, they are categorized by the platform as a social issue that requires Hayhoe to register them by in part providing personal information that she fears could expose her to personal attacks.

Hayhoe said Facebook is a valuable platform for reaching people outside of partisan boundaries. She said it’s where she is connected to friends and family, former college roommates, and other people who might be skeptical about climate change.

It’s a way to share science with them that doesn’t feel like a political attack, she said. Placing her work on the same level as groups that seek to confuse the public about climate science gives climate denial organizations equal footing that’s unwarranted, she said.

“What I share on Facebook is explicitly for the purpose of people feeling comfortable sharing it with their family, information on positive hopeful solutions, information on unexpected messengers from faith groups, the military, conservative spokespeople,” Hayhoe said. “Facebook is a place where people are connected across tribal lines in a way they aren’t connected from other platforms.”

A sampling of recent posts from groups that reject climate science reveal their use of misleading claims to reach tens of thousands of followers, who often reshare the content with their own contacts.

They include groups that have received funding from the fossil fuel industry as well as foundations that oppose environmental regulations. Some of them have worked to confuse the public about the scientific consensus around climate change.

The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow is one of these groups. It has used Facebook to claim that burning more fossil fuels will help ocean life.

Scientists long ago determined that human-caused climate change was harming sea life by acidifying the ocean, which absorbs about a quarter of the CO 2 pollution and 90% of excess heat caused by global warming.

In one post, the group wrote “our Oceans, all of them, are benefitting enormously by the increase in carbon dioxide which man’s industrialization has produced. The global warming scaremongers have falsely preached that additional carbon dioxide could lower the pH of the oceans to where they become acidic, killing off ocean life.”

The Heartland Institute, which has received funding from fossil fuels companies and foundations opposed to regulations, also made questionable claims.

“If you believe that sea level rise is a massive problem, you’ve bought into the corporate media’s alarmist narrative,” the group claimed, linking to a video making a series of false climate claims that are in opposition to the world’s major science agencies. Sea-level rise has accelerated in the last century and could rise by 3 feet or more in some regions within the next 80 years, scientists say.

‘A million dead’

Heartland has taken advantage of Facebook’s permissible system, spending almost $20,000 in recent years to promote dozens of posts that inaccurately describe the Green New Deal and promote coal-fired power plants. In one post, Heartland attempts to diminish people’s role in causing global warming.

“Manmade climate crisis promoters reject inconvenient evidence of natural climate change. They’re the real deniers,” it said.

The Texas Public Policy Foundation, which has a number of former employees working in senior positions across the Trump administration, recently posted that banning fossil fuels wouldn’t stop climate change. In another post, the group claimed that Democratic climate policies carry mortal risks.

“Had the Green New Deal been enacted 20 years ago, we might have been looking at a million dead from COVID due to mass transit use,” the group wrote.

E&E News previously reported that Facebook intervened to reverse a fact-check that prevented a group—which claims that human-caused carbon dioxide is beneficial—from advertising on the site. By labeling the false claim as “opinion,"" Facebook permitted the group, named the CO 2 Coalition, to resume promoting misinformation (Climatewire, June 23).

The claim in question, posted last year, was taken from an editorial in the conservative Washington Examiner in which two members of the CO 2 Coalition argued that climate models were overblown. The assertion was not supported by consensus, peer-reviewed climate science.

In response, a group of scientists with Climate Feedback—a part of Facebook’s approved fact-checking network—evaluated the post and found that it relied on “cherry-picked” evidence and was misleading. It was marked as “false.”

But weeks later that label was quietly removed. Officials with the CO 2 Coalition said they were helped by a “conservative contact” at Facebook whose intervention resulted in getting the decision reversed.

Facebook is now in a position where it has to explain why it allowed its fact-check to be rolled back, said Brendan Nyhan, a political science professor at Dartmouth College who has studied the effectiveness of fact-checking.

Among the questions the decision raises is whether the reversal signals a broad change of policy or a unique episode, he said. Nyhan also said the company needs to ascertain whether the reversal created a loophole in its fact-checking initiative.

“Facebook needs to articulate clear standards for its fact-checking and define and justify any exceptions to those policies,” Nyhan said. “If fact-checkers are not the ones making determinations about content on the platform, the public and Facebook users have the right to know.”

Facebook’s explanation for its fact-check of the CO 2 Coalition is disputed by groups on both sides.

Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said Science Feedback made the decision to roll back the fact-check. He said opinion pieces are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as scientific posts. He said Science Feedback, not Facebook, made the decision to reverse the “false” label.

“Opinion is separate and apart; there is an opinion rating but it is separate and apart from false or true, or partly false or partly true,” Stone said.

Both the CO 2 Coalition and Science Feedback said Facebook made the decision to pull back the fact-check because it was an opinion piece.

“The Facebook team informed us that it should not be subject to a fact check and we should remove the rating,” said Scott Johnson of the Science Feedback network, which includes Climate Feedback, in an email.

On Wednesday, a coalition of environmental and political groups wrote a letter to Facebook’s oversight board asking the company to crack down on climate denial and to close the opinion loophole that allows climate misinformation to be posted on the platform (Climatewire, July 1).

Facebook’s rollback of an accurate fact-check came several years after it imposed restrictions on Hayhoe, a lead author of the Fourth National Climate Assessment who has a verified Facebook page with about 40,000 followers.

She has used the platform to educate the public about climate science for more than a decade. Two years after Trump’s election, Facebook developed restrictions on her ability to promote her posts and videos about climate change, even though some of them have been peer-reviewed by NOAA.

It started in 2018, Hayhoe said, when she was abruptly blocked from promoting a video in which she explained the climate benefits of clean energy on her Facebook page. A few weeks later, she was blocked from promoting a video that explained climate science for a general audience. The company told her that she had to be a “registered political organization.”

The rules changed again after 2018.

Facebook revised its policy and considers climate change to be in the “environmental politics” advertising category. Users who want to pay to promote their pages, so they are seen by larger audiences, are no longer required to register as a political organization. But they must register using their legal name, social security number, and other information from their passport or driver’s license.

That could expose scientists, especially women, to harassment, said Hayhoe, who has been threatened online. One critic recently sent her pornographic videos.

Hayhoe has declined to comply with Facebook’s requirements for promoting her posts. She says the platform created inappropriate burdens for scientists who want to share objective information about climate change.

“These are the facts,” she said. “These videos have been peer-reviewed, and I still can’t boost them on Facebook.”

"Coke and Pepsi Are Getting Sued for Lying About Recycling. “At this rate, plastic is set to outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050,” the complaint reads.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qjde3p/coke-and-pepsi-are-getting-sued-for-lying-about-recycling,"Coke, Pepsi and several other big plastic polluters are getting sued for lying about their products’ recyclability and clogging up the oceans with millions of tons of waste.

A California-based environmental group, the Earth Island Institute, filed the lawsuit in San Mateo County on Thursday against the companies, arguing that they’ve knowingly polluted the oceans while misleading the public. The lawsuit notes that 8 million to 20 million tons of plastic end up in the world’s oceans every year — and that much of it can be traced back to these few companies.

“At this rate, plastic is set to outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050,” the complaint reads.

The lawsuit calls on these companies to pay to clean up the mess they’ve allegedly made — and to stop labeling their plastic bottles as recyclable. Convincing the public that the solution to plastics pollution is recycling is fundamentally misleading, the complaint argues, because so little plastic actually gets recycled.

Recent studies suggest of the plastic produced since the 1950s, 91% of it hasn’t been recycled. Instead, the scrap winds up in landfills, burned in incinerators, or in the oceans.

But in 2018, China, which used to buy up most of the U.S.’ plastic scrap, passed a ban on most types of plastic imports. Smaller countries have tried to pick up the pace on plastics recycling but haven’t been able to sustain it. It’s likely that less than 5% of plastic produced today is getting recycled, according to an estimate from the Plastic Pollution Coalition. The group projects that the rate will drop further if other countries follow China’s lead and ban plastic scrap imports.

“This is the first lawsuit directly to take on these plastic peddlers who for years have spread the fake narrative that their products can be recycled when they know in many cases this is simply not true,” Josh Floum, president of Earth Island’s board of directors, said in a statement.

Earth Island is taking a page from the lawsuits brought against tobacco companies, claiming that these plastic-producing companies are doing something similar to what cigarette manufacturers did: contributing knowingly to a public harm and lying to the public about it.

“These companies push a product and then create misinformation campaigns so the public isn’t fully aware of the harms of the products when making purchasing decisions,” Sumona Majumdar, general counsel for Earth Island, said in a statement.

The lawsuit is aimed at several of the companies whose packaging was found most often in beach cleanups organized by another environmental group, Break Free from Plastic. Nestlé, Clorox, Crystal Geyser, Mars, and Colgate-Palmolive are among the other companies getting sued.

Some of the companies sued have said they’re already fighting plastics pollution.

“America’s beverage companies are already taking action to address the issue by reducing our use of new plastic, investing to increase the collection of our bottles so they can be remade into new bottles as intended, and collaborating with legislators and third-party experts to achieve meaningful policy resolutions,” a spokesperson for the American Beverage Association, which represents Coke, Pepsi, and others in the non-alcoholic beverage industry, said in a statement sent to the Guardian and Bloomberg Environment.

Correction: This story has been corrected to reflect that the defendants in the case aren't all of the 10 companies identified in the Break Free from Plastics audit, which was just one piece of information used to inform Earth Island's selection of defendants."
"‘They should be allowed to cry’: Ecological disaster taking toll on scientists’ mental health - ‘We’re documenting destruction of world’s most beautiful ecosystems, it’s impossible to be detached’",https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ecological-disaster-mental-health-awareness-day-scientists-climate-change-grief-a9150266.html,"The ecological disaster is taking its toll on scientists’ mental health, with top researchers saying those working in the field must be supported and “allowed to cry”.

Leading researchers have published a letter saying many scientists experience “strong grief responses” to the ecological crisis and there are profound risks of ignoring this emotional trauma.

The letter, published in the journal Science, calls on academic institutions to support scientists and allow them to address their ecological grief professionally.

Professor Andy Radford from the University of Bristol, and co-writer, said: “The emotional burden of this kind of research should not be underestimated. Grief, when unaddressed, can cloud judgement, inhibit creativity and engender a sense that there is no way forward,” he said.

Authors of the letter say environmental scientists often respond to the degradation of the natural world by suppressing or denying painful emissions while at work.

Tim Gordon, lead author of the letter and a marine biologist from the University of Exeter, said: “We’re documenting the destruction of the world’s most beautiful and valuable ecosystems, and it’s impossible to remain emotionally detached.

“When you spend your life studying places like the Great Barrier Reef or the Arctic ice caps, and then watch them bleach into rubble fields or melt into the sea, it hits you really hard.”

Researchers say academic institutions could learn from other professions where distressing events are common, such as in emergency services or the military. In these fields, employees are trained to anticipate and manage emotional distress with training, support and counselling.

Dr Steve Simpson of the University of Exeter, also a co-writer of the letter, said: “Instead of ignoring or suppressing our grief, environmental scientists should be acknowledging, accepting and working through it.

“In doing so, we can use grief to strengthen our resolve and find ways to understand and protect ecosystems that still have a chance of survival in our rapidly changing world.”

The IPCC report has warned that humanity urgently needs to change the way it consumes resources to avoid catastrophic levels of climate warming.

Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events

In 2018, the report warned that we faced major environmental catastrophe within our lifetimes, and potentially as soon as 2040.

Almost 70 per cent of British people want urgent political action, but there is a growing gap between announcements on climate change and the implementation of policies."
"Capitalism is killing the world’s wildlife populations, not humanity",https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/problems/capitalism-is-killing-the-worlds-wildlife-populations-not-humanity-20278,"The latest Living Planet report from the WWF makes for grim reading: a 60% decline in wild animal populations since 1970, collapsing ecosystems, and a distinct possibility that the human species will not be far behind. The report repeatedly stresses that humanity’s consumption is to blame for this mass extinction, and journalists have been quick to amplify the message. The Guardian headline reads “Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations”, while the BBC runs with “Mass wildlife loss caused by human consumption”. No wonder: in the 148-page report, the word “humanity” appears 14 times, and “consumption” an impressive 54 times.

There is one word, however, that fails to make a single appearance: capitalism. It might seem, when 83% of the world’s freshwater ecosystems are collapsing (another horrifying statistic from the report), that this is no time to quibble over semantics. And yet, as the ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer has written, “finding the words is another step in learning to see”.

Although the WWF report comes close to finding the words by identifying culture, economics, and unsustainable production models as the key problems, it fails to name capitalism as the crucial (and often causal) link between these things. It therefore prevents us from seeing the true nature of the problem. If we don’t name it, we can’t tackle it: it’s like aiming at an invisible target.

Why capitalism?

The WWF report is right to highlight “exploding human consumption”, not population growth, as the main cause of mass extinction, and it goes to great lengths to illustrate the link between levels of consumption and biodiversity loss. But it stops short of pointing out that capitalism is what compels such reckless consumption. Capitalism – particularly in its neoliberal form – is an ideology founded on a principle of endless economic growth driven by consumption, a proposition that is simply impossible."

Machines to 'do half of all work tasks by 2025',https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-54622189,"Image copyright Getty Images

Half of all work tasks will be handled by machines by 2025 in a shift likely to worsen inequality, a World Economic Forum report has forecast.

The think tank said a ""robot revolution"" would create 97 million jobs worldwide but destroy almost as many, leaving some communities at risk.

Routine or manual jobs in administration and data processing were most at threat of automation, WEF said.

But it said new jobs would emerge in care, big data and the green economy.

The Forum's research spanned 300 of the world's biggest companies, who between them employ eight million people around the world.

More than 50% of employers surveyed said they expected to speed up the automation of some roles in their companies, while 43% felt they were likely to cut jobs due to technology.

WEF said the pandemic had sped up the adoption of new technologies as firms looked to cut costs and adopt new ways of working. But it warned workers now faced a double threat from ""accelerating automation and the fallout from the Covid-19 recession"".

""[These things have] deepened existing inequalities across labour markets and reversed gains in employment made since the global financial crisis in 2007-2008,"" said Saadia Zahidi, managing director at WEF.

""It's a double disruption scenario that presents another hurdle for workers in this difficult time. The window of opportunity for proactive management of this change is closing fast.""

'Surge in demand'

WEF said currently around a third of all work tasks were handled by machines, with humans doing the rest, but by 2025 the balance would shift.

Roles that relied on human skills such as advising, decision-making, reasoning, communicating and interacting would rise in demand. There would also be a ""surge"" in demand for workers to fill green economy jobs, and new roles in areas like engineering and cloud computing.

But it said millions of routine or manual jobs would be displaced by technology, affecting the lowest paid, lowest skilled workers the most.

It said millions would need to be re-skilled to cope with the change, while governments would have to provide ""stronger safety nets"" for displaced workers."

CEOs quitting in record numbers signal stock market collapse.,https://www.ccn.com/ceos-quitting-in-record-numbers-could-signal-total-stock-market-collapse/,"CEOs are departing in droves.

America’s corporate insiders, which include chief executives, dumped company shares at record levels.

One Wall Street firm is projecting a stagnant year for U.S. companies.

The stock market is in trouble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average printed its worst one-day point drop in history after plunging 1,191 points Thursday. The S&P 500 is also making history. Over the last six days, the index tumbled by 10% from the all-time high at a pace never seen before.

The stock market is cratering and corporate America’s chief executives have been a step ahead of the disaster. Many have been dumping shares prior to the correction. On top of that, top honchos of big U.S. companies are leaving their posts in record numbers. These signs indicate that the longest bull market in history may be over.

Corporate Captains Are Abandoning Ship

Chief executives of top companies in the U.S. are leaving their posts at a pace not seen in nearly two decades. Challenger, Gray, and Christmas reported that 1,480 CEOs departed in 2019. This caught the attention of some analysts as C-level executives don’t often step aside while both the economy and the stock market are booming.

The trend continued in January 2020 with 219 chief executives calling it quits. The number represents the highest CEO departures on a monthly basis since 2008. Are they getting out while the getting is good?

When CEOs vacate their positions while the stock market is trading at record highs, it can be a sign that the business cycle has peaked. Massive insider selling of shares adds weight to this theory.

Financial Times reported that corporate insiders, such as chief executives and chief financial officers, sold an estimated $26 billion worth of shares in 2019. This puts insider selling at the highest level since 2000 when corporate insiders sold $37 billion worth of stock in the midst of the dotcom bubble.

Jeff Bezos alone sold $4 billion worth of Amazon stock in a week. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett has been patiently sitting on a cash pile worth $130 billion. The writings on the wall suggest we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of the longest bull market in history.

Earnings Growth for U.S. Companies Will Be Flat This Year

To add fuel to the fire, one Wall Street firm estimates that 2020 will be a stagnant year for U.S. companies. Goldman Sachs revised its earnings estimates for 2020 to $165 per share from $174 per share. The change represents 0% growth for the year.

The multinational investment bank expects coronavirus to shock both supply and demand in China and the United States. In a note to clients, Goldman equity strategist David Kostin wrote,

We have updated our earnings model to incorporate the likelihood that the virus becomes widespread.

He added,

Our reduced proﬁt forecasts reﬂect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity in 1Q, lower end-demand for US exporters, disruption to the supply chain for many US ﬁrms, a slowdown in US economic activity, and elevated business uncertainty.

Once again, it appears that many chief executives are a step ahead of a disaster. The captains of corporate America are fleeing like rats on a sinking ship while dumping shares in record numbers. The best days of the longest bull market in history may be over.

April 9, 2020

In perhaps the most sobering reminder yet of the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the San Antonio Food Bank aided about 10,000 households Thursday in a record-setting giveaway at a South Side flea market.

“It was a rough one today,” said Food Bank president and CEO Eric Cooper after the largest single-day distribution in the nonprofit’s 40-year history. “We have never executed on as large of a demand as we are now.”

Thursday’s drive-thru at Traders Village was the fourth such event for the Food Bank since March 31.

Over that desperation-filled 10-day span, the agency has fed about 15,500 households, with each distribution drawing more than the first. Cooper said the Food Bank is planning two more giveaways for next week, possibly on Tuesday and Friday, but he’s not sure it can get them done without help from “the National Guard or somebody.”

“Our staff and our volunteers, I don’t know if we can keep up the pace that the demand is requiring,” he said. “We’ve got to debrief and figure things out, but we just can’t feed this many people at one time without probably the Guard or somebody helping us.”

How to Help The San Antonio Food Bank needs volunteers to help prepare food boxes. You can also donate at safoodbank.org/donate.

About 6,000 households preregistered for Thursday’s distribution on the Food Bank’s website, Cooper said. But thousands more showed up, hoping to put something on their tables.

With so many unregistered families coming in beyond what was anticipated, the event didn’t end until nearly 6 p.m., some four hours after its scheduled closing time on a muggy day when temperatures soared into the 90s.

UPDATE: As photos go viral, pressure mounts to help S.A. Food Bank feed thousands

“We tried to qualify people on site,” Cooper said. “There were a few folks who showed up that didn’t qualify…but then there were those who showed up and said, ‘I heard this was happening. I didn’t know I had to register, but I need food. I am a hotel worker and I was laid off.’ Those are the stories we heard from a lot of people who showed up.”

Thursday began with 1 million pounds of food on hand at Traders Village delivered by 25 tractor-trailer rigs. But with so many unexpected thousands and food running out, Cooper made the call to the Food Bank warehouse to send in more trucks loaded with food.

“The fishes and loaves went from 5,000 to 10,000, and there really wasn’t much left over,” Cooper said.

“It was a bit of a miracle that we were able to get done what we got done.”

With the Food Bank requiring preregistration and the distributions held in different parts of town, officials believe there were few repeat recipients.

“It fosters accountability,” Food Bank spokesman Michael Guerra said of the registration process. “We have $1.5 million worth of food here today, so we have to be good stewards of that.”

The majority of vehicles began lining up to enter the parking lot at Traders Village well before dawn for the 10 a.m. kick off, although at least one person arrived at 6 p.m. Wednesday and camped out overnight near the security guard station.

By 6 a.m. Thursday, the parking lot was full, with vehicles neatly lined up to make their way to stations where volunteers packed trunks with bags of beans, canned goods, fresh produce, milk and other supplies.

“It looked like prairie dogs out there, with all the people standing on top of their trucks, trying to get an eagle-eye view of the line to see how much longer they had to wait,” said Brian Billeck, marketing manager at Traders Village.

Billeck became emotional when talking about some of the people he saw in line.

“I saw some of our employees and vendors, and it brought me to tears,” Billeck said.

“It just breaks your heart. It’s not what you want to see.”

Yolanda Benavides, 63, described the aid from the Food Bank as being delivered by “angels from heaven” but admitted she had mixed feelings about receiving aid.

“This hurts because I’ve always given and now we are on the other side,” said Benavides, who is disabled and cares for four grandchildren ages 6 through 17 with her husband, a recently laid off charter-bus driver.

“It would be rice and beans without this,” Benavides said.

The distributions are much-needed, officials say, but are seriously straining the Food Bank’s resources, so much so that Cooper has said he fears its warehouse could be empty in three weeks.

With thousands out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic restrictions, demand at the Food Bank is off the charts.

On the supply side, it has been more difficult for it to gather food because grocery stores have less surplus to donate due to panic buying depleting the shelves day after day. Restaurants who regularly donated food are now closed, shutting off yet another usually reliable Food Bank source.

To bridge the gap, the Food Bank is seeking $12 million worth of help from the state, filing a State of Texas Assistance Request with the Department of Emergency Management last week.

Still, Cooper said, the goal is to give families “the biggest grocery basket possible by way of their trunk” at the drive-thru distributions.

“We are now at a level where we are having to buy food, and dollars are going very quickly,” Cooper said. “The $12 million from the state will help us stock our shelves with peanut butter and soups and chili and stew and rice and beans and corn and green beans and all of those staple items families need in their pantry to nourish their family.”

About 400 volunteers, aided by traffic control performed by San Antonio police, helped distribute the food Thursday.

“The good Lord says help they neighbor,” said C.J. Littlefield, an 80-year-old senior citizens coordinator at the Ella Austin Community Center, in explaining what motivated him to volunteer.

“I wanted to get in the game, stay in the game, stay engaged. That’s what it’s all about.”

Heather Martinez, 30, also cited her faith as the main reason why she volunteered.

“I want to share God’s love with the whole world,” said Martinez, a housekeeper at Community Bible Church.

While handing out containers of milk, Martinez enthusiastically greeted the occupants of each car with uplifting words.

“Hi, how are you?” she cheerily said to one carload. “You have a phenomenal Easter. God bless you all, and please tell me if there is anything I can say for you in my prayers.”

Today's Paper"
Oceans are warming at the same rate as if five Hiroshima bombs were dropped in every second,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/world/climate-change-oceans-heat-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The world's oceans are now heating at the same rate as if five Hiroshima atomic bombs were dropped into the water every second, scientists have said.

An international team of 14 scientists examined data going back to the 1950s, looking at temperatures from the ocean surface to 2,000 meters deep. The study, which was published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences , also showed that the oceans are warming at an increasing speed.

While the past decade has been the warmest on record for global ocean temperatures, the hottest five years ever recorded all came in the last five.

""The upward trend is relentless, and so we can say with confidence that most of the warming is man-made climate change,"" said Kevin Trenberth, distinguished senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

The study shows that while the oceans warmed steadily between 1955 and 1986, warming has accelerated rapidly in the last few decades. Between 1987-2019, ocean warming was 450% greater than during the earlier time period.

Lijing Cheng, the paper's lead author and an associate professor at the International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the ocean temperature was 0.075 degrees Celsius above the 1981-2010 average in 2019.

""There are no reasonable alternatives aside from the human emissions of heat trapping gases to explain this heating,"" Cheng said, adding that to reach this temperature, the ocean would have taken in 228,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 -- or 228 sextillion -- joules of heat.

""The Hiroshima atom-bomb exploded with an energy of about 63,000,000,000,000 Joules,"" Cheng said. ""I did a calculation ... the amount of heat we have put in the world's oceans in the past 25 years equals to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions,"" he added.

That's equivalent to dropping roughly four Hiroshima bombs into the oceans every second over the past quarter of a century. But because the warming is speeding up, the rate at which we are dropping these imaginary bombs is getting faster than ever.

""We are now at five to six Hiroshima bombs of heat each second,"" said John Abraham, one of the authors of the study and a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

Some parts of the Maldives are believed to have lost up to 90% of corals because of changing conditions, including rising temperature.

Oceans serve as a good indicator of the real impact of climate change. Covering almost three quarters of Earth's surface, they absorb the vast majority of the world's heat. Since 1970, more than 90% of the planet's excess heat went into the oceans , while less than 4% was absorbed by the atmosphere and the land, the study said.

But just because people live on land doesn't mean they are immune from the effects of the warming waters. Ocean warming has a profound impact on the entire world.

""If you want to understand global warming, you have to measure ocean warming,"" Abraham said.

For instance, both Hurricane Harvey , which killed at least 68 people in 2017, and Hurricane Florence , whose torrential rains flooded large parts of the US East Coast, were influenced by abnormally high temperatures.

While scientists say man-made climate change isn't solely to blame for tropical storms, studies have shown that higher temperatures can make them wetter and more damaging

Rising temperatures also mean ocean waters have less oxygen and are becoming more acidic, which has a major impact on nutrients that feed marine wildlife . For example, when an ocean heat wave struck the waters of Western Australia in 2011, scientists noticed there were fewer dolphin births and the animal's survival rate dropped.

The warming is also changing currents and altering weather systems at a speed wildlife cannot keep up with.

""It is critical to understand how fast things are changing,"" Abraham added.

The scientists said that while the damage done to the oceans is in many ways irreversible, there is hope for the future.

""We will see continuous increase in ocean heat content in this century even if we can keep the global mean surface temperature (rise) well below 2 degrees Celsius (the goal of the Paris Agreement),"" Cheng said.

However, he added that the speed of warming is entirely dependent on the world's actions on climate change.

""If we can reduce emissions, we can reduce the warming level, and then reduce the associated risks and loses,"" he said.

Trenberth added that an increasing price on carbon would help limit the warming.

""If the leaders of the world changed course, a revolution could take place over about 15 years ... this requires the leaders of China, and the US in particular, along with Europe, to take a strong leadership role and set the stage for the rest of the world to follow,"" he said."
"Oil drops more than 5%, breaking below $46 as collapse continues",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/27/oil-drops-nearly-4percent-breaking-below-47-as-collapse-continues.html,"Oil prices continued their steep decline on Thursday, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude falling more than 5% at the low to $45.88 per barrel — a price not seen since Jan. 2019 — as fears of the coronavirus outbreak, and what it could mean for crude demand, continue to batter prices.

""Current forecasts of crude oil demand have fallen off a cliff. As China is the largest consumer in the world, the unclear impact of the coronavirus is driving WTI lower and lower,"" KKM Financial founder and CEO Jeff Kilburg said to CNBC. ""As China is the largest consumer in the world, the unclear impact of the Corona virus is driving WTI lower and lower,"" he added.

After falling more than 5% in early trading, U.S. West Texas Intermediate pared some of its losses to settle 3.37%, or $1.64, lower, a level not seen since Jan. 2019. WTI posted its fifth straight session of losses, and tumbled even deeper into bear market territory, currently sitting 29% below its 52-week intraday high level of $66.60, reached last April.

International benchmark Brent crude fell to $50.97 per barrel, its lowest level since Dec. 2018, before paring some of the losses to settle 2.34% lower at $52.18 per barrel.

As the number of coronavirus cases outside of China rises, GRZ Energy founder Anthony Grisanti said it remains to be seen how much crude demand will be impacted. ""Demand for oil was weak before all this started because of the China trade war, and I would expect this to continue,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""The Exchange."" ""There's nothing in the horizon that says this is going to improve anytime soon."""
"""Due to modern agribusiness techniques, so much topsoil is washing away that England has only about 60 more harvests left.""",https://www.asiaglobalonline.hku.hk/anthropocene-climate-change/,"Beyond climate change, there’s the Anthropocene. Humans have altered the planet to such an extent that it has entered a new age. The Anthropocene and the unprecedented changes it brings call for a new way to think about how humans relate to the planet.

“Anthropocene” is a widely proposed name for the geological epoch that covers human impact on our planet. But it is not synonymous with ""climate change,"" nor can it covered by ""environmental problems."" Bigger and more shocking, the Anthropocene encapsulates the evidence that human pressures became so profound around the middle of the 20th century that we blew a planetary gasket. Hello, new Earth System. Hello, Anthropocene.

The phrase ""Earth System"" refers to the entirety of our planet's interacting physical, chemical, biological, and human processes. Enabled by new data-collecting technologies like satellites and ever more powerful computer modeling, Earth System science reframes how we understand our planet. Climate is just one element of this system; if we focus on that alone, we will misunderstand the complexity of the danger. The term “environment” helps us understand ourselves as part of ecosystems, but fails to capture the newness of our current situation. We have always lived in the environment; only very recently, just as Asia began its skyrocketing development, did we begin living in the altered Earth System of the Anthropocene.

The Anthropocene Requires a New Way of Thinking

The Anthropocene is a multidimensional challenge. Our future is more unpredictable than ever, with new phenomena like Category 5 megastorms, rapid species extinction, and the loss of polar ice. This change is irreversible. NASA says that levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) are higher than they have been at any time in the past 400,000 years—well before our species evolved—causing the atmosphere to warm.

The climate has certainly changed, but so too have other aspects of the planetary system. Take the lithosphere: 193,000 human-made ""inorganic crystalline compounds,"" or what you and I might call ""rocks,"" now vastly outnumber Earth’s ~5000 natural minerals, while 8.3 billion tons of plastics coat the land, water, and our internal organs. Due to modern agribusiness techniques, so much topsoil is washing away that England has only about 60 more harvests left.

The biosphere is equally altered. Never has the planet been so crowded with human beings. In 1900, there were around 1.5 billion of us; in the 1960s, around 3 billion; today there are upwards of 7.4 billion. Human beings and our domesticated animals comprise an astounding 97% of the total zoomass of terrestrial mammals, meaning that wild creatures make up a miserly 3%. Humans and our companion species occupy considerably more than half of the planet's habitable land surface. Concerning the hydrosphere, fresh water renews itself at the rate of about 1% a year, but currently 21 out of 37 of the world's major aquifers are being drawn down faster—in some cases much faster—than they can be replenished.

Due to modern agribusiness techniques, so much topsoil is washing away that England has only about 60 more harvests left.

The planet's chemistry has changed too. Warmer oceans interfere with the production of oxygen by phytoplankton, and some scientists predict that with a rise of 6oC—which could happen as soon as 2100—this oxygen production could cease. Our production of fixed nitrogen is five times higher than it was 60 years ago; in fact, Earth has never had so much fixed nitrogen in its entire ~4.5-billion-year history. Since World War II, synthetic chemical production has increased more than thirtyfold. Of the more than 80,000 new chemicals, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has tested only about 200 for human health risks.

Alarming as each factor is on its own, the concept of the Anthropocene brings all these factors and others together. This is the only way that we can understand Earth as a single reverberating system with feedback loops and tipping points that we can't yet predict.

The Anthropocene's interrelated systematicity presents not a problem, but a multidimensional predicament. A problem might be solved, often with a single technological tool produced by experts in a single field, but a predicament presents a challenging condition requiring resources and ideas of many kinds. We don't solve predicaments; instead, we navigate through them. Collaboration among scientists, policymakers, social scientists, humanists, and community leaders is key to contending with the Anthropocene. Technology is important, but the hardest challenges will be about how to alter our political and economic systems. Even the United Nations’ US$24 million Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) concluded that our current systems are not up to the task: we need ""significant changes in policies, institutions and practices that are not currently under way.""

The Danger of the One-Dimensional Thinking of Climate Change

So, are the techno-optimists, who believe most world problems can be solved by innovation, wrong? The answer to this question is that they are not so much wrong as misguided, addressing a narrow issue in the narrowest terms. Most begin by gesturing toward the totality of environmental problems, but end by focusing on climate change alone. Sometimes climate change is further reduced to CO 2 emissions to the exclusion of all other greenhouse gases, such as methane.

Technology is important, but the hardest challenges will be about how to alter our political and economic systems.

A favorite example of techno-optimists like economist Jeffrey Sachs is substituting wind power for fossil fuels. Like others, he speaks in confident tones about ""decoupling"" economic growth from natural resources, contending that ""growth can continue while pressures on key resources (water, air, land, habitats of other species) and pollution are significantly reduced rather than increased,"" by means of new technologies and market pricing. In short, we can provide for the growing human population (expected to hit 8 billion in 2023) without destroying the ecosystem, without impoverishing future generations, and without bothering to transform our political and economic systems. The status quo is fine if we tighten a few nuts and bolts. Let us look at this techno-optimism from the Anthropocene perspective.

Most offshore wind turbines require rare earth metals sourced from China, which supplies about 90% of the world’s demand and has a monopoly on some elements. Not only are the mines of China's primary production site, the southeastern province of Jiangxi, being rapidly depleted, but such mining entails shocking environmental and social costs. According to investigative journalist Liu Hongqiao, ""Research has found that producing one ton of rare earth ore (in terms of rare earth oxides) produces 200 cubic meters of acidic wastewater. The production of the rare earths needed to meet China’s demand for wind turbines up to 2050 … will result in the release of 80 million cubic meters of wastewater.” Once obtained, this ore must be transported and processed to make turbines. These turbines, once positioned, require maintenance, using more resources. Ultimately, though, they will end up as refuse, more trash on our trash-filled planet. There is nothing dematerialized or carbon-free about wind turbines if we look at the total picture.

Reducing our problem to climate change, then to CO 2 , and finally to measuring emissions only at the point of energy production is a dramatic misrepresentation of our dilemma. An Anthropocene perspective is needed to keep the totality of the predicament in view.

Reducing our problem to climate change, then to CO 2 , and finally to measuring emissions only at the point of energy production is a dramatic misrepresentation of our dilemma.

Slowing climate change is crucial but navigating its challenges is only possible if it is understood as one facet of planetary overshoot. The challenges of our altered, unpredictable Earth System cannot be met by technological tinkering within the very systems that pushed it over the edge in the first place. There's nothing for it but to roll up our sleeves and begin the hard work of transforming our political and economic systems with the aims of decency and resilience."
"Camp Fire survivors are part of the first wave of climate refugees in the United States. They face disease and financial ruin in the richest country in the world during a supposedly ""good"" economy. What happens when millions flee the SE, CA, and the SW when climate change goes nonlinear?",http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-camp-fire-evacuee-desperation-20181115-story.html,"Don Hardin burrowed between blankets in his SUV, and switched on the heater whenever the shivers returned.

Even during the day Thursday, the 81-year-old Camp fire evacuee, who has arthritis, struggled to stay warm. When temperatures dropped near freezing Wednesday night, Hardin popped a sleeping pill.

Nearby, a woman bear-hugged her grandson for body heat and, inside a small green tent, a man had nightmares of his escape from flames — he flashed back to the car he watched drive into the fire, wondering if he could have saved the people inside.

It had been one week since the Camp fire destroyed everything they owned and respite still seemed out of sight. In a region that was facing a housing shortage even before the fire, some survivors were forced to seek refuge in a tent city outside a Walmart in Chico. For others, evacuation centers established outside the burn zone have become breeding grounds for disease. On Thursday, Butte County health authorities warned that an outbreak of norovirus was spreading with alarming speed, and appeared to have sickened survivors in at least four shelters.

In the days since sheets of flames sprinted through Paradise, killing at least 63 people and decimating the entire town in minutes, evacuees have endured hardship and sorrow in a surreal state of limbo. Some sleep in their trucks to keep warm and swallow tears as they imagine the shells of their homes. Others pray that unanswered texts to missing friends don’t mean what they think they mean, and they feign normalcy for the sake of their children.

“Rain is coming and these people need a shelter over their heads,” said Debby Barbero, a volunteer who has been coordinating donations at the tent settlement.

As a group, the volunteers decided that Sunday at 1 p.m., they would need to shut down the makeshift donation center and tent city and try to help people find shelter in the meantime.

“This is unsustainable right now,” she said, adding that it has been difficult to find shelter space for evacuees.

Matters weren’t much better for those who had managed to find space in the evacuation centers.

By Thursday, an outbreak of the highly contagious norovirus had spread to several shelters. At the evacuation locations, 145 people had come down with vomiting or diarrhea, said Lisa Almaguer, the public information officer for the Butte County Department of Public Health. Twenty-five people had been hospitalized, she said.

“The number of sick people is increasing every day,” Almaguer said.

Outside Walmart on Wednesday, volunteers weaved through tents, handing out homemade muffins and warm towels, which people used to clean their faces. A man who had just spent $30 inside the store offered toiletries and kept his eyes peeled for the perfect family.

“Anybody got a couple boys?” he asked, holding a pack of Hot Wheels toy cars. “I’m hoping I can put a smile on your kids’ faces.”

Nearby, DeAnn Miller propped herself up on her maroon walker. The cold temperatures helping firefighters aggravated her arthritis, she said, so it had been a long, familiar night.

Miller, 57, who goes by Dee, lived on the streets of Chico for a year and a half until May, when her Uncle Joe gave her a 16-foot travel trailer, which she parked in nearby Magalia. She hasn’t been able to get a hold of her uncle or check on her trailer, Miller said, and she evacuated so quickly that she took nothing with her, not even a change of clothes.

“To just get a home again and to lose it like this …” she said, trailing off and assuming the worst. “I don’t want to be homeless again.”

A few feet away, Karen Kaksonen pulled out her cellphone and stared at a picture of her 800-square-foot home reduced to ash. All that remained was a brick chimney. The 33-year-old, who had lived in Paradise for more than half of her life, thought back to the 2008 fire and how her home perched high on a mountain always seemed to escape the flames. The firefighters, she remembered telling her grandmother, would “never let the fire get this high.”

For a few nights, Kaksonen and her boyfriend stayed at a hotel, but when the reservation ended they searched for other spots. Everything was sold out, so they headed to the Walmart in Chico and pitched a tent. When it got really cold, Kaksonen, her boyfriend, her mother and her mother’s fiance all crammed into one tent, relying on one another’s body heat.

For some, a semblance of routine offered solace in the face of loss.

Before 9 a.m. Thursday on the other side of town, the girls’ basketball team from Paradise High School trickled into their rival’s gym in Chico for their first practice since losing their hometown a week earlier.

Out of 15 girls and two coaches, only one had a home that was still standing.

The Bobcats’ varsity coach, Sheila Craft, locked eyes with her Chico High counterpart, Gina Snider, and the two women hugged.

“We don’t know what school’s going to look like,” said Craft, who lost her home. “But we’re sure going to try to have a season.”

The sound of the basketballs echoed in the gym as girls dribbled down the shiny wooden court. Nets swished and the girls let out happy cries, forgetting, at least for a moment, the swirling ash and salmon-colored disc of a smoke-tinged sun outside.

Tessa Lawrie, whose 15-year-old daughter sprinted up the court, explained her family’s situation to her daughter’s junior varsity coach. They’d lost their home in Paradise, Lawrie said, so they were staying at a cousin’s home in Chico along with Lawrie’s mother and stepfather, who also lost their home.

“One big, happy family having a slumber party,” she said, adding that they also had three cats, two dogs, a hamster and a rabbit in the home. The fish tank, she said, didn’t make it out.

“We have to keep smiling and going through the motions,” she said, for the sake of her children. “They need some sort of normalcy right now. Their whole world has been turned upside down.”

When Paradise High athletic director Anne Stearns arrived, she spoke about survivor’s guilt. Her home in Chico had survived, as had the home of a volleyball player she knew. The girl still had a home, Stearns said, and she felt terrible about it.

When Craft, the varsity coach, called a team huddle, the girls sat on the edge of the court, faces raised.

“We will have a basketball team,” Craft assured them, explaining that their first game would be up north in Susanville on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.

“We will have games as long as everybody is wanting to stay and play. Parents, don’t worry about transportation. We have so many teachers who don’t have work. They’ll drive you.”

She talked about logistics, when practices would be held, how to get information and transportation and clothes.

Every game this season will be an away game. Even if it’s supposed to be a home game. Paradise High is still standing. But there’s not much else left in the town of 26,000 or so.

Still.

“The season is not about winning anything, doing anything great,” Craft said. “It’s about us staying together. We can’t lose a whole season of learning.”

She teared up.

Rheann Colwell, a 16-year-old junior, came to practice in black jeans, a black T-shirt and sandals. Her home in Paradise is a pile of ash. What clothes she could grab before evacuating were in Weaverville, at her grandparents’ house.

She raised her hand at the end of the meeting. She needed shoes.

Craft kicked off her black slip-ons. They were size 9.5, too big. Snider handed over her red Chuck Taylor All Stars. Size 7.5, too small. Kylee Weinbarger, 15, ran to her bag and returned with another pair of well-worn Chucks.

These were white — well, sort of white — size 8.5, a perfect fit.

Practice began.

"This is why we're doomed. People: ""We want the government to fight climate change!"" Gov: ""sure thing, here's a tax on red meat."" People in this thread: ""No, not like that""",https://www.businessinsider.com/red-meat-could-be-taxed-to-help-curb-climate-change-2019-8,"A new report by Fitch Solutions reveals that a ""sin tax"" currently put on products like sugary drinks and tobacco could soon be applied to meat globally.

Like sugar, red meat has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

This research follows a recent UN report that found that the human food system accounts for 37% of all greenhouse-gas emissions.

Introducing a tax on meat would likely accelerate the recent trend of vegetarian, vegan and ""flexitarian"" diets.

Fitch Solutions claims if taxes were as successful at constraining the global appetite for meat, the reduction in carbon emissions could be enormous.

First the taxman came for your cigars, now he might be coming for your steak.

That's according to a new report sent to Business Insider by research company Fitch Solutions, which concluded that ""sin taxes"" – levies on products deemed undesirable like tobacco, sugary foods and drinks – could soon be applied to meat.

""Governments could leverage on this demand for more sustainability and tax the consumer instead of implementing stricter environmental production regulations,"" Fitch first suggested in May.

Since then, new research by the company predicts such a tax could go global, due to environmental, health and ethical concerns.

""The global rise of sugar taxes makes it easy to envisage a similar wave of regulatory measures targeting the meat industry,"" Fitch told Business Insider.

Just last week, a coalition of cross-party German politicians proposed hiking the value-added tax (VAT) on meat from 7% to 19% in the hopes of cutting consumption.

Like sugar, red meat has been linked to an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, which Fitch said laid the groundwork for similar taxes. A study by University of Oxford, for example, found introducing the measure could prevent almost 6,000 deaths a year and save nearly $850 million in healthcare costs.

""A meat tax could, therefore, emerge as a policy sibling to the sugar tax, supported on the basis that meat does play a role in a balanced diet but over-consumption is a public health issue,"" it concluded.

Unlike sugar, however, the justification for restricting people's appetite for meat relates to broader issues than just health, with climate change, deforestation, and ethical concerns all looming large in the minds of consumers.

It comes hot on the heels of a UN report which found that the human food system accounts for 37% of all greenhouse-gas emissions.

The production of meat – and especially red meat – is responsible for much of that. A 2011 study found that lamb, followed by beef, are by far the worst offenders.

These concerns have supported the growing uptake of meat-free diets. Meat alternatives have begun going mainstream, with companies like Beyond Meat enjoying considerable success.

""We are already witnessing consumers cut back on red meat across a number of developed markets globally, supported by the increasing popularity of vegan, vegetarian and 'flexitarian' diets. Younger, urbanised consumers are the main drivers of meat-free diets, suggesting that this will be a long-term trend,"" Fitch said.

""Introducing a tax on meat would likely accelerate this trend, encouraging consumers to moderate consumption of red meat by switching to poultry or plant-based proteins.""

So how far could this spread?

Despite once being considered a fringe policy issue, sugar taxes certainly managed to spread around the world to countries as different as the UK, Mexico and Dubai — where the tax is a whopping 50%.

A meat tax could similarly raise prices to the point where consumption falls. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), taxes that hike the price of sugary drinks by 20%, reduce consumption by around the same amount.

If taxes were as successful at constraining the global appetite for meat, the reduction in carbon emissions could be enormous.

Goldsmiths, University of London announced on Monday that it would stop selling beef in hopes of combatting climate change. The UK's National Farmers Union said the decision to single out one food product as a response to global warming was ""overly simplistic"".

A recent study found that if the United States went meatless, it would be the equivalent of taking 60 million cars off the roads.

However, Fitch tipped cold water on that idea. It stated that it was ""highly unlikely"" that meat-lovers in the US and Brazil would use taxes to banish meat from menus."
"The blood of poor Americans is now a leading export, bigger than corn or soy",https://boingboing.net/2019/12/09/leeched.html,"America is one of the only developed countries in the world that pays people to donate blood, much of it sold abroad (70% of the world's plasma is of US origin), and as commercial blood donations have soared, blood now accounts for 2% of the country's exports — more than corn or soya.

There's more growth ahead for blood products, expected to ""grow radiantly"" according to an analyst who was cheering 13% growth between 2016-17.





One study found that the typical blood-seller derives a third of their income from selling blood. Princeton's Kathryn Edin called the commercial blood industry ""the lifeblood of the $2 a day poor.""

Mintpress's interviews with blood-sellers reveal ""a mix of disabled, working poor, homeless, single parents, and college students,"" who describe a system of arbitrary and predatory payments, which fluxuate wildly from day to day.

Chronic bloodletting produces lethargy and cognitive impairment.



Respondents all agreed that they were indeed being exploited, but in more ways than one. Desperate Americans are allowed to donate twice per week (104 times per year). But losing that much plasma could have serious health consequences, most of which have not been studied Professor Schaefer warns, stressing that more research is necessary. Around 70 percent of donors experience health complications. Donors have a lower protein count in their blood, putting them at greater risk of infections and liver and kidney disorders. Many regulars suffer from near-permanent fatigue and are borderline anemic. All this for an average of $30 per visit. Rachel described the terrible Catch-22 many of the working poor find themselves in:



I got turned away twice – once for being too dehydrated and once for being anemic. Being poor created a shitty paradox where I couldn't eat, and because I couldn't eat my iron levels weren't high enough to allow me to donate. That was a week of a pay cut, money I desperately needed for rent and bills and meds.""

YouGov survey shows 18% of young people in UK do not think life is worth living,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/05/youth-unhappiness-uk-doubles-in-past-10-years,"The number of young people in the UK who say they do not believe that life is worth living has doubled in the last decade, amid a sense of overwhelming pressure from social media which is driving feelings of inadequacy, new research suggests.

In 2009, only 9% of 16-25-year-olds disagreed with the statement that “life is really worth living”, but that has now risen to 18%. More than a quarter also disagree that that their life has a sense of purpose, according to a YouGov survey of 2,162 people for the Prince’s Trust, a charity that helps 11 to 30-year-olds into education, training and work. Youth happiness levels have fallen most sharply over the last decade in respect of relationships with friends and emotional health, the survey found, while satisfaction with issues like money and accommodation have remained steady.

'You will have an emotional reboot': the ultimate guide to stress at every age Read more

The Prince’s Trust has been gauging youth opinion for 10 years and found that just under half of young people who use social media now feel more anxious about their future when they compare themselves to others on sites and apps such as Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. A similar amount agree that social media makes them feel “inadequate”. More than half (57%) think social media creates “overwhelming pressure” to succeed.

The gloomy view on life being taken by a growing minority of young people comes amid reports of an increased rate of teenage suicide. It was reported on Sunday that official statistics due later this year will show that suicides now occur at more than five in 100,000 teenagers in England. That contrasts with a figure of just over three in 100,000 in 2010.

“Social media has become omnipresent in the lives of young people and this research suggests it is exacerbating what is already an uncertain and emotionally turbulent time,” said Nick Stace, UK chief executive of The Prince’s Trust. “Young people are critical to the future success of this country, but they’ll only realise their full potential if they believe in themselves and define success in their own terms. It is therefore a moral and economic imperative that employers, government, charities and wider communities put the needs of young people centre stage.”

There were positive feelings about social media too. A third of people said being on social media makes them feel like they can have a voice for their generation and influence positive change, and more than a quarter said it made them happy. However, playing sport (44%), earning enough money to live how they want (62%) and spending time with family (77%) were more likely to drive happiness. Four out of 10 young people said they felt more confident online than they do in person, but that rises to almost half among the youngest age group, 16 to 18-year-olds.

The findings follow public pressure on the government to toughen the regulation of social media companies, which use algorithms to target users with tailored content. Ministers have asked the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, to draw up advice on social media usage for children amid growing concerns about links between its excessive use and mental health problems among children.

Education secretary Damian Hinds, said at the weekend that social media companies have a “moral duty” to act. He announced that children will have lessons in how to deal with the pressures of social media.

Tskenya Frazer, 24, a habitual Instagram and Twitter user until recently, said she would “feel bad” about her own life when looking at posts from friends about holidays, work promotions, new cars or homes. It also made her question her body image.

“As soon as I woke up I would be on Instagram, scrolling through,” she said. “I would be on a page with a girl with the most perfect body.”

“Social media reinforces those feelings of not being good enough, that you’re too fat, and that is toxic,” Frazer said. “Social media doesn’t induce those feelings but it heightens them.”

The Prince’s Trust creates an index based on happiness and confidence which stood at 73 in 2009. It is now at its lowest level yet at 69.

Sierra Club sues EPA over claim that climate change 'is 50 to 75 years out',https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/465191-sierra-club-sues-epa-to-back-claims-that-climate-change-is-50-to-75,"The Sierra Club sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday after the agency refused to turn over any documents to back up Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEnforcing environmental laws is a key to environmental justice EPA reapproves use of pesticide previously struck down in court OVERNIGHT ENERGY: EPA eases permitting for modifications to polluting facilities | Rocky Mountain National Park closed due to expanding Colorado wildfire | Trump order strips workplace protections from civil servants MORE’s claim that climate change “is 50 to 75 years out.”

The Sierra Club had filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in April asking the EPA to provide all records Wheeler relied on in making that statement, as well as any research from the EPA that supported his claim.

Wheeler’s comments came in an April interview with CBS News, when he said he would be focused on pressing issues like access to clean water since “most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.”

The EPA denied the Sierra Club's FOIA request in June, saying the request “fails to adequately describe the records sought.”

“Your request does not seek specific records but is rather a question framed as a FOlA request,” the agency wrote in a letter to the Sierra Club.

The environmental group then appealed through the FOIA process but never heard back from EPA. The Sierra Club then filed a lawsuit Wednesday in the D.C. District Court.

“They’re essentially arguing that the public does not have a right to know what, if anything, is supporting his claims,” said Matthew Miller, an attorney for the Sierra Club.

“The EPA either needs to admit there is in fact no support for the administrator’s statement and they need to set the record straight that he was misleading and inaccurate,” Miller said. “Or they need to provide us with whatever unknown basis of support they are relying on — which is apparently none — and which would be contrary to the overwhelming scientific consensus and his own agency’s scientists' research.”

An EPA spokesman said in an email Thursday that while the agency would not comment on pending litigation, ""experts from EPA and other organizations like the [United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] regularly measure climate change impacts, including the effects of regulation, in multi-decadal time frames, not year-to-year variations.""

Wheeler’s April statement contradicted numerous government reports which call for a sense of urgency in battling climate change.

Almost all climate scientists have concluded that the effects of human-caused climate change are already taking place.

The FOIA process has previously been used by environmental groups to challenge EPA statements about climate change.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Friday that the world is living “in the shadow of nuclear catastrophe,” fueled by growing distrust and tensions between the nuclear powers.

The U.N. chief told a high-level meeting to commemorate the recent International Day for Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons that progress on ridding the world of nuclear weapons “has stalled and is at risk of backsliding.” And he said strains between countries that possess nuclear weapons “have increased nuclear risks.”

As examples, Guterres has expressed deep concern at the escalating disputes between the Trump administration and China. Relations between the U.S. and Russia are at a low point. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan are feuding over Kashmir, and India just had a border skirmish with China. And North Korea boasts about its nuclear weapons.

Without naming any countries, Guterres said programs to modernize nuclear arsenals “threaten a qualitative nuclear arms race,” not to increase the number of weapons but to make them “faster, stealthier and more accurate.”

Guterres also pointed to the only treaty constraining the size of the world’s largest nuclear arsenals -- the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and Russia -- which is set to expire next year.

“It is imperative” that the two countries extend it without delay for the maximum five years, he said, waring that without a treaty there is an “alarming possibility of a return to unconstrained strategic competition.”

The secretary-general said the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or NPT, which marks its 50th anniversary this year, remains the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

The five-year review of its implementation was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic until next year and Guterres urged its 191 parties to use the extra time to strengthen the treaty, including making “tangible progress towards the elimination of nuclear weapons.”

Guterres said he also looks forward to the entry into force of the first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons, which was adopted in July 2017 by 122 countries. Once it has 50 ratifications, the treaty will enter force in 90 days, and with Malaysia’s ratification on Sept. 30 it now has 46.

At Friday’s high-level meeting, 103 of the 193 U.N. member nations were scheduled to speak for two minutes each. But many spoke longer so only 79 delivered addresses, and the U.N. said it would post the rest.

Of the major nuclear powers, Russia and China were on the speakers list but didn’t get to speak. The United States Britain and France skipped the meeting. So did North Korea and Israel, which is widely reported to have a nuclear arsenal but has never admitted it publicly. India and Pakistan were scheduled to speak, but only India got to deliver remarks.

Many speakers recalled that the meeting took place 75 years after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed 210,000 people and sped the end of World War II.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, whose country is still part of a 2015 agreement with Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany aimed at preventing the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear weapon, said the meeting “provides a unique opportunity to mobilize the world to liberate humanity from the nuclear nightmare.”

In brief prerecorded remarks, Zarif accused the United States of “developing new nuclear weapons and recklessly lowering the threshold of their deployment.” He said the U.S. has also caused “immense damage to the NPT by unlawfully withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and the 1987 intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia on missile.

Zarif also lashed out at U.S. support for Israel, “the sole possessor of nuclear arsenal in our region.” He demanded that the international community “compel Israel -- which has aggression in its very DNA -- to promptly accede to the NPT and destroy its nuclear arsenal” and submit to “the most intrusive inspection regime.”

The Iranian minister also called on the General Assembly “to declare as a binding norm of international law that a nuclear war cannot be won -- and must never be fought,” and to develop a concrete program for “time-bound nuclear disarmament.”

“Just imagine if the billions wasted on instruments of global annihilation were allocated to help fund the fight against COVID-19,” Zarif said.

India’s Foreign Minister Harsh Vardhan Shringla reiterated the country’s longstanding commitment to nuclear disarmament through a step-by-step process, and said all states possessing nuclear weapons need to hold a “meaningful dialogue” to build trust and confidence.

Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in spite of the “catastrophic humanitarian consequences” of the atomic bombings, “the nuclear threat is as present as ever and multilateralism is under severe pressure.”

“Polarization and a lack of trust” are “a dangerous mix, one which we cannot afford to ignore,” she said.

Linde called on the U.S. and Russia to promptly extend New START and welcomed recent discussions “on a broader, follow-on agreement, which could also include China.”

Sweden has launched the Stockholm Initiative on Nuclear Disarmament with 15 non-nuclear nations aimed at building “political support for a result-oriented disarmament agenda within the NPT framework,” she said, urging other countries to join the effort.

Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said “no significant progress” has been made by nuclear weapon states in reducing their arsenals, and their current modernization efforts have resulted in “the ever-enlarging trust deficit among countries.”

She called for enforcement of the NPT, strengthening disarmament, the early entry into force of the nuclear test ban treaty, and for all nuclear weapon states to become parties to nuclear weapons free zones.

“Maintaining nuclear weapons, is clearly, a zero-sum situation, while total abolishment of such weapons, will ensure that humanity prevails,” Marsudi said."
"Australian senator: ""To spell it out for citizens: that is the end of the human race.""",https://nick-mckim.greensmps.org.au/articles/false-equivalence-and-climate-debate,"As we sit here today, we're on track for four to six degrees of global warming by the end of the century.

To spell it out for citizens: that is the end of the human race. I want to speak about the breakdown of our climate, and I want to speak about the existential threat that our collective lack of action poses to humanity.

I also want to respond to some of the tut-tutting that's emerged in this building over the last couple of days, because too many journalists, and too much of the commentariat in this place, have hidden behind the 'both sides' nonsense—that is, the false equivalence of balance—to condemn the Greens for telling the truth about this existential threat that we are facing and for calling for real action on climate change.

It is a false equivalence that is part of the same old school of thinking that has stifled climate policy for well over a decade in this place.

That false equivalence, pedalled by too many journalists and too many members of the commentariat in this building, is exactly what the LNP and the ALP use as cover.

There are not two sides to climate science; there is just the science—but not enough of us are listening to the warnings of the scientists.

What there are two sides to is the political debate about climate in this place. On one side you have the Australian Greens, who've listened to the science and have set their policies accordingly.

On the other side of that political debate are the major parties, who are ignoring the science to benefit their corporate donors and to benefit their post-parliamentary careers.

Every time that anyone in this place pretends there is any kind of moral equivalence between the two, you dumb down the debate and you play into the hands of those who have fed on uncertainty and doubt to lock in their obscene profits, to lock in the personal benefits they are making by destroying the climate and stealing the future off our children and our grandchildren.

There has been commentary recently from some journalists that both sides of the climate debate are over-egging their cases.

Well, I say to those journalists: How the bloody hell do you over-egg four to six degrees of warming? How can you over-egg the fact that people are already dying as a result of climate change?

How can you over-egg a genuine threat to the lives of every single person on the planet? How can you over-egg humanity's extinction? You can't! You can't over-egg those things. It is impossible to be too concerned about those things.

How on earth can you pretend that anything that anyone in the Greens has said this week is more offensive, stupid or damaging than Mr Barnaby Joyce's claim that fluctuations in the sun's magnetic fields are responsible for the bushfires that are currently burning? How on earth can anything that we say be as stupid as that? It can't be.

How on earth can anything we say be more troubling or more stupid than Senator Rennick's claim that the Bureau of Meteorology is altering records for a political agenda? It is impossible to say something more offensive or more silly than that.

How on earth could anything the Greens have said this week be more insensitive than the Prime Minister waving around a lump of coal in this parliament when the country was in the middle of a heatwave? That's where the offence lies in this debate.

It doesn't lie in anything the Greens have said; it lies in the things that Senator Rennick, the Prime Minister and Mr Joyce have said, and it lies in the timid acquiescence of the Labor Party to this government's climate-denying agenda.

Those who seek to silence us are asking us to accept the muting blanket of civility because conflict makes them uncomfortable. Well, here's a newsflash: conflict, at times, is what politics is all about, and right now the forces of darkness are winning.

To those who are offended by some of the strong language used by the Greens and by those brave people who are now taking direct action in our streets to raise their concerns about the lack of action on climate from the major parties, I say we are collectively offended by the death of the Great Barrier Reef; we are collectively offended at this gross act of intergenerational theft that you are perpetrating on our children and our grandchildren through the rape of this planet that you are all supporting; we are offended by the deforestation of Tasmania; and we are offended by the fact that you are collectively cooking and baking this planet for our children to die on.

That is what we are offended about.

There is no opportunity for consensus with the major parties in this place while they still support massive new coalmines like the one proposed by the Adani company.

There is no opportunity for consensus with people who believe in fracking for gas in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

There is no opportunity for consensus with people who still support mining for oil in the Great Australian Bight.

There is no opportunity for consensus with people who still support strip-mining Tasmania's native forests in a direct public subsidy to corporate profits.

There can be no agreement to fix the climate crisis so long as there continues to be a revolving door between parliament and the boardrooms of the big loggers and the big miners and so long as the dirty money flows to the main parties from the major polluters.

If you're worried about a lack of civility, you can stay worried, because this is a time for truth-telling.

This is a time to put all our cards on the table, because the United Nations and the scientific community are telling us we've got a decade to get it right and, if we don't get it right, we are facing disaster

Senator Rennick interjecting—

Senator McKIM: So, while Senator Rennick and anyone else who wants to interject in this debate is calling for civility, I say: if you want civility, get your act together.

Start listening to the science.

Start listening to the warnings from the scientists.

Start listening to your children as they rise up, rightfully demanding stronger action on the climate emergency.

That's how you will get civility into this debate: by telling the truth, by taking the action that science is telling us we need to take and by making sure we help people through the inevitable massive transitions that will need to occur if we're going to avoid causing the extinction of humanity and probably many other species on this planet.

I know that the very, very wealthy are already making their plans for their boltholes, and plenty of them—don't worry—will arrive in my home state of Tasmania over the journey.

But I ask those people, and everyone here, to think about those billions of people in the world wracked by poverty, wracked by climate crisis, who will not have the choices or the opportunities that you have to do your best to look after the lives of your children and your grandchildren.

If you want civility, start acting like you deserve it."
David Attenborough: Collapse of civilisation is on the horizon,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/david-attenborough-collapse-civilisation-on-horizon-un-climate-summit?,"Naturalist tells leaders at UN climate summit that fate of world is in their hands

The collapse of civilisation and the natural world is on the horizon, Sir David Attenborough has told the UN climate change summit in Poland.

The naturalist was chosen to represent the world’s people in addressing delegates of almost 200 nations who are in Katowice to negotiate how to turn pledges made in the 2015 Paris climate deal into reality.

As part of the UN’s people’s seat initiative, messages were gathered from all over the world to inform Attenborough’s address on Monday. “Right now we are facing a manmade disaster of global scale, our greatest threat in thousands of years: climate change,” he said. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.”

“Do you not see what is going on around you?” asks one young man in a video message played as part of a montage to the delegates. “We are already seeing increased impacts of climate change in China,” says a young woman. Another woman, standing outside a building burned down by a wildfire, says: “This used to be my home.”

Attenborough said: “The world’s people have spoken. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now. Leaders of the world, you must lead. The continuation of civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend is in your hands.”

Attenborough urged everyone to use the UN’s new ActNow chatbot, designed to give people the power and knowledge to take personal action against climate change.

Recent studies show the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, and the top four in the past four years. Climate action must be increased fivefold to limit warming to the 1.5C scientists advise, according to the UN.

The COP24 summit was also addressed by António Guterres, the UN secretary general. “Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late,” he said. “For many, people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life or death.”

Guterres said the two-week summit was the most important since Paris and that it must deliver firm funding commitments. “We have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos,” he said.

He highlighted the opportunities of the green economy: “Climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better. Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey.”

Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland, spoke at the opening ceremony, saying the use of “efficient” coal technology was not contradictory to taking climate action. Poland generates 80% of its electricity from coal but has cut its carbon emissions by 30% since 1988 through better energy efficiency.

Friends of the Earth International said the sponsorship of the summit by a Polish coal company “raises the middle finger to the climate”.

A major goal for the Polish government at the summit is to promote a “just transition” for workers in fossil fuel industries into other jobs. “Safeguarding and creating sustainable employment and decent work are crucial to ensure public support for long-term emission reductions,” says a declaration that may be adopted at the summit and is supported by the EU.

In the run-up to the summit, Donald Trump expressed denial about climate change, while there were attacks on the UN process from Brazil’s incoming administration under Jair Bolsonaro.

Ricardo Navarro, of Friends of the Earth in El Salvador, said: “We must build an alternative future based on a just energy transformation. We face the threat of rightwing populist and climate-denying leaders further undermining climate protection and racing to exploit fossil fuels. We must resist.”

Another goal of the summit is for nations to increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions; currently they are on target for a disastrous 3C of warming. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who led the 2017 UN climate summit, said his country had raised its ambitions. He told the summit: “If we can do it, you can do it.”"
"Unemployment rate won't recover for the next decade, CBO projects",https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/02/economy/congressional-budget-office-projections-economy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) America's recovery from the pandemic recession could last through the better part of the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office's 10-year forecast published Thursday.

The Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown has brought the economy to a stop , and even though states are slowly reopening, it will be a tough next decade as the country recovers from this recession, according to the CBO.

On top of that, the forecast is riddled with uncertainty in terms of the virus itself, changes to consumer behavior and policy responses, the CBO cautioned.

The CBO now forecasts the unemployment rate will remain above its pre-pandemic level -- which was a near-50-year low of 3.5% -- until after 2030, the end of the current forecasting range, the CBO predicts. The 10-year average unemployment rate will be 6.1%, up from 4.2% projected in January.

Meanwhile real US gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, will be an average 3.4% lower over the next decade than what was originally predicted in January. It will take until 2028 until GDP will grow in line with long-term trend growth again."
66 percent of Americans now say they've seen enough evidence to justify action on climate change,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/17/americans-want-action-on-climate-change-republicans-are-the-exception-poll.html,"Americans have reached consensus on the need to act in response to climate change with one conspicuous exception: Republicans.

A new NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll identifies that sharp break in the evolving pattern of public opinion as scientists have amplified their warnings of rising global temperatures and linked them to a range of natural disasters. Overall, 66 percent of Americans now say they've seen enough evidence to justify action, up from 51 percent two decades ago.

That figure incorporates 85 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of independents, 71 percent of women, 61 percent of men and strong majorities of all racial groups. At least 55 percent agree on the need for action in all regions of the country, and at all age, education and income levels.

Resistance comes only from the one-third of Americans who identify themselves as Republicans. A 56 percent majority of the GOP says either that concern about climate change is unwarranted or that more research is necessary before taking action.

The survey shows how deeply the Republican rank and file has absorbed the messages from GOP leaders and media outlets that fears about the issue have been either exaggerated or fabricated outright. Republican Congressional leaders opposed decisions by President Clinton and Obama to curb US carbon emissions in concert with action by other nations.

President Trump, who has called climate change a ""hoax,"" last year announced the U.S. would withdrawn from the 2015 Paris Agreement joined by 196 countries. The result makes Republicans stand out among those whose sense of urgency has not budged over 20 years and four different presidents.

In 1999, the NBC/WSJ poll showed that just 15 percent of Republicans believed that climate change had been established as a serious problem requiring an immediate response. Today that proportion remains unchanged at 15 percent, while the share of Democrats and independents who expressed urgent concern has risen sharply.

Opponents of action, including Trump, typically insist the financial costs of curbing climate change exceed potential benefits. But the NBC/WSJ survey shows most Americans now disagree.

A 52 percent majority says that failure to address climate change will cost more through the consequences of weather-related events such as droughts or floods. Just 35 percent say that action will raise energy prices and cost more.

Here, too, opinion breaks sharply by party. Some 63 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of independents say action will cost less than inaction. But just 35 percent of Republicans agree, outpaced by the 48 percent of Republicans who believe action will cost more.

The telephone survey of 900 adults was conducted Dec. 9-12. It carries a margin for error of 3.27 percentage points."
Climate breakdown will make the Mediterranean ‘migrant crisis’ look like a tea party,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/climate-breakdown-mediterranean-migrant-crisis-sea-watch,"Being arrested in the Italian port of Lampedusa drew a lot of media attention on me personally this summer as a young woman and a sea captain whose vessel, the Sea-Watch 3, had rescued 40 people from the Mediterranean and taken them to safety. My arrest came after two weeks at sea attempting to secure a political solution so we could legally land these refugees from the civil war in Libya. My ship entered Italian waters despite an order from Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, so in the media I became the woman who defied the right in Italy and Europe.

I’m still under investigation by the Italian authorities (although a judge overturned my arrest because I was trying to save lives) but am I worried? Honestly, no, because my actions were justified. What I’m really scared of is the damage we are doing to our planet, and the hostility that may be unleashed against those fleeing drought, famine, fires and storms. To me, the dangers of climate breakdown and the need to help those trying to cross the Mediterranean are intimately linked.

A lot of people are understandably worried about discussing the links between migration and the climate crisis, fearing it will lead to more xenophobia and even tougher border policies. The thing is, this xenophobia and these hard border policies are already here. I have seen them with my own eyes, in the people I’ve pulled from the sea – and in those I was too late to save.

Climate breakdown exacerbates the reasons people already have for needing to migrate, such as desperate socioeconomic conditions or political oppression. In situations where people already struggle to survive, climate breakdown intensifies the pressure, whether through rising sea levels, water shortages, storm damage or crop failures. People living in the most disadvantaged places on Earth – who have contributed the least to the climate crisis – are also the first to face its effects. The devastating storms in Mozambique, the droughts in Somaliland that have killed most of the livestock, and the heatwaves in India are just a taste of things to come if we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. More and more people will have to move just in order to survive.

In the next few decades, millions will be forced to migrate to avoid ever-changing, ever-worsening environmental conditions. So far most of them are migrating internally, from rural to urban areas, or are moving to neighbouring countries. Only a handful travel longer distances. They are then stranded in front of the walls of countries that are often in part responsible for the conditions – both environmental and political – that they are fleeing. The global north conquered and plundered during its colonial heyday, and still holds those countries hostage for debt, but it is also now depriving people of life’s necessities through its own addiction to high-carbon luxury.

Yet we are seeing a rise of rightwing rhetoric across rich nations. This has terrible consequences for those affected, whether it is people taking their own lives in Australia’s notorious Manus and Nauru detention centres, dying in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on the US-Mexico border, or drowning in the Mediterranean – right now the world’s deadliest border. Politicians justify these horrendous conditions on the grounds that they will deter more people from coming. But the numbers of migrants and refugees who keep coming suggest that this strategy is not working. Of course, not all migration is linked to climate breakdown, but the climate emergency will make any “migrant crisis” we have now look like a tea party.

A report by the UN special rapporteur on poverty and human rights warned recently of a future “climate apartheid”, where the global poor will suffer the worst consequences of climate breakdown while the rich buy their way to relative security. “Human rights might not survive the coming upheaval,” the report concludes gloomily. My greatest fear is that this dystopian vision of our future may come true. That the erosion of human rights was already well under way was very clear to me in Italy.

What the Sea-Watch crew and I did was a relatively small thing. A moment of solidarity with those facing an immediate threat to their lives. It’s only as an afterthought that I would agree to call it symbolic. It shows the hypocrisy of the EU’s stance on migration, but also states boldly what kind of future we want: a future of global equality, solidarity and justice.

Working on polar research vessels, I have seen the effects of global heating on nature first-hand. But while volunteering for Sea-Watch, I’ve seen a glimpse of what the future could hold for millions – even billions – of people. There are always those who either manufacture disaster or take advantage of it to gain wealth and power. The climate crisis will cause disasters that could help tyrants and fascists seize the reins. We need to do what we can to stop them from getting a foothold in Europe.

It is not enough for Europeans to applaud those who challenge the Fortress Europe ideology. We will not change anything through passive support – we must all be active in demanding and creating the future that we want. Join activist movements to demand action on climate breakdown. Reduce your personal carbon footprint – dramatically. Help migrants and refugees already in your country to integrate into your society. Support organisations such as Sea-Watch however you can. And speak up against – and vote against – the politics of hate and division.

As a German citizen, I have the privilege of risking arrest without fear of being deported to a dangerous place or being left to drown in the sea. But as a German I have another thought, too. Most of us wonder what we would have done in the 1930s, as racist rhetoric turned into racist policies and, eventually, genocide. My actions with Sea-Watch, I hope, tell me what I would have done had I been alive back then. The question I have for you is: what will you do now?

Methane leak 'visible from space' is even bigger than previously thought. Natural gas well in Ohio released more methane than entire gas industry of many nations.,https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/methane-leak-space-greenhouse-gases-pollution-fracking-ohio-a9249631.html,"The first satellite designed to continuously monitor the planet for methane leaks made a startling discovery last year: A little known gas-well accident at an Ohio fracking site was in fact one of the largest methane leaks ever recorded in the US.

The findings by a Dutch-American team of scientists, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, mark a step forward in using space technology to detect leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, from oil and gas sites worldwide.

The scientists said the new findings reinforced the view that methane releases like these, which are difficult to predict, could be far more widespread than previously thought.

“We’re entering a new era. With a single observation, a single overpass, we’re able to see plumes of methane coming from large emission sources,” said Ilse Aben, an expert in satellite remote sensing and one of the authors of the new research. “That’s something totally new that we were previously not able to do from space.”

Scientists also said the new findings reinforced the view that methane emissions from oil installations are far more widespread than previously thought.

The blowout, in February 2018 at a natural gas well run by an Exxon Mobil subsidiary in Belmont County, Ohio, released more methane than the entire oil and gas industries of many nations do in a year, the research team found.

The Ohio episode forced about 100 residents within a one-mile radius to evacuate their homes while workers scrambled to plug the well.

Natural gas production has come under increased scrutiny because of the prevalence of leaks of methane — the colourless, odourless main component of natural gas — from the fuel’s supply chain.

When burned for electricity, natural gas is cleaner than coal, producing about half the carbon dioxide that coal does.

But if methane escapes into the atmosphere before being burned, it can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period."
"As Coronavirus Hits U.K., Health Workers Fear Getting Sick, and Going Broke. Say they will go to work even when sick.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/europe/coronavirus-health-workers-uk.html,"LONDON — Every workday, Al-Hakim arrives at one of London’s largest public hospitals for a shift as a cleaner, earning little more than minimum wage even though his latest job includes disinfecting rooms reserved for suspected coronavirus patients.

He isn’t certain what he fears most: being exposed to the coronavirus himself, or having to be quarantined for 14 days, as he is one of thousands of private contractors, many of whom receive little sick pay. But he knows what he would do if he did contract the virus — report to work anyway, because he cannot afford to lose even a day’s pay.

“That’s going to be maybe suicide,” said Al-Hakim, who like several other health workers asked not to be identified by their full names, for fear of losing their jobs. “Let’s say I’m sick for one month now — how am I going to pay my rent? The bills are there — how am I going to cope?”

For the moment, Britain has managed to avoid a major outbreak of the coronavirus, with 51 confirmed cases. But as they move to emergency footing this week, government officials are preparing for the possibility that as much as one-fifth of the country’s work force could eventually require some form of sick leave."
"Scientists raise alert as ocean plankton levels plummet. ""Alarm bells start going off because it means that something fundamental may have changed in the food web."" Plankton provide about 70% of the oxygen humans breathe.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/ocean-phytoplankton-zooplankton-food-web-1.4927884,"They're teeny, tiny plants and organisms but their impact on ocean life is huge.​

Phytoplankton and zooplankton that live near the surface are the base of the ocean's food system. Everything from small fish, big fish, whales and seabirds depend on their productivity.

""They actually determine what's going to happen, how much energy is going to be available for the rest of the food chain,"" explained Pierre Pepin, a senior researcher with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in St. John's.

Pepin says over the past three to four years, scientists have seen a persistent drop in phytoplankton and zooplankton in waters off Newfoundland and Labrador.

""Based on the measurements that we've been taking in this region, we've seen pretty close to 50 per cent decline in the overall biomass of zooplankton,"" said Pepin. ""So that's pretty dramatic.""

Measuring five millimetres or less, phytoplankton contain chlorophyll to capture sunlight and use photosynthesis to turn it into chemical energy, which is later eaten by ocean creatures. (Photo courtesy of DFO)

Scientists say local testing reveals half the amount of plankton in a square metre of water today. It's not just a problem here, declining plankton numbers are a global phenomenon.

It's a difficult idea to convey to the average person who might not understand the ocean ecosystem, but Pepin likens it to walking into a grocery store and instead of seeing the shelves full, they're only half-full.

Listen to Jane Adey's coverage on CBC Radio's The Broadcast:

""You know if you saw half the number of birds, if you saw half the number of fish in the water you'd pay attention. Well, this is a signal to say we need to pay attention.""

Alarm bells are going off

So what's causing this dramatic decline?

Scientists here haven't detected anything in particular that can be linked to the plunge in productivity, but they are worried.

Phytoplankton are tiny plants and zooplankton are tiny animals. Zooplankton feed on phytoplankton near the surface of the ocean. (Photo courtesy of DFO)

""When it persists — for in our case now for three or four years — in the back of my mind, at the very least, little alarm bells start going off because it means that something fundamental may have changed in the food web.""

Pepin says it is difficult to understand how long it takes the effect of this lack of basic food to make its way through the ocean ecosystem.

Scientists have to advise managers on how to handle fish stocks but without clear evidence of causes and effects, it becomes a very difficult job.

The EPA has just ruled that industrial farms no longer need to tell the public about toxic emissions.,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-wants-to-grant-factory-farms-exemption-from-reporting-potentially-harmful-emissions-6e944dc36d23/,"What factory farm owners portray as “normal odors” from animal waste can cause serious harm to farmers and the residents who live near these large industrial operations.

The Trump administration, like it has with many important health and safety rules, is siding with industry and ignoring how animal waste can have serious impacts on the health of Americans.

Embracing the “normal odor” argument, acting Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler signed a proposed rule on Tuesday to amend emergency release notification regulations to let industrial agricultural operations off the hook from reporting air emissions from animal waste at their farms.

This is despite the mountain of evidence that shows concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) produce toxic air that can be lethal for farm workers and nearby residents.

“This proposed rule is intended to make it clear to the regulated community that animal waste emissions from farms do not need to be reported under EPCRA,” Wheeler said Tuesday in a statement.

EPCRA stands for the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. In the case of massive farming operations that produce huge amounts of animal waste, Wheeler concluded that communities do not have a right to know about potentially toxic emissions.

Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), who joined Wheeler at the signing ceremony in Kansas, said it was never the intent of Congress for “normal odors from animal waste on farms to fall under the nation’s emergency hazardous waste reporting requirements.”

But these so-called normal odors are “literally choking nearby residents,” responded Hannah Connor, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, who views the proposed rule as “a giant step backward for the health of Americans.”

“We know the millions of pounds of largely untreated waste from the nation’s factory farms are significant sources of air pollution, including ammonia, particulate matter and greenhouse gas methane,” she said in a statement Tuesday.

These pollutants have killed farm workers and residents because of the hydrogen sulfide and other emissions, noted Tarah Heinzen, a staff attorney with Food & Water Watch.

“These are not nuisance odors. These are dangerous emissions that communities have the right to know about,” Heinzen told ThinkProgress.

The EPA, under Wheeler’s leadership, is handing out favors to polluting industries at a similar rate to former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who viewed polluting industries as the stakeholders that needed special protection.

Other recent moves by President Trump’s EPA to undermine the health and safety of Americans include the proposal to roll back federal auto emissions and fuel efficiency standards, plans to weaken the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and the suspension of the Chemical Disaster Rule. In August, though, a federal court delivered a victory to chemical workers and people who live near chemical plants when it ordered the EPA to immediately implement the chemical safety rule.

The air emissions reporting that the Trump administration is trying to eliminate provide state and federal regulators with important data. The reports can be used to determine if the farm should be feeding their livestock different types of feed or if the facilities need different equipment or ventilation to prevent harmful air emissions.

In 2017, a federal court ordered the EPA in 2017 to close a loophole that exempted CAFOs from the same pollutant reporting required of other industries to ensure public safety. Prior to the creation of the loophole at the end of the Bush administration in 2008, federal law long required CAFOs, like all other industrial facilities, to notify government officials when toxic pollution levels exceeded public safety thresholds.

The EPA, though, decided to ignore the court order. Instead, it issued guidance stating reporting does not need to occur from these CAFOs based on its interpretation of EPCRA.

“The Trump administration turned around and issued unlawful guidance that attempted to do exactly what the court had just said was illegal,” Heinzen said.

In March, Trump signed into law a bill known as the FARM Act, which made changes to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The bill was a regulatory rollback that exempted all farms from reporting air releases of hazardous substances from animal waste under CERCLA.

But the new law did not exempt factory farms from reporting requirements under EPCRA, another right-to-know law.

According to Heinzen, the EPA is basing its “unlawful” rule, issued Tuesday, on a misinterpretation of the FARM Act legislation.

Factory farm operators often portray the release of emissions from their facilities as harmless and part of their routine agricultural operations. But sudden exposure to these toxic emissions can be fatal: one study found that 19 workers at CAFOs were killed from hydrogen sulfide released during manure agitation. Chronic exposures to lower levels of these pollutants are also associated with a long list of health impacts, including headaches, respiratory irritation, and nausea.

People who live nearby suffer from constant exposure to foul odors, as well as the toxic effects of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. At low levels, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. Prolonged exposure to ammonia can burn lung tissue, and the long-term effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure include memory loss, poor motor function, and decreased attention span.

“Although the Trump Administration and its allies sometimes dismiss this issue as farm ‘odors,’ the ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and other air pollutants from concentrated animal feeding operations that sometimes hold tens of thousands animals can pose a serious threat to public health,” Abel Russ, attorney with the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement emailed to ThinkProgress.

On Monday, Food & Water Watch and the Environmental Integrity Project joined other groups in filing a request for summary judgment in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that would require the EPA to reverse its guidance issued in 2017 that exempted factory farms from reporting their toxic emissions from animal waste under EPCRA.

Heinzen said she could not comment on Food & Water Watch’s legal strategy with regard to the proposed rule issued Tuesday. But she explained the rule is illegal for many of the same reasons that the group is fighting the guidance that the EPA issued to factory farms in 2017.

“This administration and past administrations have repeatedly tried to claim that factory farm pollution is the same as any odor you would get from living in a rural community from a family farm,” she said. “And we know that’s not true. These are industrial facilities that emit industrial amounts of dangerous pollutants.”

The public will have 30 days to comment on the proposed rule after it’s published in the Federal Register."
"Largest five stock-market-listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m each year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report,"This article is more than 1 year old

This article is more than 1 year old

The largest five stock market listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m (£153m) a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change, according to a new report.

Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil were the main companies leading the field in direct lobbying to push against a climate policy to tackle global warming, the report said.

Increasingly they are using social media to successfully push their agenda to weaken and oppose any meaningful legislation to tackle global warming.

In the run-up to the US midterm elections last year $2m was spent on targeted Facebook and Instagram ads by global oil giants and their industry bodies, promoting the benefits of increased fossil fuel production, according to the report published on Friday by InfluenceMap.

Separately, BP donated $13m to a campaign, also supported by Chevron, that successfully stopped a carbon tax in Washington state – $1m of which was spent on social media ads, the research shows.

Edward Collins, the report’s author, analysed corporate spending on lobbying, briefing and advertising, and assessed what proportion was dedicated to climate issues.

He said: “Oil majors’ climate branding sounds increasingly hollow and their credibility is on the line. They publicly support climate action while lobbying against binding policy. They advocate low-carbon solutions but such investments are dwarfed by spending on expanding their fossil fuel business.”

After the Paris climate agreement in 2015 the large integrated oil and gas companies said they supported a price on carbon and formed groups like the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative which promote voluntary measures.

But, the report states, there is a glaring gap between their words and their actions.

The five publicly listed oil majors – ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, BP and Total – now spend about $195m a year on branding campaigns suggesting they support action against climate change.

But the report said these campaigns were misleading the public about the extent of the oil companies’ actions because while publicly endorsing the need to act, they are massively increasing investment in a huge expansion of oil and gas extraction. In 2019 their spending will increase to $115bn, with just 3% of that directed at low carbon projects.

Shell said in a statement: “We firmly reject the premise of this report. We are very clear about our support for the Paris agreement, and the steps that we are taking to help meet society’s needs for more and cleaner energy.

“We make no apology for talking to policymakers and regulators around the world to make our voice heard on crucial topics such as climate change and how to address it.”

Chevron said it disagreed with the report’s findings. “Chevron is taking prudent, cost-effective actions and is committed to working with policymakers to design balanced and transparent greenhouse gas emissions reductions policies that address environmental goals and ensure consumers have access to affordable, reliable and ever cleaner energy.”

The successful lobbying and direct opposition to policy measures to tackle global warming have hindered governments globally in their efforts to implement policies after the Paris agreement to meet climate targets and keep warming below 1.5C."
Millennial loneliness poll: 22 percent say they have “no friends”,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/1/20750047/millennials-poll-loneliness,"Today, members of the millennial generation are ages 23 to 38. These ought to be prime years of careers taking off and starting families, before joints really begin to ache. Yet as a recent poll and some corresponding research indicate, there’s something missing for many in this generation: companionship.

A recent poll from YouGov, a polling firm and market research company, found that 30 percent of millennials say they feel lonely. This is the highest percentage of all the generations surveyed.

Furthermore, 22 percent of millennials in the poll said they had zero friends. Twenty-seven percent said they had “no close friends,” 30 percent said they have “no best friends,” and 25 percent said they have no acquaintances. (I wonder if the poll respondents have differing thoughts on what “acquaintance” means; I take it to mean “people you interact with now and then.”)

In comparison, just 16 percent of Gen Xers and 9 percent of baby boomers say they have no friends.

The poll, which looked at 1,254 adults 18 and up, did not report results for the up-and-coming Gen Z (who report high levels of loneliness on other surveys), or for the oldest adults in the country. And we should note: Loneliness tends to increase markedly after age 75; social isolation among the elderly remains a huge problem that will only grow worse as baby boomers age. So perhaps it’s not the case that millennials are the loneliest of all.

Still, the findings on millennials are surprising. Why do a fifth of these 20- and 30-somethings say they lack friends? YouGov’s poll didn’t measure why.

If this generation is truly lonelier, that’s concerning for a number of reasons: Research shows that loneliness tends to increase as we get older. What will happen to millennials, who are already reporting high levels of loneliness, when they reach old age?

It also raises the question of whether everyone who’s lonely, millennials included, is more isolated from spending more time on the internet. (Though there’s also evidence that the internet can help lonely, isolated people connect with others.)

But while there may be something particular happening with millennials, it’s also possible loneliness naturally ebbs and flows throughout life. A 1990 meta-analysis (a study of studies), which included data on 25,000 people, found that “loneliness was highest among young adults, declined over midlife, and increased modestly in old age.”

So there may be a cycle and it might not be new. Many 30-somethings find it gets harder to make new friends as they age. Friends move, family and work obligations increase, and plans to reconnect get perpetually booted into the future on email chains.

More recently, in a 2016 paper, researchers in Germany found a peak of loneliness in a sample of 16,000 Germans at around age 30, another around age 50, and then increasing again at age 80.

“We don’t quite know why this is happening,” said Maike Luhmann, a psychologist who researches loneliness at Ruhr-Universität Bochum and co-authored the paper. “So most of the previous research has focused on old age, and for good reason, because it’s when loneliness levels are high.”

The bigger point, she said, was “researchers have ignored that loneliness can happen at any time.”

And that’s important. Because loneliness is bad for our health.

Loneliness is associated with higher blood pressure and heart disease — it literally breaks our hearts. A 2015 meta-review of 70 studies showed that loneliness increases the risk of dying by 26 percent. (Compare that to depression and anxiety, which is associated with a comparable 21 percent increase in mortality.) There’s evidence that chronic loneliness can turn on genes involved with inflammation, which can be a risk factor for heart disease and cancer.

Make no mistake: We need stress. We need some amount of loneliness. The pain of loneliness is a reminder that we are social creatures who need other people. It’s also important to recognize that loneliness isn’t the same as having few friends. It’s the perceived social isolation that harms us. We can certainly have fulfilling, protective relationships with just a few people.

“As long as we then do what we should do — reconnect with people — then loneliness is a good thing,” Luhmann said. “It becomes a bad thing when it becomes chronic. That’s when the health effects kick in. And it becomes harder and harder to connect with other people the longer you are in the state of loneliness.”"
"India, one of the world's largest exporters of onions, has banned the export of onions due to crop damage.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/02/india-economy-modi-government-bans-onion-exports-after-prices-soar.html,"India banned the export of onions after excessive rainfall damaged crops and reduced harvest, which sent prices soaring at a time when slowing consumer demand has dragged down growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

The ban took effect on Sunday and will last ""till further orders,"" according to a government notice. Several media reports said prices of onions — a common ingredient in Indian cooking — have doubled since July.

India is one of the top exporters of onions globally. During the 2018 calendar year, the country sold 2.2 billion kilograms — worth around $514.3 million — of fresh and chilled onions overseas, according to official trade data. But onion exports accounted for just 0.16% of the country's overall exports last year, the data showed.

Still, the export ban is not the only move that Indian authorities have taken to tame soaring prices given the importance of the vegetable to domestic consumers.

The government has tried to bring down domestic prices by releasing supplies from its national buffer stocks. It also set a minimum export price on onion shipments earlier in September at a level it had hoped would discourage foreign buyers. The government also withdrew an export incentive in June."
Record Inequality and Corporate Profits Are What Media Call a ‘Strong Economy’,https://fair.org/home/record-inequality-and-corporate-profits-are-what-media-call-a-strong-economy/,"Last month, CNBC (10/7/19) reassured us that fears of a potential recession are “overblown,” because the “hard data” shows that the “US economy remains strong.”

If you’ve been keeping track of corporate media coverage of the US economy over the past several years, you might have noticed a contradictory pattern. You’ll find that corporate media make ubiquitous references to a “strong economy,” while simultaneously providing many reports on the increasingly impoverished and precarious working class alongside the continuously rising fortunes of the rich.

Last month, a New York Times report (10/20/19) exemplified this seemingly bizarre practice when it wondered why so many workers are striking when we apparently live in such a “strong economy,” because the piece also discussed how “today’s strikes are fueled by a deeper sense of unfairness and economic anxiety.”

Even though corporate media are now warning us not to be too complacent because of a potential imminent recession and slowing GDP growth (CNN, 8/18/19; Wall Street Journal, 10/30/19), references to a “strong economy” and an “economic recovery” from the Great Recession still abound.

Three years ago, the New York Times (12/2/16) remarked that former President Barack Obama was handing off a “strong economy” to President Donald Trump, even as it noted that “tens of millions of Americans understandably feel that the recovery has passed them by.” Two years later, Times columnist David Brooks (11/29/18) led off a column by declaring, “We’re enjoying one of the best economies of our lifetime.”

This year, the Los Angeles Times (5/3/19) pondered the two “great conundrums” of the Trump presidency: “How does his approval rating stay so bad when the economy is so good, and what might that forecast about his prospects for reelection?”

Politico (10/15/19) and Reuters (10/15/19) advise us that election models are forecasting Trump’s likely reelection based on “economic trends in key swing states” under his administration, as CNN (7/5/19) proclaimed that the “strong economy” is functioning as Trump’s “safety blanket” for his reelection chances. The Financial Times (5/8/19) declared that “there is no doubt that the US is the strongest large economy in the world,” even as it warned that “much of the growth surprise appears temporary.”

The “strong economy” narrative is so thoroughly entrenched, the Atlantic (8/5/19) observed that even Democratic presidential candidates are wary of mentioning “economic growth,” lest it sound like an implicit endorsement of the Trump administration’s policies. However, following slower GDP growth and recession forecasts, some Democratic presidential candidates, like Joe Biden, are changing their campaign strategies by claiming that Trump is “squandering” the “strong economy” inherited from the Obama administration, reversing their previous view of discussing the “strong economic data” as a “losing” electoral strategy (Reuters, 8/22/19).

To the extent that there is a “debate” over the existence of a “historic recovery” and a “strong economy,” it is largely restricted to whether the economy was better under the Obama administration or under the Trump administration, and over who “really” deserves credit for this allegedly amazing economy.

The Washington Post has run several comparative articles (6/25/18, 5/7/19, 8/20/19) arguing that Trump “inherited” the “strong economy” from Obama, even wondering if this economy is “too good to be true?” while noting that the “vital signs look solid.” CNBC (9/7/18) declared that Trump has “set economic growth on fire,” praising a “economic boom uniquely his” as a “tremendous achievement.” The Wall Street Journal (5/5/19) discussed how a poll found that “select groups of Americans” who disapprove of his job performance are still willing to credit Trump for a “bustling economy,” while USA Today (7/1/19) discussed a survey that found that the “solid economy is doing little to bolster support for President Donald Trump.” Some articles have pushed back on the idea that Trump deserves the credit for the “strong economy,” instead crediting the Federal Reserve and Congress, or a vague “broader, global trend” (New York Times, 8/8/19; Wall Street Journal, 11/8/17).

But who determines whether we live in a “strong economy,” and what metrics should we use to find out? Despite what media say, most Americans believe that the economic system is “rigged” to benefit the wealthy elite at the expense of the working class (CNN, 6/28/16; Pew Research, 10/4/18; Common Dreams, 4/29/19). Do the standard economic metrics deployed by corporate journalists accurately capture and explain the feelings and economic situation of most American workers?

When one also reads the contradictory coverage found in corporate media regarding the precarious situation facing the American working class, it’s clear they don’t. Here’s a nonexhaustive catalog of facts that make elite pundits like the New York Times’ David Brooks’ declaration that “We’re enjoying one of the best economies of our lifetime” appear fatuous and puncture this myth of a “strong economy.”

Overwhelmingly, many of these reports point to GDP growth (increased annual spending on total goods and services), a low unemployment rate (currently at 3.6%) and the number of jobs added to the US economy as evidence of a “strong economy.”

However, the standard unemployment rate in the US only includes people with no job who have been searching for work within the past four weeks; this leaves out significant portions of the population, like the underemployed and involuntary part-time workers (those who want full-time work but can’t find any), and discouraged workers who have given up searching for a job (Quartz, 6/7/18). This is why the New York Times (10/31/19) found that there are still millions of people not captured in the official unemployment rate, and people having trouble finding work in this “strong economy.” The U-6 unemployment rate, considered to be more accurate by economists because it includes discouraged workers and part-time workers seeking full-time employment, is 7%—almost double the U-3 unemployment rate usually cited by corporate media.

Another figure that complicates this picture of a “strong economy” is the labor force participation rate (the sum of all workers who are employed and actively seeking employment divided by the total working age population). The current labor force participation rate is 63.3%, 4 percentage points lower than the average of 67.3% at the beginning of the 21st century.

Although the number of involuntary part-time workers dropped this year, even people who only work one hour a week would not be considered unemployed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 2016 study by economist Lonnie Golden found that the number of involuntary part-time workers increased almost 45% from 2007.

While there has been pushback against a widely cited 2016 study from economists Lawrence Katz and the late Alan Krueger, which found that 94% of job growth from 2005 to 2015 has been in precarious “alternative work arrangements” in the “gig economy,” there’s no shortage of studies and projections showing that freelancing, independent contracting and temp work for corporations like Uber are playing a larger role in the US economy, without much of the job security and benefits found in more traditional jobs (NBC, 8/31/17; Forbes, 2/15/19; New York Times, 8/22/19).

Critically, throughout several years of reports on this “strong economy,” there have also been numerous reports on the persistent problem of low and stagnant wages. Although there are reports indicating that workers are finally seeing slightly better wage growth after decades of stagnant wages, it’s still only a fraction of record corporate profits (Washington Post, 11/2/18).

The long-term trend of wages not keeping up with the prices of essentials hasn’t improved much, as it’s been reported that minimum-wage workers can’t afford a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the US. (The Economic Policy Institute—7/19/18, 2/5/19—found that if the minimum wage tracked productivity growth since the 1960s, it would now be over $20 an hour.)

Almost half of US families are unable to afford the basics like rent and food, and 40% can’t afford an unexpected $400 expense, with almost 80% of US workers living paycheck to paycheck. Perhaps this is why increasing numbers of people are living in poverty, in cars and on the streets, despite having jobs (CBS, 7/31/18; New York Times, 9/11/18; Washington Post, 3/22/19). These low and stagnant wages may also be why Americans are increasingly buried in debt, as student loan debt reached $1.5 trillion last year, exceeding all other forms of consumer debt except mortgages, and auto debt is up nearly 40% from the last decade, reaching $1.3 trillion (Wall Street Journal, 8/1/19).

One of the grimmest signs that the economy is not working for many is that US life expectancy continues to drop, from a peak of 78.9 in 2014 to 78.6 in 2017. The drop is led by rising deaths from suicide, drug overdose and alcohol-related disease—known as “diseases of despair”—among men, particularly those without college degrees (Brookings Institution, 11/7/19).

Richard Wolff has been one of the few economists who have argued that the media’s false “recovery hype” is a “weapon of mass distraction” (Extra!, 12/14) and observed (in Capitalism’s Crisis Deepens) that the finance industry’s decades-long wave of spectacular growth has coincided with stagnating wages beginning in the 1970s, as more and more Americans have to rely on debt to maintain their lifestyle and keep up with the soaring costs of essentials like housing, healthcare and higher education. Historically, private debt—not public debt—is the harbinger of economic disaster, contrary to the obsessive focus of media austerity hawks (Atlantic, 9/9/14; Guardian, 11/4/13; FAIR.org, 2/22/19).

Despite corporate media’s ludicrous “factchecks” on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ (correct) claim that “three people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America” (the Washington Post argued that the comparison is “not especially meaningful,” because “people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth, as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have”), journalists have consistently reported on the reality of rising prosperity of the wealthy, record stock markets and soaring corporate profits. (Of course, such stories are often presented as good news, as if higher stock prices benefited anyone other than people who own stock—Extra!, 7–8/02.)

Matt Bruenig at the People’s Policy Project found that the top 1 percent’s net worth has increased by $21 trillion, while the bottom 50% of the population saw theirs decrease by $900 billion, from 1989 to 2018. Perhaps this is due to massive criminal tax evasion/avoidance by the wealthy and corporations in overseas tax havens (euphemistically labeled “loopholes”), coupled with unprecedented tax cuts for the rich, alongside relentless selective enforcement and increased taxes on the working class (FAIR.org, 12/6/17, 1/17/18).

Given all this, GDP growth tells us little about how wealth and income are distributed amongst the US population. It’s theoretically possible for GDP growth to be entirely accounted for by things like increased military spending for a US-driven arms race, corporations buying back stocks and paying out dividends to further inflate their stock prices—instead of giving raises to employees or hiring more of them—and the wealthy’s environmentally destructive conspicuous consumption of things like private jets and superyachts, since all of them count towards GDP. Journalists shouldn’t use GDP as an indicator of economic health without further context, because growing GDP alongside skyrocketing income and wealth inequality is not evidence of a “strong” economy, but of a parasitic economy.

What explains corporate media’s credulous reliance on uninformative economic measures, and contradictory references to a “strong economy,” alongside reports on a struggling working class? It makes little sense if one assumes corporate journalists are primarily concerned with informing the public. It makes a great deal of sense when one realizes that corporate news outlets have an inherent interest in cloaking class warfare by equating a “strong economy” with the prosperity of the investor class, even if it comes at the expense of everyone else (FAIR.org, 10/16/19)."
'Terrifying' New Climate Models Warn of 6-7°C of Warming by 2100 If Emissions Not Slashed,https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/09/17/terrifying-new-climate-models-warn-6-7degc-warming-2100-if-emissions-not-slashed,"New climate models unveiled by French researchers Tuesday showed Earth's average temperature could rise a ""terrifying"" 6.5-7.0°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century if dramatic action is not immediately taken to slash carbon emissions.

The findings, presented at a press conference in Paris, suggest the planet may be warming significantly faster than scientists previously believed as the world's major economies continue to burn fossil fuels at unsustainable rates.

""Unfortunately, our global failure to implement meaningful action on climate change over recent decades has put us in a situation where what we need to do to keep warming to safe levels is extremely simple,"" Joeri Rogelj, an associate professor at Imperial College London, told AFP. ""Global greenhouse gas emissions need to decline today rather than tomorrow, and global CO2 emissions should be brought to net zero.""

The new models are expected to form part of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report, which is set to be published in 2021. The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, published in 2014, presented a worst-case scenario of five degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.

Olivier Boucher, head of the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Modeling Center in Paris, which developed one of the new models, said the latest data provide a better look at where the climate is heading without drastic changes to global energy production.

""We have better models now,"" Boucher told AFP on Tuesday. ""They have better resolution, and they represent current climate trends more accurately.""

Bloomberg reported that just ""one of the updated climate models used by the researchers allowed for the global temperature increase to remain below 2°C by the end of the century."" That model assumed global carbon neutrality by 2060.

The worst-case scenario of 6.5-7.0°C of warming assumed continued economic expansion driven by growth of fossil fuel production.

That 2.5 degree global temperature increase that was predicted to happen this century has been revised to 6.5-7 degrees. This is not good. https://t.co/DDZFSRAmSj — Megara9 (@Meg9Time) September 17, 2019

The IPCC warned last year that even limiting planetary warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century, the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, would not prevent many of the disastrous effects of the climate crisis. Warming of 6.5-7.0°C would be catastrophic.

""Higher warming would allow less time to adapt and mean a greater likelihood of passing climate 'tipping points' such as thawing of permafrost, which would further accelerate warming,"" said Boucher.

In an email to Common Dreams, Penn State University climate scientist Michael E. Mann sounded a note of caution about the dire scenarios predicted by the new models.

""Some earlier versions of the models appeared to underestimate climate sensitivity somewhat,"" said Mann, ""and I suspect that some of these more recent versions are actually over-estimating it a bit.""

""I suspect, when all is said and done, we're probably looking at something in the range of 3-4°C and no higher, at least for near-term warming,"" Mann added. ""If we allow the warm[ing] to persist for centuries, then other long-term positive feedbacks (vicious cycles) could kick in, giving us substantially more warming."""
"""Under the Weather: As Psychiatrists And Philosophers Begin To Define A Pervasive Mental Health Crisis Triggered By Climate Change, They Ask Who Is Really Sick: The Individual Or Society?""",https://believermag.com/under-the-weather/,"On a bright fall day in 1991, Chris Foster left his differential equations class at the University of California, Davis, bypassed students lounging on the quad, and headed toward the Domes, an on-campus co-op housing development. Although it was November, he was wearing his usual uniform: pink shorts, no shirt, no shoes. At the Domes, he harvested mesquite in a grove of trees and picked wild radishes and mallow in a nearby field. He then walked three miles west to Village Homes, another co-op, which he knew would be a scavenger’s cornucopia: full of late-season figs, apples, nuts, and wild grapes. Chris harvested only fallen fruit—he felt this was less invasive than picking from trees, and his aim was to tread lightly on the earth, to be almost invisible, in order to cause as little harm as possible.

Chris was a philosophy and math major, and he liked to think of himself as the Diogenes of Davis, a reference to the fourth-century BCE Cynic philosopher who renounced wealth and slept outdoors in a large ceramic jar. Chris had made a habit of trying to last the night outside without a sleeping bag. “I couldn’t accept the privileges of humanity when I didn’t want any part of humanity,” he told me. Eating fallen fruit and sleeping outside, however, didn’t provide him relief from his feelings of guilt and foreboding. He began to feel a dread that was inescapable and all-consuming. A devastating depression that he had suffered a few years before that fall semester returned. Normally a math phenom, Chris started failing his tests. In his apartment, he would sit in the dark—he didn’t want to waste electricity—listen to records, and cry. “I felt like I was slowly dying,” he said.

A few months later, Chris left Davis to pursue a PhD in philosophy at the University of Kansas. But his condition didn’t improve. After having subsisted on scavenged persimmons and radishes for the entire fall term, he’d lost a dangerous amount of weight. His mother paid a visit to campus and, horrified by his appearance, immediately drove him to the grocery store to buy food. At home, Chris’s family had a hard time understanding the intensity of the self-denial that governed his life. His father and sister blamed his breakdown on abuse that Chris had suffered as a child; they believed his desire to escape society was a projection, an act of taking responsibility for something that wasn’t his fault. But Chris had a different explanation. When he was fifteen, his father had taken him and his sister on a trip to Mount St. Helens. Halfway up the mountain, they had passed clear-cut land. As Chris recalls, one moment there was only evergreen forest and the next moment there was nothing—just bare ground and stumps as far as he could see. A word came to his mind: evil. From that day forward, something shifted in him. He didn’t want any part of such destruction. By his senior year in college, this conviction had grown into a personal mandate to renounce participation in human society altogether. He was offended by his family’s attempts to find explanations in his psychology for problems he thought of as external to him. “Why does my grief have to be because something bad happened to me?” he told me. “They made it sound like I had a psychosis or a mental breakdown and that this is just the form it took, when really, shouldn’t anyone who is ethical and compassionate also choose to opt out of this society?”

I met Chris in 2004, when he was a professor at Brigham Young University, more than a decade after he left Davis. He had converted to Mormonism; I had been raised in the church but was on my way out. The first time I saw him, he was giving an animated anti-hunting lecture, bobbing up and down in front of a whiteboard scribbled with exhortations on animal rights (this in an avidly pro-hunting, conservative state). I was wearing a shirt that said My name is Ashley Sanders—something I thought was hilarious, for reasons that now elude me—and when I walked through the door of the classroom, Chris stopped his lecture to say, “Hello, Ashley Sanders.” We immediately became friends.

In 2009, discouraged by the failed climate talks in Copenhagen, Chris told me he believed it might already be too late to stop catastrophic climate change. “The old world,” he said, “is gone.” It was a torch-passing moment. Chris was paralyzed by a conviction in his own failure. He had become complacent, he felt, and addicted to television: the sort of person he used to despise. But I was just beginning my own journey into environmental despair. I was full of guilt and anxiety and anger and fear about a future filled with loss and death. I began to draw my own elliptical lines through the ethics of the climate crisis. I turned off the heat in my house, even during the bitter Utah winters. I was late everywhere, determined to take a bus to another bus to a train. I obsessed over plastic bags and Styrofoam plates, and insisted on bringing my own plate to a local sandwich shop. I carried my garbage around for a week and roped my friends into doing so, too, each of us hauling a stinking reminder of our consumption from class to class, clearing rooms as we went. I joined a direct action climate justice group; I planned blockades of city streets and got arrested. I joined with Utah Valley farmers to organize against urban sprawl. I camped in the high deserts of western Utah, trying, with my body and the bodies of others, to physically stop construction on a tar sands mine. I lay down in front of the federal building in Salt Lake City, in the rain, to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline, a poster draped over my body disintegrating in the downpour. I went to Earth First! direct action trainings, where I learned how to lock myself to fences, pipelines, and other people. When I became devastated by the fact that nothing was happening, I joined radical anti-civilization listservs and groups, where people talked seriously about destroying electric, gas, and internet infrastructure and bringing down industrial society.

I was working fifty-hour weeks, mostly unpaid. My mother, concerned, suggested that I take a break. But I refused. There was no pause button on climate change, so why should I get a break? On some days, Salt Lake City, where I lived, had exceptionally bad air quality, a thick soup of pollution settling between the mountains and the valley. The corridor between Salt Lake and Provo, where I’d gone to college, had been completely converted from farmland to strip malls in just ten years. To the south lay one of the biggest open-pit copper mines in the world, to the north was an industrial warren of refineries, and to the west was nuclear waste buried in clay-sealed chambers, reeking of death. That was just the local stuff. Coral reefs were collapsing, ocean ecosystems were overfished, and people in island nations were trapped between salted well water and the swallowing sea.

Meanwhile, everyone around me was fine. Most of them weren’t climate deniers, yet none of them seemed disturbed by what they claimed to know. When I talked about how I really felt, environmental leaders cautioned me. “The key is to be positive,” they said. “Nobody likes doom and gloom.” For me, though, eight years of overwork, stress, and anxiety had taken a toll. My partner and I fought constantly. I had nightmares when I fell asleep and daymares when I read the news. I was sick all the time. I came to hate humankind, its happiness and calm. I went to therapists who stared at me quizzically. I was sad about what? “The end of the world,” I said, again and again. Finally, at a loss, they diagnosed me with depression.

Eventually, I left it all. I retreated with my girlfriend to a cabin in upstate New York: no email, no news, no crises. I knew what I wanted. I wanted a world that would last through the century. I wanted a world where my existence didn’t mean the end for others. But, barring that, I really wanted just one thing: To grieve. To say, This is unbearable, and to have people to try to bear it with.

My burnout lasted five years. I still read the news before going to bed—I couldn’t help myself. Then, as my partner slept next to me, I’d watch videos of endangered species: a North Atlantic right whale mother swimming with her calves—3 of only 411 left; a free diver swimming with a great white shark, her hand placed gently on its side. I watched as the Shaw Centre for the Salish Sea released a giant Pacific octopus called The Dude back into the wild to live his final days at sea. The Dude trundled along the ocean floor, his eight legs whirling. He played with the divers’ cameras as they filmed him. Watching these videos felt like a ritual. It was my way of saying goodbye, I suppose, to creatures I had never met but would miss anyway.

The night I watched The Dude’s oceanic return, I happened upon an article on the Permian extinction. Two hundred and fifty-two million years ago, the article said, a series of volcanic eruptions spewed plumes of carbon into the atmosphere, turning the world into a hothouse in a geologic blink of an eye. In response, 96 percent of animals on earth went extinct. Insects were wiped out completely. It took the earth ten million years to recover. And then there was the kicker: now, for the first time in hundreds of millions of years, the article said, we are seeing a trajectory toward Permian levels of carbon in the atmosphere.

So this is it, I thought. This is how it will end. I wanted to act. But I was afraid of becoming shrill again, afraid of my urge to grab plastic bags out of people’s hands and force my partner to turn down the thermostat and try to fit animal extinction into casual conversation. I was afraid I would become a purist and a martyr, taking all the sorrow and all the suffering on myself because I didn’t know how else to reconcile my smallness with the hugeness of the problem.

I wasn’t immune to social cues. I knew I was supposed to agree that biodegradable cups were helping or that the empathy of the next generation would pull us out or that—a common response—not all life would be lost, and that humans, resilient, would go on. In each of these conversations, there was a subtext: This is where you nod and agree. This is where you choose this friendship over party-pooping facts. This is where you stop.

Sometimes I could do it. Other times I got combative, desperate, contrary. Meanwhile, Chris got married and had two children. When we hung out, he was happier. But he was different too. In his purist days, he’d let his lawn go to seed, refusing to use scarce water resources to keep it green. Now he was living in the suburbs, putting in Kentucky bluegrass. “Why don’t you just keep your lawn the way it was?” I said, too urgently. “Because I’ve been sad my whole life,” Chris said, “and sometimes I just want to sit on my green lawn with my wife and feel love.” I knew it was just a lawn, but it upset me anyway. Chris had been the one person who understood me, who didn’t make me feel crazy or as if I was extreme for what I believed. We argued; I left. I knew I’d hurt Chris’s feelings, and I felt terrible for it. I also knew I meant what I’d said. But it went deeper than that. Chris had chosen happiness over constant stress. Was this the ultimate choice: Caring for yourself or caring for the world? If it was, I didn’t want to know.

I quit climate activism for a time, but I’ve kept going to therapy, and I keep confusing my therapists by talking about the end of the world. As it turns out, I’m not alone. A report released in 2012 by the National Wildlife Federation warned that climate change is creating a mental health crisis. The climate scientists, psychologists, and policy experts who authored the study estimated that two hundred million Americans will suffer from mental illness as a result of natural disasters, droughts, heat waves, and economic downturn. Recent disasters bear this out. In the wake of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster on record, there was a 7 percent spike in PTSD among the children who survived. In the year after Hurricane Katrina, the suicide rate in New Orleans tripled, and the number of instances of depression and PTSD grew to what health experts described as near-epidemic levels. Even people who aren’t directly impacted by climate disasters can be affected. According to a 2017 report by the American Psychological Association, merely acknowledging the reality of climate change and its consequences can trigger chronic fear, fatalism, anger, and exhaustion—a condition that psychologists are increasingly referring to as eco-anxiety.

Eco-anxiety can manifest in other serious ways. In 2008, in the midst of a severe drought in Australia, a seventeen-year-old boy refused to drink water because he was afraid that doing so would lead to the deaths of millions of people. Doctors diagnosed him with “climate delusion” and prescribed antidepressants. When they asked him why he took such drastic action, he said he felt guilty. Since then, his doctors have treated other young people with climate-related psychosis, as well as children with recurring nightmares about climate disaster. In Delhi, a pile of skulls near India’s Parliament serves as a reminder of the country’s nearly sixty thousand farmer suicides, which experts say were connected to drought and rising temperatures in the region. (More than twelve thousand farmers killed themselves in India in 2015 alone.) Greta Thunberg, a sixteen-year-old Swedish girl who inspired the growing student climate strike movement, says that learning about climate change—and seeing adults’ inaction—contributed to a severe depression during which she stopped eating and drinking.

In the United States, a group of twenty-one young people filed a lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, that argues that the government’s inaction on climate change will cause psychological damage to future generations. (The Trump administration has fought the suit at every step, and it is currently on hold.) Still other activists are turning the violence of climate change on themselves—like David Buckel, a human rights lawyer who in 2018 lit himself on fire in Prospect Park, in Brooklyn, to call attention to the scale of the climate plight.

The emergent understanding of the psychological harm caused by climate change is at the root of a new field known as ecopsychology. According to one of its founders, historian Theodore Roszak, the purpose of the discipline is to define “‘sanity’ as if the whole world mattered.” Ecopsychologists view the Cartesian separation of mind and body—an outlook taken for granted in mainstream medicine—as antiquated and harmful, and argue that it can lead to people viewing themselves as separate from the planet they live on. Because traditional psychologists limit their examinations to individuals and their internal maladies, they stamp a “sick” label on patients like Chris and me in an attempt to treat the person instead of treating the problem. Within ecopsychology, the solution is not to pathologize patients but to help them restore their sense of control by reconnecting them with the natural world.

Bruce Levine, a self-described dissident psychiatrist, believes that forces like climate change have real consequences for the human body. But he thinks it’s problematic to consider this sort of anxiety and depression a mental illness. “When you start labeling those problems as a sickness,” he said, “political awareness starts to drift away.” For example, he told me, PTSD was a diagnosis in vogue after the Vietnam War. The effects of PTSD are real, he said, “but in retrospect, were we not better off calling this problem ‘being fucked-up by war?’” To Levine, situating sickness only inside the individual is a way for the psychiatric profession to ensure its viability. “It’s how we support the power structure,” he told me. “We take problems that financial and political assholes created by being uncaring, and now we feel good about solving the problem.”

Critics argue that ecopsychology is a flabby discipline without clear boundaries or time-tested methods. They accept recent studies showing that exposure to nature can have positive effects on human health, but they don’t necessarily believe the opposite—that the destruction of nature can make people sick. Robert Salo, the doctor who diagnosed the Australian boy with climate psychosis, was careful to note the boy’s other symptoms (long-term depression, suicidal thoughts, and hearing voices) and the disproportionate sense of importance he placed on his own actions (believing that his own small water usage would lead to widespread deaths). Other critics have pointed out that climate delusion usually afflicts people who already suffer from other mental health maladies, and that the triggers for psychotic episodes generally take the form of the dominant political or cultural issues of the time, from nuclear holocaust to Cold War–era fears about the spread of communism. These critics might argue that people like Chris and me are predisposed to guilt, compulsion, or a grandiose sense of our own importance based on our past experiences and our chemical makeup, and that if climate change hadn’t set us off, something else would have. They might point out that our beliefs endangered ourselves and worried others—so, practically speaking, we were sick, and we did need traditional treatment.

The critics are right about two things: Chris and I are sick, and we need treatment. But they’re missing a critical perspective. If we are sick because our society is sick, shouldn’t society be treated alongside the patient? Ultimately, a lot of the disagreement over climate-induced mental illness boils down to vocabulary. We have words to describe the flu, or depression, or the common cold. We know the contours and symptoms of these illnesses. But when it comes to climate grief, the experience can be hard to define, and thus harder to understand and demonstrate. If climate sickness exists in the overlap of the physical and the emotional, we need words for those feelings, a dictionary of sorts that allows us to see patterns in the experiences of individual people. Fortunately, that’s exactly what a group of motley philosophers, artists, and doctors are currently working to devise.

In the nineteenth century, the Upper Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Australia, was called the Tuscany of the South for its landscape of rolling hills and winding rivers, trees, and savannah. In the ’80s, when Glenn Albrecht arrived there to write a book about two ornithologists, he was confronted with an entirely different vista: a massive clear-cut coal mine, soon to be the world’s largest. He returned regularly to the valley over the years, and by the ’90s it had been gutted, with more than 15 percent of the valley floor exposed. The homes in the path of the mines had been bought and bulldozed; those remaining, on the edge of the pits, were covered in soot. Dust and grime hung in the air. Klieg lights lit up the sky twenty-four hours a day. Birdsong had been replaced by the noise of detonations. It felt, Albrecht said, “like walking into an apocalypse.”

Between visits, Albrecht returned to the University of Newcastle, where he was an environmental studies professor. Even among the town’s sun-soaked hills and beaches, he couldn’t shake the feeling of distress that the mine had provoked in him. Eventually, after he’d made many trips to the Upper Hunter Valley, locals began calling him. Their homes were being destroyed by the mines, they said, and they asked for his help. Albrecht was an environmental writer and advocate, and he was accustomed to people asking for his advice, but the desperation, sorrow, and panic in these voices constituted something different: palpable grief. The mines could and did make people physically sick, with asthma and cancer, and led to high rates of birth defects. The mines also destroyed their houses. But it was apparent to Albrecht that the residents’ pain was emotional as well as physical. It seemed they were not losing just their homes but their home, their sense of belonging to a place. He started to see a relationship between environmental and psychological distress, between the health of the land and the health of its people.

As a philosopher, Albrecht determined to identify and name this condition. The word he came up with was solastalgia, a portmanteau word of the Latin solus, which means “abandonment and loneliness,” and nostalgia. Nostalgia has not always had the warm and fuzzy connotations it does now. When it was first used, in the seventeenth century, it described a diagnosable illness that afflicted people who were far from home but could not return. Soldiers were particularly susceptible, as were people forced into migration by conflict, colonization, and slavery. The cure, it was thought, was simply to return home and be soothed by familiarity—

otherwise, the sufferer’s distress would continue, even to the point of death. To Albrecht, if nostalgia was a sickness caused by the displacement brought about by seventeenth-century globalization, solastalgia was its twenty-

first-century counterpart.

Once he had a name for the condition, Albrecht set out to record its existence. In April 2003, he returned to the Upper Hunter Valley with a team of social scientists. He conducted interviews with residents, asking them about their families, their houses, and their history in the valley. Meanwhile, his partner, Nick Higginbotham, conducted statistical research. Higginbotham used the Environmental Distress Scale to compare the health of Hunter Valley residents to that of a control community that had not been exposed to mining. He mailed out surveys to residents in both communities asking them to rate the frequency of environmental disturbances they had witnessed near their homes; how threatened they felt by them; the emotional, economic, and physical impacts they felt; the actions they’d taken to address the situation; how much they trusted government and industry information; and the degree to which loss of place, or solastalgia, had affected them. People living in the hardest-hit mining areas reported more environmental disturbances, higher levels of threat, and greater emotional and physical effects than the control group. Most important, though, they reported acute feelings of solastalgia, agreeing strongly with phrases like “I miss having the sense of peace and quiet I once enjoyed in this place” or “I am ashamed of the way this area looks now.” After nearly two years of exhaustive qualitative and quantitative research, Albrecht and his team were able to define solastalgia as not just a word or a concept but an empirical reality.

Albrecht’s study on solastalgia was the first of its kind. Since then, additional research has demonstrated a connection between environmental and psychological distress. Meanwhile, the word has traveled far; Albrecht has sparked something of a movement in art, politics, and philosophy, as more and more people search for a way to describe their feelings of grief and loss about climate change and environmental destruction. In October 2018, when I spoke to Albrecht, he was in Sweden, talking with the Sami about the effects of forest fires on their land and psyches. Albrecht worries about his fame, however. “The fact that the word is gaining traction means we’re in deep shit,” he told me. “I want it removed from the English language as quickly as possible.”

Lise Van Susteren, a practicing clinical psychiatrist in Washington, DC, has developed her own words for climate grief. Van Susteren started reading about the health consequences of climate change in the early aughts. After An Inconvenient Truth came out, she signed up to be a climate educator through Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project. Her scientific training gave her valuable insight into the consequences of climate change, but it also led her to place too much faith in data. “I was unrealistic about the human mind and our capacity to deny,” she told me over the phone. “I honestly thought, We’ll look at where we are, we will see we have to get carbon emissions down to 350 parts per million.” She led classes and waited for change to happen—but things only got worse. “We were not only not bringing numbers down—they were accelerating,” she said.

Van Susteren started having trouble sleeping. After getting into bed and closing her eyes, she would be ambushed by intrusive images. She would see refugees surrounded by barbed wire, animals trapped in the path of a hurricane, people stranded in floodwaters. The worst image was of a child. It wasn’t any child she knew, but a sort of representative for all children. The child looked at Van Susteren and asked the same question again and again: “Why didn’t you do anything?”

As a psychiatrist, Van Susteren recognized her symptoms. The stress, the insomnia, the intrusive thoughts—they read like PTSD. And yet the trauma she was imagining hadn’t happened yet, or at least it hadn’t happened to her. How could she feel trauma before the cause? But her stress was undeniable, and it was debilitating. “You can breeze through the newspaper and try not to read about insect Armageddon, the glacial ice sheets melting, wildfires, climate refugees, and storms,” she said, “but it registers on your psyche. Whether you like it or not, it does.” Van Susteren coined a new term for her condition: pre-traumatic stress disorder.

I have had symptoms of pre-TSD for much of my adult life. When Van Susteren told me about the disorder, I thought of the night I learned about the Permian extinction and the argument I’d had with Chris about his lawn. At the time, I’d just felt frustrated and confused. Now I had a word for these feelings. The sleepless nights, the obsessive YouTubing, the tendency to place huge importance on everyday decisions—they were rooted in a fear of the future. I was picturing all the small decisions across the world and multiplying them by time. I was grieving the future in the present, and—since there were so few people who wanted to talk about it—I was grieving it alone.

If we accept the emergence of solastalgia, pre-traumatic stress disorder, and other climate-induced ills, what’s to be done about them? How do we confront the reality of climate change and convince others to do the same? The environmentalist Alan AtKisson calls this predicament Cassandra’s Dilemma, named after the princess of Troy who appears in Aeschylus’s tragedy Agamemnon. Cassandra is blessed with seeing the future, but her gift is accompanied by a counterbalancing curse: no one believes her prophecies. AtKisson connects the myth to climate action: the more a person knows about environmental destruction, the more they will try to warn others, and the more others will, in fear and defensiveness, resist them.

The environmental movement has been collectively trying to solve this problem for years. Its solution has been to gather more data. It hasn’t worked. In the wake of environmental inaction, many activists have started to shift the emphasis toward emotions, not facts. A key strategy is to name those emotions and normalize them.

To find out more about this approach, I visited the Bureau of Linguistical Reality, in San Francisco, in 2018. The bureau is tucked into a corner of the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. At the time of my visit, elsewhere in the city, indigenous activists were blocking the streets in protest of California governor Jerry Brown’s climate policies. I was there during the Global Climate Action Summit, a convergence of world leaders, politicians, and environmentalist bigwigs determined to compensate for Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords—

a noble goal, but one that many don’t think goes far enough. In a corner of the center, behind a small table, I found Alicia Escott and Heidi Quante, the two founders of the bureau. They were dressed in military greens and covered in patches of the starburst from Carl Sagan’s golden record. Next to the table were posters propped on easels that read: shadowtime; gwilt; casaperdida.

The mission of the bureau is to create a dictionary for the Anthropocene—not a dictionary of scientific terms, but a lexicon of words to describe the destabilizing experience of living through mass climate change. Escott and Quante conceived of the project during an unusually sunny San Francisco winter, when they confessed to each other that they felt joy at the warm weather (they could wear sundresses) but guilty about what it meant. They wanted a word for that feeling, something that captured their ambivalence. They came up with psychic corpus dissonance. Other words include ennuipocalypse: the idea that the end of the world might not be a Hollywood Armageddon, but mundane and almost normal; and NonnaPaura, the desire to have children or grandchildren, mixed with a fear about the world they’ll inherit. The bureau’s mission combines philosophy (because words forge the way we see the world) and politics (because new words create new possibilities for action). But it’s also absurd: the military uniforms, the game of making up new words to describe highly specific feelings, the free patches they give out. They look like experts from another planet, reporting on their interactions with sentient life on Earth. The strangeness invites curiosity, said Quante. Instead of throwing data at people, the bureau invites the public to reflect, feel, and collaborate. “I noticed that the approaches of the environmental groups weren’t effective with people who didn’t already agree with them,” she said. “So obviously talking at people and telling them what to do doesn’t work.”

When I walked in, I noticed that Escott and Quante had placed a sign near the museum entrance announcing Word needed followed by a definition: The misdiagnosis that an individual’s depression or mental illness is derived from something wrong with them personally, when the depression may actually be induced by living in a society that is ill or broken. The bureau doesn’t usually provide a definition in need of a word, but so many people had talked to them about this feeling that they’d decided to crowdsource it.

The definition immediately made me think of Chris. Escott and Quante related to it too. After the failed Copenhagen climate talks in 2009, Escott hid out in her studio in the Castro, broke and devastated, and started a strange experiment: she wrote letters to extinct animals like the desert rat kangaroo, which disappeared from Australia in 1994, and filled the animals in on what they had missed in the intervening years. Quante told me that one of her earliest memories was learning that so many things around her were alive—the trees, the grass, the frogs. It terrified her to realize the harm she was capable of. One day, after it had rained, her mother made her walk along a worm-strewn sidewalk, and she screamed as she was dragged along. “We’re killing them!” she said. “We’re killing them!”

When Quante debuted the bureau at the Paris climate meetings, a woman from Haiti approached her, almost in tears. The fact that other people were talking about feeling grief, the woman said, made her feel less isolated and crazy. An environmental lawyer came by later to look for a place to sit. When he learned what the bureau does, he confessed to Quante that his job weighed on him heavily. Every day, he told her, he went to court to fight against environmental destruction, but as a lawyer, his only tools of expression were the languages of rationality and law. He could never say what he actually felt. As he spoke to Quante, he began to cry. “No one has ever asked me what I felt about this before,” he said.

“There’s such a suppression,” Quante told me. “Our artwork is showing that almost everyone is experiencing solastalgia. A lot of people are depressed. They’re not alone.” Quante believes that this shift to people realizing they are part of a greater collective can lead to social change.

Throughout the day I visited the bureau, people walked up to the table with looks of excitement or relief. “I’ve got a word for that depression thing,” said a young woman. “How about socioppression?” It was clunky (many of the bureau’s words are), but Escott and Quante were game to discuss it. The woman, an actor, told them that her job was to make people feel things. Why, she wondered, would we stamp out feelings about the most devastating problem? “It’s like people create all these diagnoses to diminish the larger existential reality.” She paused, thinking about what she had just said. “What about distrance?” she said. “Like a mix of distance and distraction?”

The rest of the day brought requests for a word describing the jaded feeling of constantly receiving bad news; a word for experiencing generations of environmental trauma; a word for the way that ash and smoke from a forest fire turn the sky purple and the trees a bluish gray. (Two months later, when California was engulfed by forest fires, the bureau created another word, brokenrecordrecordbreaking, for the feeling of déjà vu experienced when reading that this year’s catastrophe records are the highest ever.) One woman approached the table uncertainly. She had a bristle of gray hair and Hello Kitty tattoos on her arms, and she wanted to suggest the word eco-pooper. “You know,” she says, “like that person who brings up some depressing environmental thing every time you talk?” Then she turned to me and asked what word I would invent. I wondered if I should tell her that I was an eco-pooper: her worst nightmare. Instead, I said, “Maybe something about repressing the desire to talk about climate change at parties.” She looked at me and shrugged. “Well, yeah, no one likes that. Like, The world is ending. Pass the cheese puffs!”

Today, Chris lives in a gingerbread-style house in downtown Salt Lake City with his wife and two kids. It’s a life his Davis self never could have imagined. But although his life may look normal, he’s still devastated by the state of the planet. When I called him in late 2018, he was stewing. He’d just been to Utah Valley University, in Orem, to see a mutual friend of ours named Ben present his latest climate research. After the panel, while they were talking about some of the grim news, Ben declared that he considered himself an optimist, and that if Chris kept talking pessimistically, things would never change. “He didn’t say I was factually wrong,” Chris said. “Just that I felt wrong.” Chris likened optimism to a boat headed toward the edge of Niagara Falls. “It’s not the guy who says we’re fine that changes the boat’s course,” he said. “It’s the guy who says we’re all going to die.”

Chris acknowledged that this quality doesn’t make him easy to be around. Last year, he informed his ethics class that the amount of carbon in the atmosphere was at 400 ppm, and that there was no hope of getting it down to 350. In the back of the class, a student started crying. “If I didn’t have hope, how could I live?” she asked. Chris had an urge to say: Exactly. But he felt bad about making her cry.

Chris’s depression sometimes makes his life feel unbearable, but attempts to feel better don’t sit well with him, either. He keeps busy writing papers, attending activist events, staging protests. He often feels like a failure. He suffers from nearly constant intrusive thoughts. When he goes to bed, he sees the faces of billions of animals—bears, mountain lions, factory-farmed cows and pigs—all suffering, all staring at him. He tries to imagine what extinction must be like. “There’s starvation involved and there’s horror and betrayal and there’s no recourse,” he told me. “You just have to go on until you die. Until you’re all dead.”

After I hung up the phone, I thought about Chris for days. I thought about his feeling of never being or doing enough—I both admired and worried about it. I thought about his insistence on pessimism in the face of the pressure to be optimistic. Research favors the optimists, I had to admit. Most humans respond better to manageable, hopeful amounts of information tied to concrete, doable actions. But I wondered if, in the end, what is important isn’t choosing optimism or pessimism but honesty with oneself. It seemed to me that for his entire life Chris has battled for the space to vent his rage and anger and sorrow, to be given a place to grieve and people to grieve with. And this, more than anything else, is what I needed in him and what he needed in me.

I thought about this again one bitter day in January 2019, while lying on my back on the Rockefeller Center skating rink in New York City. That morning, I’d met up with a dozen activists from a climate group called Extinction Rebellion, and we’d laced up our skates, held hands, and wobbled onto the ice. At exactly 2:30 p.m., we dropped to the rink and formed the image of an hourglass. Above us, another protester climbed from the mezzanine onto the giant golden Prometheus statue and hung a banner from its arms reading Climate Change = Mass murder. On Fifth Avenue, more protesters blocked traffic; others staged die-ins representing the victims of the climate crisis. After five years of paralysis, I was back. I was still afraid: afraid of more burnout, afraid of caring, afraid it wasn’t enough. But I’d come because I’d read the group’s principles. Number one: This is an emergency. Tell the truth.

We lay on the ice for half an hour while tourists from Texas, Florida, and California skated around us. As I shivered, I thought about climate grief. Ever since I’d learned about climate change, I’d wanted to believe that people could stop it. In order to stop it, I knew we’d have to be honest with ourselves about it—to have the courage to face its true size and consequences. But all the advice I’d ever gotten, all the social cues, all the role-modeling, had told me to lie and pretend. For years, I had wanted to find a place where I could be honest, because I wanted to believe that we—humans, people, myself—might still be able to act meaningfully in the face of our own extinction.

Around the time of the protest, I told Chris about the bureau’s dictionary for the Anthropocene and asked what word he would add. Chris teaches philosophy of language, and I knew he’d be into it. But he got even more excited than I’d expected, rattling off a long list of possibilities. Ultimately, he settled on one to describe both others and himself. He called it ignore-ance, or “returning from a state of consciousness to a willed state of not knowing.” That’s where he was now, he said, and where so many people insist on being. He was surviving, but he didn’t admire himself. “You do it by pretending,” he said, as if teaching me how. “You pretend that this life is OK, that college football is fun, that driving is normal. You pretend to justify living a lie.”

Chris feels daily that he’s not doing enough. In reality, he is accomplishing more than almost anyone I know. But he’s had to make certain concessions in order to stay alive. He’s happier now that he’s not sleeping in the hills outside of Davis, subsisting on boiled wheat and self-loathing, but that also means he spends more time in a place of willed not-knowing. In the language of Bruce Levine, the dissident psychologist, Chris is sick not because he is inherently anxious or depressed, but because he lives in a sick society in which both his belonging and survival depend on inaction.

Maybe the word we need is not one for a sickness. Maybe we need a word for a difficult truth: that when the world is ending, our health depends on closing ourselves off to awareness of this fact. Where you choose to draw your boundaries is arbitrary, not rational. If you draw them wide—if you include trees and refugees and animals and whole nations—you will be sick from overwhelm and will be seen as crazy. But if you draw them narrowly, you’ll suppress more and admire yourself less—which is its own sort of sickness.

I decided to ask Chris. Was he sick? He thought about it for a long time. “I don’t know,” he said finally. “But I know this: if your heart is breaking, you’re on my team.”

"One in three companies have put at least 75% of their workforce on furlough, and now the government is reducing its payout from 80% to 22% of full time work, giving false hope to employees who may not be kept on.",https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/explainers-52135342,"Job Support Scheme: How do new post-furlough changes work? By Eleanor Lawrie

BBC News Published duration 6 days ago Related Topics Job Support Scheme (JSS)

Firms struggling with Covid restrictions are to get more government support, to help them keep on workers.

Staff at pubs and restaurants hit by new rules in tier two areas are among those who could benefit.

The changes are now part of the government's Job Support Scheme (JSS), which replaces furlough on 1 November.

What will I be paid if my workplace has to close?

Some businesses in tier three ""very high risk areas"" have to close - including pubs and bars that don't serve substantial meals, and betting shops.

Workers will be paid 67% of their wages - up to a maximum of £2,100 a month - through the JSS.

You must be off work for a minimum of seven days to be eligible. Your employer doesn't have to pay towards your salary.

Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire will all have tier three measures by Saturday 24 October.

What if work is open but not busy?

Areas like London and Essex are now under ''high alert'' tier two rules. Places like pubs and cafes have been less busy because household mixing indoors is banned.

Firms like these, which can open but only have enough work for employees to return part-time, can also get help under the JSS, regardless of which tier they are in.

Staff have to be paid by their employer to work a minimum 20% of their hours per month.

The employer must pay an extra 4% of total wages to cover some of the hours not worked, and the government will pay 49% of the total salary to cover hours not worked.

So, overall the worker would get at least 73% of salary. The maximum contribution the government will make is £1,541.75.

To qualify, you must have been on your work's payroll since 23 September.

You can be moved on and off the scheme, or work different hours, but each working arrangement must cover at least seven days.

You cannot be made redundant or put on notice until after the JSS grant stops being claimed.

Employers will be reimbursed by the government for its share after salaries have been paid.

The scheme will run for six months from 1 November, and then be reviewed.

A grant available to self-employed people affected by coronavirus has also been doubled to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant of £3,750 over a three-month period.

What else can firms get?

Extra help is also being offered to firms, depending on which tier they are in.

Tier three businesses qualify for a grant of up to £3,000 a month if they are affected by the restrictions, whether they are open or closed

Hospitality, accommodation and leisure firms in tier two and three areas will be eligible for a backdated grant of up to £2,100 per month, on top of any other funding. Devolved nations will be given the equivalent funding for other nations, under the Barnett Formula.

The UK government will also give firms:

£1,000 for every furloughed employee kept on until at least the end of January

£1,500 for every out-of-work 16-24 year-old given a ''high quality'' six-month work placement

£2,000 for every under-25 apprentice taken on until the end of January, or £1,500 for over-25s

What is the Job Support Scheme replacing?

The Job Support Scheme replaces furlough, which was designed to help people who couldn't do their jobs and prevent mass redundancies during lockdown.

Under the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, workers placed on leave received 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month."
The five real conspiracies you need to know about,https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-10-02/the-five-real-conspiracies-you-need-to-know-about/,"While millions of people are spellbound by false conspiracy theories, the real conspiracies that are wrecking our world go about their business unheeded. Here are five genuine threats that everyone should know about—and take action on.

The world is awash in a deluge of dangerous conspiracy theories. Most notoriously, the bizarre QAnon fantasy postulates that a global child sex-trafficking ring is being run by liberal, Satan-worshiping pedophiles whose plot will be uncovered by President Donald Trump on a “day of reckoning” involving mass arrests. This surreal mass delusion is not the only one infecting millions of people around the world. Earlier this year, the Plandemic conspiracy video went viral on social media, instilling disinformation into millions of minds about Covid-19, falsely alleging that it was a hoax perpetrated by big business for the sake of profiteering by selling mass vaccinations.

One of the most harmful results of these bogus conspiracy theories is that they help deflect people’s attention from the real conspiracies that are systematically damaging billions of people around the world, destroying the living Earth, and—if left unchecked—may drive our entire civilization to collapse. These are the conspiracies everyone needs to know about. Unlike the QAnon and Plandemic nonsense, they are real. The facts about them are in the open, yet these lethal conspiracies hide in plain sight, flagrantly going about their destructive activities while millions of people have their attention diverted toward pernicious fictions.

Let’s take a look at five of the most damaging conspiracies out there. As you consider them, I invite you to ponder how it is that, while our mass media focuses attention on imaginary conspiracies, the real ones that threaten every one of us are barely even discussed.

1. Conspiracy to turn the world into a giant marketplace for the benefit of the wealthy elite

Back in 1947, as the world was rebuilding from the destruction of the Second World War, a few dozen free-market ideologues met in a luxury Swiss resort to form the Mont Pelerin Society—an organization devoted to spreading the ideology of neoliberalism throughout the world. Their ideas—that the free market should dominate virtually all aspects of society, that regulations should be dismantled, and that individual liberty should eclipse all other considerations of fairness, equity, or community welfare—were considered fanatical at the time. Over three decades, though, financed by wealthy donors, they assiduously expanded their plot for global domination, establishing networks of academics, businessmen, economists, journalists, and politicians, in global centers of power.

When the stagflation crisis of the 1970s threw classic Keynesian economics into disrepute, their moment of opportunity arrived. By 1985, with free market disciples Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher entrenched in power, they initiated a campaign to systematically transform virtually all aspects of life into an unrestrained marketplace, where everything could be bought and sold to the highest bidder, subject to no moral scruple. They crippled trade unions, tore up social safety nets, reduced tax rates for the wealthy, eliminated regulations, and instituted a massive transfer of wealth from society at large to the uber-elite. Every time a new crisis occurred of their own making, such as the Great Recession of 2008, they took advantage of the mayhem they caused to double down on their power, and extend their reach even further, bringing the ideology of the marketplace into domains, such as education, law enforcement, or wilderness preserves, that had previously been considered sacrosanct.

The Neoliberal conspiracy has succeeded in transferring massive wealth to the uber-elite

With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, this conspiracy has found yet another opportunity to squeeze wealth from the bulk of society into the hands of the few. In the United States, since the pandemic began, while 200,000 Americans have died from coronavirus and more than 50 million have lost their jobs, the collective wealth of this country’s billionaires has soared 29% to $3.8 trillion. Jeff Bezos alone could give every Amazon employee $105,000 and still be as wealthy as he was before coronavirus hit.

2. Conspiracy by transnational corporations to turn billions of people into addicts

In the 1920s, two ruthless men laid out a sinister scheme to gain control of the minds of Americans. Their plan? To identify people’s deeply buried needs and use subtle messaging to manipulate them into doing whatever they wanted without realizing it—even at the cost of their health and well-being. One of them, Edward Bernays, was Sigmund Freud’s nephew and used his uncle’s insights into the subconscious to develop his new methods. Their goal was to turn normal working Americans into manic consumers, training them to desire an ever-increasing amount of goods, and thereby converting their life’s energy into profit for American corporations. “We must shift America from a needs to a desires culture,” declared Bernays’ partner, Paul Mazur. “People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. We must shape a new mentality. Man’s desires must overshadow his needs.”

In 1928, Bernays proudly described how his techniques for mental manipulation had already permitted a small elite to control the minds of the American population:

The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government that is the true ruling power of this country. ​We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. . . . In almost every act of our daily lives. . . we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons . . . who pull the wires which control the public mind.

Since then, this conspiracy has succeeded beyond its instigators’ wildest dreams. Corporations have perfected the technique of mind control by tweaking core human instincts that originally evolved to support our ancestors’ flourishing in hunter-gatherer bands—such as the desire for status or fear of exclusion—for their nefarious purposes.

Corporate predators have learned that the most valuable population to ensnare are children. In the sinister words of chief executive Wayne Chilicki, “When it comes to targeting kid consumers, we at General Mills . . . believe in getting them early and having them for life.” Children in the Global South are turned into junk food addicts with the same callous contempt that factory farms turn their animals into chicken nuggets. Half of the children in south Asia are now either undernourished or overweight, conditioned by pervasive advertising to spend what little money they have on the empty calories of junk food.

A new generation of mind controllers are now using sophisticated data mining technologies to inject their power even deeper into our minds. At the ominously named Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, a modern-day Bernays named B. J. Fogg has taught budding entrepreneurs how to use “hot triggers” such as thumbs-up signs and “Like” statistics to activate short hits of dopamine in our brains that literally get us addicted to our screens. With social media now infiltrating every aspect of many teenagers’ lives, the power of predatory corporate advertising to control their minds for profit has become even more formidable. In 2017, a leaked document revealed Facebook boasting to advertisers how they can identify in real time when teenagers feel “insecure” and “worthless,” and would be most susceptible to a “confidence boost.”

3. Conspiracy to plunder the Global South for the benefit of the Global North

Ever since Portuguese and Spanish explorers set sail in the fifteenth century on a quest for wealth and power, a small population of white Europeans have conspired to use their technological advantage to despoil, plunder, and exploit the rest of the world’s wealth for their own benefit. With the Treaty of Saragossa in 1529, Spain and Portugal carved up the non-European continents between them for conquest and booty. After the Industrial Revolution, the countries of northern Europe took over the plot for global supremacy, devastating the lives of tens of millions of Africans mercilessly chained and shipped as slaves to the colonies.

After the abolition of the slave trade, the brutal exploitation continued through an international system of indentured labor. Having destroyed their livelihood in their native countries, European potentates transported more than 60 million desperate workers from India, China, and the Pacific islands to territories where they were needed, in what was frequently referred to as the “new form of slavery.” This vast global scheme of human trafficking was promoted by colonial magnates such as Cecil Rhodes who declared: “We must find new lands from which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap slave labour that is available from the natives of the colonies. The colonies would also provide a dumping ground for the surplus goods produced in our factories.”

In more recent times, the plot continues in different guises. During the decades after the Second World War, Global South leaders who demanded a fair role in the economic system were systematically deposed in coups arranged by U.S., British, and French militaries. In a vast loan sharking scheme, countries impoverished by colonialism then racked up unsustainable debts forced on them by Global North banks. When they couldn’t pay them back without bankrupting their nations, they were coerced into so-called “structural adjustment programs” which opened their labor markets and natural resources to further plunder by the North’s transnational corporations. The World Bank, IMF, and World Trade Organization are all controlled by a few wealthy nations that set the terms for international trade, with the result that through a combination of illicit financial flows, debt interest payments, and profit repatriation, wealth continues to flow from the South to the North at the rate of about $3 trillion per year.

The income gap between Global North and South has quadrupled since 1960. Data from World Bank.

4. Conspiracy to hide the effects of climate breakdown for corporate profit

For over fifty years, fossil fuel executives have known about the reality of human-induced climate change, yet they spent most of that time deliberately concealing their knowledge and obfuscating public discussion on the topic so they could rake in trillions of dollars in profit. In 1968, the Stanford Research Institute alerted the American Petroleum Institute—the national trade association that represents America’s oil and natural gas industry—to the fact that CO2 emissions were accumulating in the atmosphere, and could reach 400 parts per million by 2000. Their report warned that rising CO2 levels would result in melting ice caps, rising seas, and serious environmental damage worldwide. Exxon scientists studied the issue further, reporting to management in 1977 that there was “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for CO2 increases. In an internal Exxon memo in 1981, scientists raised the alarm that the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population).”

Exxon—and the other fossil fuel companies—knew their actions would lead to climate breakdown, and instead of trying to solve the problem, they lied to the public to hide their misdeeds. Following the example of the tobacco industry, which had already condemned millions to early deaths through cynical deception, they embarked on a concerted strategy to dupe the public by paying fake experts to publish papers; cherry picking selective data to support false conclusions; and sow their own wild conspiracy theories to deflect attention from their crimes.

As a result of their immoral plot, the world is now facing a dire climate emergency. If the fossil fuel companies had confronted the issue honestly from the outset, there could have been a managed transition to renewable energy over decades, causing little disruption and saving millions of lives through reduced pollution. Instead, it will now take an immediate global mobilization to avoid a 2° C rise in temperature over preindustrial levels. The world is currently on track for more than a 3° C rise this century, with the high likelihood of stumbling into a tipping point cascade that quickly leads to a three- and four-degree world—one that becomes rapidly unrecognizable, with the Amazon rainforest turning into searing desert; coastal cities inundated by flooding; super-hurricanes tearing the windows out of skyscrapers; persistent massive droughts and famine across the world; and hundreds of millions of desperate climate refugees.

Meanwhile, by putting billions of human lives in jeopardy, the four biggest fossil fuel companies—ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, and BP—have made $2 trillion in profits since they began their campaign of lies in 1990.

5. Conspiracy to grow the global economy indefinitely, while killing most of life on Earth and risking the collapse of civilization.

In a barely noticed footnote to the daily news, the World Wildlife Fund recently released a shocking report revealing a devastating 68% worldwide decline in animal populations in the past fifty years. Even this dismal news hides more gut-wrenching statistics, such as the 84% decline in amphibians, reptiles, and fishes, or the 94% decline in animal populations in South America.

This is just the latest bulletin marking the demise of nature as it succumbs to the relentless growth of human economic activity across the world. Three-quarters of all land has been appropriated for human purposes, either turned into farmland, covered by concrete, or flooded by reservoirs. Three-quarters of rivers and lakes are used for crop or livestock cultivation, with many of the world’s greatest rivers, such as the Ganges, Yangtze, or Nile, no longer reaching the sea. Half of the world’s forests and wetlands have disappeared—the Amazon rainforest alone is vanishing at the rate of an acre every second.

Meanwhile, the world’s Gross Domestic Product is forecast to nearly triple by the middle of this century, by which time it’s estimated that 5 billion people will be facing water shortages, 95% of the Earth’s arable land will be degraded—and there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. It’s been estimated by leading experts that, by the end of this century, half of the world’s estimated 8 million species will be extinct or at the brink of extinction unless humanity changes its ways. These depredations, combined with climate breakdown, are believed by an increasing number of analysts to spell the likely collapse of modern civilization.

The underlying cause of this headlong rush to catastrophe is our society’s obsession with economic growth as the sole criterion for measuring success. A dangerous myth of “green growth” propagated by techno-optimists argues that through technological innovation, GDP can become “decoupled” from resource use and carbon emissions, permitting limitless growth on a finite planet. This has been shown to be nothing but a fantasy: it hasn’t happened so far, and even the most wildly aggressive assumptions for greater efficiency lead to unsustainable consumption of global resources.

So who, in this case, are the conspirators? If you’re living a normal life in an affluent country, you don’t need to look further than the mirror. The wealthy OECD nations, with only 18% of the global population, account for 74% of global GDP, and the richest 10% of people are responsible for more than half the world’s carbon emissions.

Those of us who continue to benefit from the inequities dealt us by the global system, and aren’t actively engaged in curbing it, are like a few shipwrecked survivors on a gilded lifeboat kicking others desperately scrambling for life into the ocean to protect their own safety and comfort. We may not be actively kicking their knuckles, but by allowing this reckless system of unsustainable growth to continue, we’re implicitly making the same choice.

So, the next time someone tells you to “do your research” on their new conspiracy theory, please point them to the real conspiracies that are threatening life on this beautiful but troubled planet. The good news is that, since they’re real conspiracies, there is something we can do about them. We can vote in politicians that promise to peel back the neoliberal nightmare; advocate for curbs on predatory corporate activities; support the Global South in changing the terms of international trade; declare a Climate Emergency in our community to turn around carbon emissions; and become active in the movement to transform our global society to an Ecological Civilization—one that is based on life-affirming principles rather than accumulating wealth.

"""Nobody is arguing about whether the temperature increase will be less than 2 degrees. We’re arguing about the high end"" | ScienceNews",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios,"Earth’s climatic future is uncertain, but the world needs to prepare for change.

Enter climate simulations, which re-create the physical interactions between land, sea and sky using well-known physical laws and equations. Such models can look into the past and reconstruct ancient ice ages or hothouse worlds with the help of data gleaned from rocks and ice cores.

But climate scientists also use these simulations to envision a range of different possible futures, particularly in response to climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions. These Choose Your Own Adventure–type scenarios aim to predict what’s to come as a result of different emissions levels over the next few decades. That means putting upper and lower boundaries on answers to questions such as: How hot will it get? How high will the seas rise?

The good news is that climate simulations are getting better at re-creating even the subtlest aspects of climate change, such as the complicated physics of clouds, the impact of aerosols and the capacity for the ocean to absorb heat from the atmosphere.

But there’s also bad news: More information doesn’t always mean more clarity. And that is now feeding into uncertainty about just how bad the “worst-case scenario” might be for Earth’s climate.

Five years ago, the probable worst-case climate scenarios were worrisome enough. Under a so-called “business-as-usual” scenario, in which humankind takes no action to abate greenhouse gas emissions, by 2100 the planet was projected to warm between 2.6 degrees and 4.8 degrees Celsius relative to the average Earth temperature from 1986 to 2005 (SN: 4/13/14). Global mean sea level was thought likely to increase by up to a meter in that same scenario, according to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

But the newest generation of climate models suggests Earth’s climate may be even more sensitive to very high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide than once thought. And that, in turn, is increasing projections of just how hot it could get.

“We’re having discussions of ‘Do we believe these models?’” says Andrew Gettelman, a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, in Boulder, Colo.

That’s because the simulations use the same equations to look at past and future climate conditions. And many simulations still struggle to re-create accurately the climate of very warm time periods in the past, such as the Eocene Epoch (SN: 11/3/15). As the world gets hotter, it turns out, the uncertainties start to ramp up. “Nobody is arguing about whether [the temperature increase will be] less than 2 degrees,” Gettelman says. “We’re arguing about the high end.”

Turning up the heat

The first whiff that something very strange was going on with the latest models came in March, at a meeting in Barcelona of scientists and modelers working on next-gen climate simulations. Many of the simulations are destined to be incorporated into the next IPCC assessment report, the first part of which is scheduled for release in April 2021.

All of the simulations include estimates of something called equilibrium climate sensitivity, or ECS. That basically means how Earth’s future climate is expected to respond to a new normal — specifically, an atmosphere that contains twice as much carbon dioxide as during preindustrial times.

A similar trend is shown by several well-known simulations, developed by teams at NCAR, the U.S. Department of Energy, England’s Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter and the Paris-based Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, or IPSL. In those models, the ECS was higher, meaning the Earth was more sensitive to carbon dioxide, than in previous model generations. If real, that suggests that the gases can exert even more influence on Earth’s atmosphere than thought. Ultimately, that could mean that temperatures could get hotter than even the highest previous projections suggested.

In September, scientists with IPSL and the French National Center for Scientific Research, or CNRS, also in Paris, went public with their simulations. Based on projections from two separate climate models, the teams reported that average global warming by 2100 could climb as high as 6 to 7 degrees C (or about 11 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit) relative to preindustrial times.

Like many new-gen climate simulations, the two French models feature finer-scale resolution and better representations of real-world conditions than past simulations. When tested against present-day climate observations, the new simulations also do a better job of reproducing those observations, says CNRS climatologist Olivier Boucher.

But the high ECS remains a surprise. “Our [model] is better” in terms of the physics, Boucher says. “But it doesn’t automatically translate into having more confidence for the future projections.”

This ECS conundrum, which so many of the models still show, came up again November 21 at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences atmospheric and climate science board in Washington, D.C. The likeliest cause of the high ECS, Gettelman said at the meeting, was in how much the models estimate that clouds will enhance warming (SN: 3/22/14). Among other factors, how high the clouds are in the atmosphere matters: Lower-altitude clouds can reflect sunlight back into space, while higher-altitude clouds can trap heat. Gettelman and his colleagues also discussed the significance of clouds in ECS modeling in July in Geophysical Research Letters.

“Clouds at high latitudes look like they’re quite important,” Gettelman says. The region over the Southern Ocean is one of particular interest, but there are now studies afoot to examine the effects of high-altitude clouds in the Arctic as well as lower-altitude clouds in the tropics.

A new paradigm

Puzzling out how to discuss the high-ECS models will likely be a headache for the authors of the next IPCC report. The landscape of climate simulations is getting more complicated in other ways as well.

For the 2014 IPCC report, climate modelers also participated in the fifth iteration of a project to set standards and scenarios for climate projections. That project is called the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, or CMIP5 for short.

CMIP5’s future projections were organized using a concept called “representative concentration pathways,” or RCPs. Each pathway outlined a possible climate future based on the physical effects of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, as they linger in the atmosphere and trap radiation from the sun. An Earth in which greenhouse gas emissions are dramatically and swiftly curbed was represented by a scenario called RCP 2.6. The business-as-usual scenario was known as RCP 8.5.

The IPCC’s upcoming sixth assessment report will rely on projections from CMIP6, the new more sensitive models. And in them, RCPs are out, and a new paradigm called “shared socioeconomic pathways,” or SSPs, is in.

The latest generation of climate models, known collectively as CMIP6 models, include projections that take into account possible socioeconomic changes, as well as how different concentrations of greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere. Those socioeconomic changes include trends in economic growth and technological development, particularly in rapidly growing cities such as Mumbai (shown). akksht/Shutterstock

While RCP projections are based solely on how different concentrations of gases warm the atmosphere, SSP projections also incorporate societal shifts, such as changes in demographics, urbanization, economic growth and technological development. By tracking how such changes can affect future climate change, scientists hope that SSPs can also help nations better assess how to meet their own emissions target pledged under the Paris Agreement (SN: 12/12/15).

Data drive

Human behavior isn’t the only source of uncertainty when it comes to envisioning worst-case scenarios. Scientists also are wrestling with simulating the complicated physical interactions of ice and ocean and atmosphere, particularly as temperatures continue to rise.

“Most oceans have air on top of them, and [some] oceans have ice on top of them. And the ice is moving, the ice is interacting. It’s a very difficult thing,” says Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State.

Climate models are just now getting to the point where they can reproduce many of these interactions by “coupling” them together into one simulation, Alley says. Doing so is key to accurately projecting possible futures: Such coupled simulations reveal how these interactions feed into one another, raising the potential for even higher temperatures or even higher seas.

But numerous sources of possible uncertainty remain when it comes to anticipating the so-called worst-case scenario. For example, how fast the seas will rise is linked to how quickly the great ice sheets blanketing Greenland and Antarctica will lose ice to the ocean, through melting or collapse (SN: 9/25/19).

Climate simulations are still not reproducing that melting well, even in the IPCC’s special report on climate change’s impacts on ice and oceans released in October 2019. That’s partly because scientists don’t fully understand how the ice responds to climate change, says glaciologist Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine. “We’re making progress,” he says, “but we are not there.”

One of the largest uncertainties is how warming oceans can interact with the vast underbellies of glaciers fringing the ice sheets, eroding them, Rignot says. To identify how such erosion might occur requires detailed bathymetry maps, charts of the seafloor that can reveal deep channels that allow warmer ocean water to sneak into fjords and eat away at the glaciers (SN: 4/3/18). He and his colleagues have been creating some of those maps for Greenland.

New maps of the bathymetry, or seafloor depth, around Greenland are helping scientists see where warm ocean waters may speed the melting of glaciers. In this region of western Greenland, the pink regions represent the fastest-retreating glaciers. Bathymetry is shown on a scale from deepest (in blue) to shallowest (white). L. An et al/Remote Sensing 2019

Scientists also are trying to get boots-on-the-ground data to tackle other uncertainties, such as how warming can change the behavior of the ice sheets themselves as they stretch, bend and slide across the ground. In 2018, an international collaboration of scientists began a five-year project to study the breakup of the Florida-sized Thwaites Glacier in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in real time. Warm ocean waters are thinning the glacier, which supports the ice sheet like a buttress, slowing the flow of ice toward the ocean. Thwaites is likely to collapse, possibly within the next few decades.

And there are other processes not yet included in the CMIP models that could send ice tumbling rapidly into the sea: Meltwater seeps through cracks and crevasses to the base of the ice sheet, lubricating its slide from land to ocean. Meltwater can also refreeze into solid, impermeable slabs that can speed up the flow of newer meltwater into the ocean (SN: 9/18/19). Perhaps most frighteningly, some researchers have suggested that future warming could cause Antarctica’s giant, steep ice cliffs to suddenly lose large chunks of ice to the ocean, rapidly raising sea levels (SN: 2/6/19).

There’s a good reason why current climate models don’t include the ice cliff hypothesis, Alley says. “The best models, the ones that you can have the most faith that they’re reconstructing what’s happened recently, generally do not spend a lot of effort on breaking things off,” he says. The problem isn’t in simulating the physics of ice bits breaking off, it’s in simulating exactly which ice shelves will break off — and when. That makes the potential error of simulating those processes very large.

“That’s a lot of the tension in the community right now,” Alley adds. “How to deal with this is still proving very difficult.”

The IPCC’s 2019 special report noted the ice cliff hypothesis, but considered it extremely unlikely. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible, Alley says — or that it hasn’t happened in the past. Evidence from ocean sediments reveals that giant icebergs have broken away from continent-based cliffs and melted out at sea in the past. If Thwaites glacier retreats all the way to Antarctica’s interior, ongoing calving could create massive cliffs twice as high and 10 times as wide as any observed in Greenland, he noted in December at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in San Francisco.

The IPCC is “assuming we’ll get lucky and it won’t happen,” Alley said. But the ocean sediment data raises “really serious questions about that assumption.”

Gettelman, meanwhile, cautions that the lingering uncertainty in future projections does not mean the world should wait to see what happens or for scientists to figure it out. “It really means we need to do something soon,” he says. Whether the high temperature or sea level rise projections turn out to be real or not, “it’s still pretty bad.”"
The Pacific Ocean is so acidic that it's dissolving Dungeness crabs' shells,https://www.cnn.ph/world/2020/1/28/pacific-ocean-more-acidic-.html,"(CNN) –The Pacific Ocean is becoming more acidic, and the cash-crabs that live in its coastal waters are some of its first inhabitants to feel its effects.

The Dungeness crab is vital to commercial fisheries in the Pacific Northwest, but lower pH levels in its habitat are dissolving parts of its shell and damaging its sensory organs, a new study found.

Their injuries could impact coastal economies and forebode the obstacles in a changing sea. And while the results aren't unexpected, the study's authors said the damage to the crabs is premature: The acidity wasn't predicted to damage the crabs this quickly.

""If the crabs are affected already, we really need to make sure we pay much more attention to various components of the food chain before it is too late,"" said study lead author Nina Bednarsek, a senior scientist with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project.

The findings were published this month in the journal Science of the Total Environment and funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency studies ocean acidification and how changing pH levels are impacting coasts.

How the ocean acidifies

The ocean is acidifying because it's absorbing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which lowers pH levels in the water.

Ocean acidification changes the coasts, releasing excess nutrient that can create algae blooms and increasing sea temperatures and salinity, according to NOAA.

But for crustaceans and coral that rely on carbonate ions, which are less abundant in more acidic waters, to build their shells and coral skeletons, it becomes more difficult to build strong shells.

It's not just crabs, either: Oysters, clams and plankton all rely on the same carbonate ions to strengthen themselves. And humans and sea creatures alike rely on them -- some for food, others for economic security.

How it hurts the crabs

The acidification corroded the young shells of Dungeness crab larvae, which could impair their ability to deter predators and regulate their buoyancy in the water, the researchers said.

The crab larvae that showed signs that their shells were dissolving were smaller than the other larvae, too. This could cause developmental delays that could mess with their rate of maturation.

The tiny hair-like structures crabs use to navigate their environments were damaged by the low pH levels, too -- something scientists had never seen before. Crabs without these mechanoreceptors could move more slowly and have difficulty swimming and searching for food.

""We found dissolution impacts to the crab larvae that were not expected to occur until much later in this century,"" said Richard Feely, study co-author and NOAA senior scientist.

What's next

It's not clear if the same forces could negatively impact adult Dungeness crabs, a question that requires more research. But with the obstacles a crab larvae faces in its early development, it's got less of a chance to survive to adulthood.

As for the acidifying ocean, NOAA proposes two methods of attack: Reducing our overall carbon footprint to reduce the carbon dioxide absorbed by the sea, or teach wildlife and the people who rely on it to adapt to how the sea will change.

NOAA works with local fishery manages and policy makers on conservation efforts -- and researchers hope their findings might be enough to convince them to take immediate action.

Thinking of Buying a Bike? Get Ready for a Very Long Wait --- The United States is facing a shortage of bicycles as anxiety over public transportation and a desire to exercise has sent the demand surging. Whowouldathunk?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/bike-shortage-coronavirus.html,"Some bicycle shops in Brooklyn are selling twice as many bikes as usual and drawing blocklong lines of customers. A chain of shops in Phoenix is selling three times the number of bikes it typically does. A retailer in Washington, D.C., sold all its entry-level bikes by the end of April and has fielded more preorders than ever in its 50-year history.

As the coronavirus pandemic shrinks life in major American cities — limiting pastimes and discouraging use of buses and subways — hundreds of thousands of Americans are flocking to one of the most basic forms of mobility: the bicycle.

In March, nationwide sales of bicycles, equipment and repair services nearly doubled compared with the same period last year, according to the N.P.D. Group, a market research company. Sales of commuter and fitness bikes in the same month increased 66 percent, leisure bikes jumped 121 percent, children’s bikes went up 59 percent and electric bikes rose 85 percent.

By the end of April, many stores and distributors had sold out of low-end consumer bikes. Now, the United States is facing a severe bicycle shortage as global supply chains, disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak, scramble to meet the surge in demand."

911 services suffer nationwide outage as officials race to restore emergency lines,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8783411/911-services-suffer-nationwide-outage-officials-race-restore-emergency-lines.html,"Law enforcement agencies across at least 14 states reported outages of their 911 systems Monday night, with the cause of the widespread disruption currently unclear.

Police departments from Nevada, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Minnesota, tweeted that their 911 phone systems and SMS text services were down shortly after 6:30pm.

Multiple reports also indicated that similar outages occurred throughout Delaware, California, North Carolina, North Dakota, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Washington, as well as Ohio.

The outage impacted all emergency services simultaneously, and 911 services were restored within 30 and 60 minutes for most affected counties.

Police departments from Nevada to Pennsylvania and Arizona to Minnesota, tweeted that their 911 systems were down beginning shortly after 6:30pm

The outages drew immediate scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, the agency responsible for regulating communications services.

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel called for the situation to be investigated immediately.

'The one system we need to work all the time is 911,' she wrote in a tweet. 'The FCC needs to get to the bottom of this now and figure out what is going on.'

The blackout may be linked to a crash of Microsoft 365 services also on Monday night, which restricted user's access to Outlook.com, Office.com, Power Platform, Dynamics365, and Microsoft Teams including Teams Live Event.

Earlier Monday evening, the city of Redmond, Washington, where the software giant is based, noted city phone lines and email accounts were down due to the Microsoft outage, which started after 5pm ET.

On a status page for its cloud services, Microsoft acknowledged the widespread systems issue and said 'Any user may experience access problems for Microsoft 365 services.'

'We're working to identify the full impact and will provide more information shortly,' the company said.

Other suggest the 911 outage may instead be possibly traced back to a fault at a provider of Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)

PSAPs are telephony systems where 911 emergency calls are terminated before reaching the actual emergency service call centers.

The blackout may be linked to a crash of Microsoft 365 services also on Monday night, which restricted user's access to Outlook.com, Office.com, Power Platform, Dynamics365, and Microsoft Teams including Teams Live Event

While the source remains unclear, the Minneapolis Police Department in Minnesota, the Tucson Police Department in Arizona and the Delaware State Police were the first among dozens of agencies to report the outages.

Yavapai, Cochise, and Pima counties, as well as Flagstaff, reported experiencing issues with their 911 emergency lines in Arizona soon after.

In Nevada, the Washoe County Sheriff’s office tweeted that 911 services were down in Washoe County, Reno and Sparks.

The Grass Valley Police Department, located 60 miles Northeast of Sacramento in California reported an outage affecting 'some landlines and cell phones.'

'Please avoid testing your phone’s functionality by calling 911, as our dispatchers are working very hard to try and work through this stressful situation,' a Facebook post from the agency read.

Delaware State Police issued a statement on its website informing residents of the outage and technical issues with their 911 call services.

'Delaware State Police Dispatch Centers are currently experiencing a state wide interruption in service. Anyone attempting to call 911 either by cellphone or landline will experience a busy signal,' the agency said.

Around 30 minutes later, DSP said that their dispatch centers were fully operational again and were now able to receive 911 calls.

Meanwhile, in New York City, the NYPD said it was aware of the outages but said their department has so far been unaffected.

Reduced rainfall and increased water salinity – caused by factors such as rising sea levels and storm surges – could reduce fruit yields by around 21 per cent and 28 per cent respectively if no action is taken to limit the harmful effects of climate change, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine warn.

Grapes, bananas and peanuts would be most affected by drought, while citrus fruits would be most affected by increased water salinity, the study found.

This is the first study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, to look at all the available data on how changes in the climate will affect fruit, seeds and nuts.

The study found that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide – which speeds up the rate of photosynthesis in plants – may lead to improved growth of berries and peanuts."
For the people who still buy into the hopium: Ford government spending $231M to cancel renewable energy projects,https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/11/19/ford-government-spending-231m-to-cancel-renewable-energy-projects/,"The Ford government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars this year to tear down or cancel 751 renewable energy projects around the province, according to documents obtained by CityNews.

“Last year, this government insisted that there would be no cost to cancelling renewable energy projects like the White Pines Wind Farm,” NDP energy critic Peter Tabuns said in the legislature Tuesday.

For the White Pines Wind Farm project in Prince Edward County, the Ontario government is on the hook for an estimated $141 million. The company had signed a 20-year contract to provide the province with renewable energy.

At the project, located two hours east of Toronto, cranes started arriving last month to tear down 100-metre-tall wind turbines that were just built and ready to be switched on. The project was more than a decade in the making and was expected to produce enough energy to power more than 60,000 homes over the length of its contract.

While planning for many of the 751 cancelled projects was well underway, they had not hit key construction milestones. The White Pines project is unique in that construction began in 2017 and the turbines are ready to go.

Outside the town of Milford, nine wind turbines — four fully constructed and five more partially so — are coming down. They are a casualty of the White Pines Wind Project Termination Act, a bill that was passed by Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government just weeks after coming into office.

The government won’t say how much this decommissioning is costing but based on publicly-available documents showing wind power rates, and the project’s generating capacity, CityNews has calculated the province would owe the provider more than $7 million per year of the contract, or just over $141 million over 20 years.

The total cost of all the cancelled renewable energy projects around the provinces is $231 million in 2018-2019, according to the Public Accounts of Ontario.

CityNews has been investigating the costs of decommissioning the projects for weeks. In that time, the government declined to say how much cancelling the White Pines Wind Project would cost taxpayers.

On Tuesday, associate minister of energy Bill Walker would again not confirm the figure in Question Period. Neither would Energy Minister Greg Rickford when he was asked by CityNews earlier this week.

However, an email obtained by CityNews shows that Rickford’s office did confirm to researchers at Queen’s Park that the $231 million was indeed to wind down wind projects. After Question Period on Tuesday, Walker confirmed the figure.

In a one-on-one interview with Rickford, the minister told CityNews that the government’s plan was on track.

“We’re making sure this is entirely consistent with the plan. Sometimes costs upfront will save us down the road — that’s the way we looked at the risks with the 750 projects in total,” he said.

On Tuesday morning, Tabuns likened the cancellations to the Liberal’s cancellation of gas plants in 2010.

“The similarities are striking,” he said. “We saw what the Liberal government did to hydro bills and now Premier Ford is doing the same thing at the same time as he’s letting hydro prices increase.”

Walker responded that White Pines and the other 750 renewable energy projects weren’t necessary.

“Our government has been very clear that it would act to cancel any unnecessary contracts. Ontario has an adequate supply of power right now,” he said.

The government also said the move will eventually save taxpayers money.

“Any of the projects that we cancelled were going to cost our system more money over the long haul than the ratepayer was prepared to pay,” Rickford said. “Extraordinarily high-priced projects, like wind power and solar, were not making us competitive. They needed to be dealt with.”

The government estimates the cancellations will save $790 million in the long term, but couldn’t tell CityNews how much had been spent to date in settling those contracts, despite repeated requests or how much the government was saving by cancelling the White Pines contract.

“Those costs are ongoing, the project is in the process of decommissioning. I don’t see any red flags there,” Rickford told CityNews.

CityNews has confirmed that a negotiated settlement has been reached with WPD Canada, the Mississauga company that owns the White Pines turbines. Company spokesperson Ian McCrae would not disclose details of the settlement between the government and WPD shareholders. In the past, company officials have confirmed that it is upwards of $100 million.

The opposition are also arguing that the PC government — which is currently fighting federal climate legislation in court — has another motivation for cancelling the renewable energy projects.

“The government needs to be honest with people about their politically-motivated campaign of literally ripping turbines out of the ground,” Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner said. “It’s going to cost the government hundreds of millions of dollars. […] I don’t think tax payers want their money wasted.”

“I don’t believe that they don’t have the information about how much its going to cost,” Tabuns said. “But this is a government that never cares particularly about cost when it comes to pursuing their anti-climate change agenda.”

Tabuns believes that, like the Liberal gas plant scandal, this cancellation will result in an investigation by the auditor-general, something CityNews has heard from other sources involved in the file.

“It’s contrary to the interests of people’s pocket books, their lungs and the environment,” he said. “It’s hard for me to believe that the auditor-general won’t follow up.”

“This is heartbreaking.”

When asked about the cost of cancellations, Walker said the White Pines community never wanted the windmills and they were imposed by the previous Liberal government.

“We knew that from Day 1, they knew that from Day 1, and they continued to impose these on unwilling hosts like White Pines was,” he said.

The Milford windmills have been controversial in the community. However, locals whose land the turbines are on are upset to see the project scrapped.

“This is heartbreaking, this has been years and years of building a project that’s being cancelled for absolutely no good reason,” Jennifer Ackerman, who has a turbine on her property, said. “All those years of putting it up to say ‘Oh, its up, and let’s tear it all down.’ The environmental impact of that and nothing gained. Nothing.”

Ackerman is one of several area residents who were heavily lobbying for the turbines, which is located not too far from the shores of Lake Ontario.

“I believe in renewable energy. The science is there, it’s a fact Jack, that we’ve got to get away from fossil fuels and this is the way to do it,” added area resident Anne McIntosh.

Jennifer Ackerman looks at the windmill built on her property in Milford that will soon be torn down as a part of the cancellation of the White Pines Windmill Project. CITYNEWS/Cristina Howorun.

Ackerman is still being compensated for the lease of her land, as are the other land owners. “Twenty-thousand dollars a year, approximately, for 20 years. Do the math and we’re getting paid well,” she said. The total would be approximately $400,000.

Ackerman adds: “The amount hasn’t changed with the turbines being cancelled.”

She’s now getting paid in two lump sums — one when the turbines come down, and another when the decommissioning is fully complete. Removing the concrete, with winter on the horizon, could take upwards of a year.

According to terms reached with the government, the company has three years to fully restore the site. It is anticipated the wind turbines and towers will sit on the ground until next spring.

Humans have been around for more than 2 million years. But in the last 44 years, we have achieved what we haven’t in all this while: a mass annihilation of our fellow earthlings. Between 1970 and 2014, Earth lost nearly 60% decline of its mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, almost all of it due to human activity. The rate at which Earth is losing its biodiversity is comparable only to the mass extinctions. This and other findings have been published by the World Wildlife Fund in its Living Planet Report 2018, a stinging reminder of the declining health of the planet.

Published by WWF every two years, the report documents the state of the planet in terms of biodiversity, ecosystems, the demand on natural resources and its impact on nature and wildlife. This year, its results are even more devastating than ever:

20% of the Amazon has disappeared in just 50 years

in just 50 years On a global scale, the area of minimally disturbed forests declined by 92 million hectares between 2000 and 2013

between 2000 and 2013 Of all species that have gone extinct since 1500 AD, 75% were harmed by overexploitation or agriculture

The report states that as our reliance on natural reserves continues to grow, it’s clear that nature is not just a ‘nice thing to have’. It’s imperative for our survival.

A global deal for nature and people

WWF along with conservation and science colleagues around the world are calling for a new global deal between nature and people, involving decision makers at every level to make the right political, financial and consumer choices. WWF is collaborating with a consortium of almost 40 universities and organisations to launch a research initiative that will explore the critical work of putting together the best ways to save the planet.

The report says that the biggest challenge—and biggest opportunity—lies in changing our approach to development and remember that protecting nature also helps protect people.

In the words of Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF International, “Today, we still have a choice. We can be the founders of a global movement that changed our relationship with the planet. Or we can be the generation that had its chance and failed to act. The choice is ours.”

Google Is Funding Groups That Deny Climate Change,https://earther.gizmodo.com/google-is-funding-climate-change-denialism-1838973522,"Image : Carsten Koall ( Getty )

Despite all it s evidently performative public-facing climate change initiatives, Google is forking over “substantial” contributions to denier organizations and events.

A report from the Guardian published Friday revealed that the tech company is contributing to more than a dozen organizations that have questioned the need for action or pushed back against climate regulations and legislation.

As the Guardian noted, one of the groups listed as receiving significant contributions from Google is the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an organization that describes itself as baselessly questioning “global warming alarmism” and opposing “energy-rationing policies, including the Paris Climate Treaty, Kyoto Protocol, cap-and-trade legislation, and EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.” It was also influential in the Trump administration’s transition, including having one of its fellows lead drawing up plans to gut the Environmental Protection Agency.

Reached for comment by email, Google defended its sponsorship of such groups to Earther by stating that it funds entities with varying political agendas based on their tech policies.



“We sponsor organizations from across the political spectrum that advocate for strong technology policies,” the Google spokesperson told Earther. “We’ve been extremely clear that Google’s sponsorship doesn’t mean that we endorse that organization’s entire agenda—we may disagree strongly on some issues. Our position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100% renewable energy for our global operations.”

Earther asked Google which part of each climate-denying organization’s agenda it does support, but we did not receive an immediate reply.

In a strange defense for Google’s contributions to organizations that seemingly undermine its own public-facing policies—including its commitment to renewable energy and its sponsorship of climate action-focused events—the spokesperson added that Google is “hardly alone among companies that contribute to organizations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy.” While we can’t vouch for every claim that Google makes in its statement, it is a fact that other companies do indeed regularly contribute to organizations that hope to advance humanity’s extinction.

As limp a defense for Google’s agenda as that rationale is, it is also sadly true. The Guardian noted in its report that Google is listed as a sponsor for the State Policy Network’s (SPN) Annual Meeting, an event for which social media giant Facebook is also listed as a sponsor, as is Altria, which owns a minority stake in e-cigarette company and market titan Juul.

As the Guardian noted, SPN supports right-wing think tanks like the Heartland Institute, one of the most infamous sources of climate denial. The group includes the bald-faced lie on its climate change webpage that “[m]ost scientists do not believe human greenhouse gas emissions are a proven threat to the environment or to human well-being.” In addition, Heartland Institute has trashed teen activist Greta Thunberg following her speech before the United Nations last month, and it hosts a number of climate denial confabs, including one last year in New Orleans that drew members of Congress and White House staffers as speakers.

Google said it’s transparent about its sponsorships and pointed to its contributions to progressive organizations like the Center for American Progress. (Reminder: The Center for American Progress is a disgrace.) It also claimed that sponsorship of the SPN event was an initiative led by its civics team to help people from varying political affiliations use its tools and products.

Still, the SPN event would not be the first it’s sponsored with denier ties. Google was also a platinum sponsor—meaning it donated $25,000—at LibertyCon, which featured an event that undermined climate science. (Microsoft and Facebook were also sponsors of the event.) And wouldn’t you believe it, the Heartland Institute was a gold sponsor of the very same conference.

However Google attempts to fit the square peg of its political agenda into the round hole of reality, the bottom line is that all of that public-facing rhetoric about climate action is essentially meaningless if one of the most powerful companies in the world is actively contributing to the misinformation that continues to undermine the future and health of our planet.

So much for that whole “don’t be evil” thing."
"NY Gov Cuomo says coronavirus is ‘more dangerous’ than expected as New York cases jump 14% overnight to 75,795",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/gov-cuomo-says-coronavirus-is-more-dangerous-than-expected-as-new-york-cases-jump-14percent-overnight-to-75795.html,"Governor Andrew Cuomo Speaks at a press conference in New York, United States, on March 30, 2020. US Army Corps of Engineers completes a temporary field hospital at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as the coronavirus continues to spread on March 30, 2020 in New York City.

""We're all anxious, we're all tired, we're all fatigued. It's been all bad news for a long time. Our whole lifestyle has been disrupted. Everybody wants to know one thing, when will it end. Nobody knows,"" Cuomo said. ""We're dealing with a war we've never dealt with before. We need a totally different mindset and organizational transformation.""

Cuomo said 10,929 people have been hospitalized with the coronavirus, including 2,710 ICU patients. Almost 400 of those people were hospitalized overnight, he said.

The state's new cases make New York the coronavirus epicenter of the world, surpassing China's Hubei province which reported 67,801 confirmed cases since the virus emerged there in December.

""I'm tired of being behind this virus. We've been behind this virus from day one,"" the governor said in Albany. ""We underestimated this virus. It's more powerful, it's more dangerous than we expected.""

At a news conference, the governor also said his brother, Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchorman, has COVID-19 and is isolating himself.

Coronavirus cases in New York state jumped 14% overnight to 75,795 with 1,550 deaths across the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.

He said the outbreak in New York state may not peak for three weeks.

""If our apex is 14 to 21 days ... then [you] have to come down the other side of the mountain once you hit the apex,"" he said. ""So calibrate yourself and your expectations so you're not disappointed every morning you get up.""

He urged people to remain vigilant, even if it means remaining isolated for long periods of time.

""'Well, I'm bored.' I know! I'm bored!"" Cuomo said.

Cuomo also said he wants to move health workers from unfilled hospitals in the state into beleaguered hospitals in New York City.

On Monday, Cuomo issued a call on health-care workers across the United States to travel to New York to help the state battle the worst coronavirus outbreak in the nation. He said the outbreak in New York isn't an anomaly and will hit every part of the United States. He said he would encourage out-of-area health providers in the city to go elsewhere once they get experience in the epicenter of the nation's outbreak.

Also Monday, the hospital ship USNS Comfort arrived in New York to help relieve the city's hospitals. Cuomo said the ship will provide 1,000 hospital beds, and 1,200 personnel to New York for treating patients who don't have COVID-19.

Cuomo reiterated Tuesday that COVID-19 patients need ventilators a lot longer than most other respiratory patients, arguing the state needs a lot more. ""The longer people are in, they either get treated and leave or they get put on a ventilator,"" he said. ""The longer you're on the ventilator, the less likelihood you'll come off the ventilator.""

He said the state placed an order for 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each, but it expects to get just 2,500 California, Illinois, the federal government and Italy also ordered the same ventilators.

""It's like being on eBay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator. ... How inefficient. And then FEMA gets involved and FEMA starts bidding. And now FEMA is bidding on top of the 50. So FEMA is driving up the price. What sense does this make?"" Cuomo asked.

On Twitter, the governor's 49-year-old brother said he is feeling well, and will continue to anchor his program ""Cuomo Prime Time"" from his basement.

Chris Cuomo tweet

At Tuesday's news conference, the governor said: ""You don't really know Chris. You see Chris, he has his show at 9 o'clock on CNN but you just see one dimension. You see a person in his job and in his job he's combative and he's argumentative and he's pushing people, but that's his job. It's really not who he is. He's a really sweet, beautiful guy. He's my best friend."""
"The world may run out of top soil in 60 years, and it's needed to grow 95% of the worlds food",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/30/topsoil-farming-agriculture-food-toxic-america,"Without efforts to rebuild soil health, we could lose our ability to grow enough nutritious food to feed the planet’s population

The world grows 95% of its food in the uppermost layer of soil, making topsoil one of the most important components of our food system. But thanks to conventional farming practices, nearly half of the most productive soil has disappeared in the world in the last 150 years, threatening crop yields and contributing to nutrient pollution, dead zones and erosion. In the US alone, soil on cropland is eroding 10 times faster than it can be replenished.

If we continue to degrade the soil at the rate we are now, the world could run out of topsoil in about 60 years, according to Maria-Helena Semedo of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. Without topsoil, the earth’s ability to filter water, absorb carbon, and feed people plunges. Not only that, but the food we do grow will probably be lower in vital nutrients.

The modern combination of intensive tilling, lack of cover crops, synthetic fertilizers and pesticide use has left farmland stripped of the nutrients, minerals and microbes that support healthy plant life. But some farmers are attempting to buck the trend and save their lands along with their livelihoods.

“We never want to see our soil unless we go looking for it,” says Keith Berns, a Nebraska farmer whose land hasn’t seen a plow in three decades.

He and his brother, Brian, began the practice of no-till on their 2,100-acre corn and soybean farm when they learned it could increase the carbon, nutrients and water available in the soil. Their farm is in a particularly dry area of the country, and keeping moisture on their land is a top priority. For every 1% increase of carbon, an acre of land can hold an additional 40,000 gallons of water.

Once they stopped tilling, the Berns family saw organic matter in the soil increase, which can have the added benefit of making foods grown in the soil more nutritious.

Organic matter, a section of soil that contains decomposing plant or animal tissue, serves as a reservoir of nutrients that microbes can feast upon while they provide nitrogen to growing plants and sequester carbon. The more organic matter, the more organisms the soil can support.

Q&A Why the Guardian is launching a major reader-funded project on the toxicity of modern life Show Hide Pesticides in your breakfast cereal. Carcinogenic chemicals in your furniture, and contaminated drinking water. Welcome to Toxic America – a Guardian project which will explore the health implications of living in an environment that can expose all of us to chemical contamination on a daily basis through the air we breathe, the food we eat, the products we use and the water we drink. The American public is routinely exposed to toxic chemicals that have long been banned in countries such as the UK, Germany and France.

Of the more than 40,000 chemicals used in consumer products in the US, according to the EPA, less than 1% have been rigorously tested for human safety. Under the Trump administration there are signs it’s only getting worse.

The Guardian is asking our readers to help us raise $150,000 to increase our coverage of the toxic chemicals in our environment for the rest of 2019.

This series will investigate the ways in which chemicals in our water, food and environment can impair growth, development and health, causing a toxic fallout that can include: cognitive and behavioural difficulties, obesity, diabetes, infertility and birth defects.

We will also examine the power of the $640bn chemical industry – which has a lobby that’s currently better funded than the NRA.

If we hit our fundraising goal by 30 June, the six-month project will include dozens of articles, videos, opinion pieces and visual stories over the course of 2019. We hope you’ll consider making a contribution.

“If you had a handful of soil, you’d have more organisms than people on earth,” says Rob Myers, a soil scientist at the University of Missouri. With increased organic matter, the Bernses grew more food using less water and fertilizer.

In the 1990s, they began planting cover crops between harvests. The rye and buckwheat, among other cover crops, provided more organic matter to the soil, further feeding microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. The crops also kept nitrogen in the soil and reduced erosion.

Amid growing concerns about topsoil loss, no-till and cover crops are becoming more popular, according to the 2017 US Census of Agriculture. Forty per cent of US cropland is grown on no-till farms, up from 32% in 2012.

Though still not widely adopted, cover crops are becoming more popular with farmers, too, particularly in the country’s corn belt. Nationwide, farmers planted cover crops on 15m acres, a 50% increase from five years earlier.

The Berns brothers saw this change first-hand. When they first decided to plant cover crops, they had trouble finding seeds. Seeing a hole in the market, they began their own cover crop seed company in 2009, putting together what farmers now call a cover crop cocktail to sow in the fall. In their first year, they sold enough seed to cover 2,000 acres. Last year, they sold enough to cover 850,000.

The sense of urgency over topsoil is growing as the planet is projected to reach 9 billion people by 2050. Without a healthy farm system, farmers won’t be able to feed the world’s growing population, says Dave Montgomery, a geologist at the University of Washington and author of the book Growing a Revolution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life.

To see what can happen to civilizations that lost the topsoil they needed to grow food, look no further than Syria or Libya. Roman tax records show that those areas grew ample amounts of wheat, but as farmers continued to plow their fields, they exposed valuable microbes and topsoil eroded. Today those areas barely have any soil to grow crops.

“Societies that lose their topsoil, their descendants pay the price,” Montgomery says. “Nature takes a long time to build soil.” By some estimates, it can take 500 years for healthy topsoil to develop and less than a century to degrade.

The world is also facing a crisis in nutrition. A 2004 study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition compared nutrients in crops grown in 1950 to those grown in 1999 and found declines in protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamin B2 and vitamin C.

The practice of farming one or two crops, like corn and soybeans, hastened soil degradation, according to Montgomery. Government policy encouraged US farmers to specialize, resulting in monocultures that require an increasing amount of water and fertilizer and pesticides.

Practices, however, are changing, say Montgomery and Myers. “I think you are seeing a big movement, but it’s just getting rolling,” Montgomery says.

Improving soil health pays dividends, but investment in topsoil may take years to show results. This is a challenge for farmers operating on tight margins, according to Montgomery, who says that the government could do more to help incentivize best practices.

Berns suggests that farmers make these changes slowly, employing them on one patch of the farm at a time. In mid-Atlantic states like Maryland and Virginia, local governments have incentivized farmers with grants to plant cover crops, resulting in high adoption rates over the last 20 years.

The stakes are high. If farmers in the US and around the world don’t continue to put a higher value on what nurtures their crops, we could be facing an unimaginable catastrophe, according to Myers: “We have to have that topsoil; it’s paramount to our survival.”"
"‘High likelihood of human civilisation coming to end’ by 2050, report finds",https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-global-warming-end-human-civilisation-research-a8943531.html,"Human civilisation as we know it may have already entered its last decades, a worrying new report examining the likely future of our planet’s habitability warns.

The increasingly disastrous impacts of the climate crisis, coupled with inaction to tackle it are sending our planet down a bleak path towards an increasingly chaotic world which could overwhelm societies around the globe, the report’s authors contend.

The paper, produced by the Melbourne-based think tank the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration, is presented by the former chief of the Australian Defence Forces and retired Royal Australian Navy Admiral Chris Barrie.

In his introduction he says the report’s authors “have laid bare the unvarnished truth about the desperate situation humans, and our planet, are in, painting a disturbing picture of the real possibility that human life on earth may be on the way to extinction, in the most horrible way.”

The paper argues that “climate change now represents a near to mid-term existential threat to human civilisation,” and calls for a recalibration in how governments respond to estimated climate scenarios so they take worst case projections more seriously.

It also argues that the detrimental impacts of climate breakdown, such as increasing scarcity of food and water, will act as a catalyst on extant socio-political instabilities to accelerate disorder and conflict over the next three decades.

To usefully prepare for such an impact, the report calls for an overhaul in countries’ risk management “which is fundamentally different from conventional practice”.

“It would focus on the high-end, unprecedented possibilities, instead of assessing middle-of-the-road probabilities on the basis of historic experience.”

The research was authored by David Spratt, Breakthrough’s research director, and Ian Dunlop, a former international oil, gas and coal industry executive, who worked for Royal Dutch Shell and was chair of the Australian Coal Association.

Their paper offers what they say is a plausible scenario providing “a glimpse into a world of outright chaos”.

Based on lack of meaningful global action to rapidly extinguish all greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade, the authors sketch out a scenario in which global emissions peak in 2030.

In this case, using several existing studies, they hypothesise average global temperatures may reach 3C above pre-industrial levels by 2050.

The effect of this would be to realise the “hothouse Earth” scenario in which the planet would be heading for at least another degree of warming.

The reflective sea ice would melt, warming oceans further and raising sea levels rapidly. There would be “widespread permafrost loss and large-scale Amazon drought and dieback”.

The scenario reads: “The destabilisation of the Jet Stream has very significantly affected the intensity and geographical distribution of the Asian and West African monsoons and, together with the further slowing of the Gulf Stream, is impinging on life support systems in Europe.

“North America suffers from devastating weather extremes including wildfires, heatwaves, drought and inundation. The summer monsoons in China have failed, and water flows into the great rivers of Asia are severely reduced by the loss of more than one-third of the Himalayan ice sheet.

“Glacial loss reaches 70 per cent in the Andes, and rainfall in Mexico and central America falls by half.”

This scenario would also put the world on track for 5C of warming by 2100.

The paper notes that scientists have already warned that warming of 4C is incompatible with an organised global community, would be devastating to the majority of ecosystems, and has a high probability of not being stable. The World Bank said the planet may be “beyond adaptation” to such conditions.

“Even for 2C of warming, more than a billion people may need to be relocated and in high-end scenarios, the scale of destruction is beyond our capacity to model, with a high likelihood of human civilisation coming to an end,” the paper says.

The authors say “the world is currently completely unprepared to envisage, and even less deal with, the consequences of catastrophic climate change,” but also put forward policy recommendations which could help to mitigate the worst effects.

“To reduce this risk and protect human civilisation, a massive global mobilisation of resources is needed in the coming decade to build a zero-emissions industrial system and set in train the restoration of a safe climate.

“This would be akin in scale to the World War II emergency mobilisation.”"
“Humans might be the first species to knowingly choose self-extinction.”,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/03/07/re-inhabiting-planet-earth,"“I believe that for a moment I thought the explosion might set fire to the atmosphere and thus finish the Earth, even though I knew that this was not possible.”

These words of Manhattan Project physicist Emilio Segre, quoted by Richard Rhodes in his book The Making of the Atomic Bomb, refer to the Trinity blast on July 16, 1945, at Alamogordo, N.M., the first atomic explosion in history and, so it appears, a turning point for all life on this planet.

The atmosphere didn’t catch fire at 5:30 that morning, but Segre’s words remain relevant, sort of like radioactive fallout. They encapsulate what may be history’s ultimate moment of human arrogance: the belief in a sense of separateness from and superiority to nature so thorough that we have, with our monstrous intelligence, the ability and therefore the right to play Bad God and make the whole planet go poof.

Turns out the Trinity test set into motion something even more profound than the nuclear era. The bomb didn’t just “defeat” Japan and define the Cold War, with its suicidal nuclear arms race. It is also, at least symbolically, marks the beginning of what has come to be known as the Anthropocene: an era of profound climate and “Earth system” destabilization caused by human activity and therefore, like it or not, establishing humans as co-equal participants in activity of the natural world.

Any institution founded on such myths and illusions – that the planet is ours to exploit, that some people matter more than others, that national borders are real, that dehumanizing and killing one another (a little activity called war) keeps us safe, that money equals God – cannot and will not survive the Anthropocene.

There’s more to this “co-equal” status than nuclear weapons, of course. They may be the tip of our arrogance, but we’ve been exploiting and rearranging the planet for nearly 12,000 years, since the beginning of the era we are now leaving, the Holocene, an era of climate stability in which human civilization and all written history emerged. From the development of agriculture to the industrial revolution – the plundering of the Earth for oil and coal, the spewing of infinitesimal plastic nurdles across the planet, the creation of continent-sized trash mounds afloat in the oceans, the replacement of biodiversity with monoculture, the poisoning of the air and water and, yes, nuclear testing and the spread of radioactive fallout – humanity, or at least a small portion of it, has exercised an intelligence with a serious moral void.

And now the chickens are coming home to roost. Or as David Korten put it: “Humans might be the first species to knowingly choose self-extinction.”

What’s crucial about all this goes well beyond the dangers of climate change and the need for techno-fixes to our socioeconomic structures. History professor Julia Adeney Thomas puts it this way: “The Anthropocene’s interrelated systematicity presents not a problem, but a multidimensional predicament. A problem might be solved, often with a single technological tool produced by experts in a single field, but a predicament presents a challenging condition requiring resources and ideas of many kinds. We don’t solve predicaments; instead, we navigate through them.”

She adds: “. . . the hardest challenges will be about how to alter our political and economic systems.”

These aren’t just technical problems for “experts” to solve while the rest of look on (or go shopping). What’s emerging from all this for me is that humanity has to evolve for its own survival, and evolution is going to take all of us – or at least all of us who can think beyond the structures of thought in which we grew up, in which we came of age.

Simple as this sounds, the implications of such a statement, if it is true, begin mushrooming into unfathomable complexity, especially when “all” refers not simply to all 7.4 billion human beings out there but all of life: the biosphere, the planet. We have to rethink who we are in a way that has, quite likely, never before happened.

“In the Anthropocene the old simplicities are gone,” writes Mark Garavan. “We are no longer human subjects acting upon an objective nature ‘outside’ us. Nature and human are now bound together. Free nature is over. Free humanity is over. They are relics of the Holocene. In our new age, Earth and Human are entangled irrevocably together. Welcome to the era of Earth-bound responsibility! The assumptions, the myths, the illusions of the Holocene no longer apply.”

And any institution founded on such myths and illusions – that the planet is ours to exploit, that some people matter more than others, that national borders are real, that dehumanizing and killing one another (a little activity called war) keeps us safe, that money equals God – cannot and will not survive the Anthropocene, and the “solutions” that emerge from such institutions, e.g., solving the climate crisis, are rooted in failure. “The challenge,” says Garavan, “is to re-think and re-inhabit our planet.”

That is to say, we have to start over.

And I think that’s what’s happening. New values are percolating. So are old values – the values human beings once embraced as they claimed the right to occupy Planet Earth. These values include interdependence and cooperation, and profound reverence for the planet. Rupert Ross, in his book Returning to the Teachings, points out, for instance: “The Lakotah had no language for insulting other orders of existence: “pest . . . waste . . . weed.”

Indigenous understanding is not “primitive.” It includes cooperation and compassion in its grasp of how things work, of what it means to live within the circle of life. The indigenous peoples of the planet have remained its protectors.

As Jade Begay and Ayşe Gürsöz point out at EcoWatch: “Even the seemingly groundbreaking Paris agreement neither includes human rights in its text nor acknowledges Indigenous rights — even though lands and waters stewarded by Indigenous communities make up 80 percent of the world’s biodiversity. What we need is for climate policy and the overall climate movement to address problems of inequality, because climate change is just as much a social issue as it is an environmental issue.”

In other words, biodiversity and social diversity are both precious. Knowing this means re-inhabiting the planet, not setting it on fire."

"The Weishan Volcano in China is entering an active phase after not erupting for 50,000 years",https://watchers.news/2020/06/17/magma-recharging-beneath-the-weishan-volcano-of-the-intraplate-wudalianchi-volcanic-field-china/,"A team of geophysicists warned that Wei Mountain in northeast China could be ""recharging"" for an eruption after two huge magma chambers were discovered under the volcano, which last erupted more than half a million years ago.

The researchers said they discovered two vast magma chambers under Wei in the Wudalianchi volcanic field in Heilongjiang, near the border with North Korea and Russia. The models indicate the chambers dwarf the volcano, which is about 100 m (330 feet) tall and 5 km (3 miles) wide.

The volcano's last eruption was more than 500 000 years ago and was already considered extinct, making the discovery a surprise to the geophysicists.

The researchers have been more focused on Changbai or Paektu Mountain, whose explosion in 946 A.D., was one of the strongest volcanic events in history. But the volcanic fields of Wei and Changbai ""would be linked to some degree,"" the study noted.

For the study, geophysicist Zhang Haijang and a team from the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, Anhui, studied almost 100 sites across Wei Mountain.

They used sensors to spot electromagnetic abnormalities underground and found magma, an unusual blip from 15 km (9 miles) underground), and another one at 8 km (5 miles).

The computer modeling suggested there could be two huge magma chambers with a combined depth of more than 9 km (6 miles). The chambers were part of a larger system that could be ""linked with the Changbai volcano by secondary mantle convection.""

Based on the calculations, 15 percent of the upper chamber was now filled with molten rock. Some studies said a volcanic eruption may occur when a chamber fills to 40 percent magma.

Zhang and the team remarked that seismic activity had increased at Changbai from 2002 to 2005, indicating ""magmatic activity beneath the volcano was increased."" Its last eruption was in 1903.

""Volcanic activity in northeast China is likely to be in an active stage, and active volcanic monitoring is needed to further understand the magmatic systems in this region,"" they concluded.

According to Xu Jiandong, director of the volcanic research division at the China Earthquake Administration in Beijing who was not involved in the study, the last eruption at the Wudalianchi field was in the early 18th century, which formed two volcanic mountains, Laohei and Huoshao.

""We have not detected any sign of active magma chambers under Laohei and Huoshao, which is very strange considering the recent eruption event,"" said Xu. Seismic stations had been monitoring the volcanoes for decades.

Now, the results of the Wei study added to the mystery. ""If there really are huge magma chambers in the area, we should have detected some related seismic activities-- when the lower chamber recharges the upper one, there should be some movement,"" he added.

""But so far, after decades of monitoring on the site, we’ve picked up almost nothing. The whole area has been very, very quiet.""

Xu also said that it was too early to say that the chambers even existed. While the abnormal signals detected by Zhang's team appeared to be magma chambers, they could have been caused by other substances with high conductivity, like water or rocks.

""What we know for certain is that the Wudalianchi region is active – it’s like congee boiling in a pot,"" said Xu.

Abstract

The last volcanic eruptions at the intraplate Wudalianchi volcanic field in northeast China were ~300 yr ago. Recent ambient noise tomography (ANT) imaged a potential magma chamber beneath one of its volcanoes, the Weishan volcano, which last erupted at ca. 50 ka. To image the spatial distribution of the magmatic system and estimate the melt fractions beneath the Weishan volcano, we use a dense magnetotelluric (MT) network (average site spacing of ~1 km) around the Weishan cone to image a three-dimensional (3-D) resistivity structure beneath the volcano. For the first time, 3-D MT inversion illuminates the high-resolution spatial distribution of a very low-resistivity body of ~0.3–3 Ω·m at depth of ~2–15 km beneath the Weishan volcano. From the 3-D resistivity model, it can be deduced there exists a magma chamber in the upper and middle crust. From both low-velocity anomalies from ANT and low-resistivity anomalies from MT imaging, melt fractions of magma reservoirs are reliably estimated to be >~15%. From the morphology of magma reservoirs and the shallow magma chamber, the Weishan volcano can be best described by the model of transcrustal magmatic system. Considering the significant melt fractions and active earthquakes and tremors occurring around magma reservoirs, the Weishan volcano is likely in an active stage with magma recharging. Therefore, it needs more active monitoring for better forecasting of its potential future eruptions.

The Climate Change Paper So Depressing It's Sending People to Therapy,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbwpdb/the-climate-change-paper-so-depressing-its-sending-people-to-therapy,"What if I told you there was a paper on climate change that was so uniquely catastrophic, so perspective-altering, and so absolutely depressing that it's sent people to support groups and encouraged them to quit their jobs and move to the countryside?

Good news: there is. It's called ""Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy."" I was introduced to it via an unlikely source—a guy formerly in advertising who had left his job to become a full-time environmental campaigner. ""We're fucked,"" he told me. ""Climate change is going to fuck us over. I remember thinking, Should I just accept the deep adaptation paper and move to the Scottish countryside and wait out the apocalypse?""

""Deep Adaptation"" is quite unlike any other academic paper. There's the language (""we are about to play Russian Roulette with the entire human race with already two bullets loaded""). There's the flashes of dark humor (""I was only partly joking earlier when I questioned why I was even writing this paper""). But most of all, there's the stark conclusions that it draws about the future. Chiefly, that it's too late to stop climate change from devastating our world—and that ""climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near term.""

How near? About a decade.

Professor Jem Bendell, a sustainability academic at the University of Cumbria, wrote the paper after taking a sabbatical at the end of 2017 to review and understand the latest climate science ""properly—not sitting on the fence anymore,"" as he puts it on the phone to me.

What he found terrified him. ""The evidence before us suggests that we are set for disruptive and uncontrollable levels of climate change, bringing starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and war,"" he writes in the paper. ""Our norms of behavior—that we call our 'civilization'—may also degrade.""

""It is time,"" he adds, ""we consider the implications of it being too late to avert a global environmental catastrophe in the lifetimes of people alive today.""

Even a schmuck like me is familiar with some of the evidence Bendell sets out to prove his point. You only needed to step outside during the record-breaking heatwave last year to acknowledge that 17 of the 18 hottest years on the planet have occurred since 2000. Scientists already believe we are soon on course for an ice-free Arctic, which will only accelerate global warming. Back in 2017, even Fox News reported scientists' warnings that the Earth's sixth mass extinction was underway.

Erik Buitenhuis, a senior researcher at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, tells me that Bendell's conclusions may sound extreme, but he agrees with the report's overall assessment. ""I think societal collapse is indeed inevitable,"" he says, though adds that ""the process is likely to take decades to centuries.""

The important thing, Buitenhuis says, is to realize that the negative effects of climate change have already been with us for some time: ""Further gradual deterioration looks much more likely to me than a disaster within the next ten years that will be big enough that, after that, everybody will agree the status quo is doomed.""

""Jem's paper is in the main well-researched and supported by relatively mainstream climate science,"" says Professor Rupert Read, chair of the Green House think-tank and a philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia. ""That's why I'm with him on the fundamentals. And more and more people are.""

Read's key disagreement with Bendell is his belief that we still have time to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, saying, ""I think it's hubris to think that we know the future."" But that doesn't mean Bendell's premise is wrong: ""The way I see it, deep adaptation is insurance against the possibility—or rather, the probability—of some kind of collapse,"" says Read. ""'Deep Adaptation' is saying, 'What do we need to do if collapse is something we need to realistically plan for?'""

When I speak to Bendell, he tells me he thinks of ""Deep Adaptation"" as more of an ethical and philosophical framework, rather than a prophecy about the future of the planet. ""The longer we refuse to talk about climate change as already here and screwing with our way of life—because we don't want to think like that because it's too frightening or will somehow demotivate people—the less time we have to reduce harm,"" he says with deliberation.

What does he mean by harm? ""Starvation is the first one,"" he answers, pointing to lowering harvests of grain in Europe in 2018 due to drought that saw the EU reap 6 million tons less wheat. ""In the scientific community at the moment, the appropriate thing is to say that 2018 was an anomaly. However, if you look at what's been happening over the last few years, it isn't an anomaly. There's a possibility that 2018 is the new best case scenario.""

That means, in Bendell's view, that governments need to start planning emergency responses to climate change, including growing and stockpiling food.

He minces his words even less in his paper: ""When I say starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and war, I mean in your own life. With the power down, soon you won't have water coming out of your tap. You will depend on your neighbors for food and some warmth. You will become malnourished. You won't know whether to stay or go. You will fear being violently killed before starving to death.""

Should people start building bunkers and buying bulletproof vests? ""There's no way of getting through this unless we try together,"" he says. ""We need to help people stay fed and watered where they live already to reduce disruption and reduce civil unrest as much as we can."" Of the Silicon Valley financiers prepping for the apocalypse in New Zealand, he says: ""Once money doesn't matter anymore and the armed guards are trying to feed their starving children, what do you think they'll do? The billionaires doing that are just deluded.""

Bendell wasn't always this gloomy about the state of the world. He once worked for WWF, one of the biggest environmental charities in the world, and in 2012 founded the Institute for Leadership and Sustainability (IFLAS) at the University of Cumbria. The World Economic Forum named him a Young Global Leader for his work. So how did he end up writing a paper that determined that civilization—and environmental sustainability as we currently understand it—is doomed?

""Since the age of 15, I've been an environmentalist,"" he tells me. ""I've given my life professionally and personally. I'm a workaholic, and it was all about sustainability."" Once he sat down with the data, however, he realized that his field was quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of oncoming climate catastrophe. ""It would mean not getting super excited about the expansion of your recycling program in a major multinational,"" he says. ""It's a completely different paradigm of what we should be looking at.""

What he didn’t expect was for the paper to take off online. ""It was aimed at those people in my professional community and why we're in denial,"" he says. ""When I put it out there, I didn’t expect 15-year-olds in schools in Indonesia to be reading it with their teachers."" He says that ""Deep Adaptation"" has been downloaded over 110,000 times since it was released by IFLAS as an occasional paper. ""Someone in the alternative economics and bitcoin crowd told me, 'Oh, everyone's talking about deep adaptation in London at all the dinner parties,'"" he laughs.

Researchers from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), an established progressive think-tank, consulted Bendell's paper in the process of writing its new report, ""This is a crisis: Facing up to the age of environmental breakdown."" Laurie Laybourn-Langton, its lead author, told me via email: ""I appreciated the frankness of the report in facing up to issues that so many in research and policy communities seem unwilling to. We don't subscribe to the view that social collapse is inevitable, however.""

He explains: ""This is partly because it's so hard to predict the outcomes of the complex and uncertain process of environmental shocks interacting with social and economic systems. We simply don't know. That said, they shouldn’t be disregarded as a potential outcome, and so we are calling for greater levels of preparedness to these shocks.""

Not everyone was so taken with the paper. Bendell submitted it to a well-respected academic journal for publication, with little success. Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal (SAMPJ) told me that the paper was in need of ""major revisions"" before it would be ready for publication. Bendell ended up publishing it through IFLAS and his blog. ""The academic process is such that I took that as an effective rejection,"" he explains, saying that the reviewers wanted him to fundamentally alter his conclusions. ""I couldn't completely rewrite the paper to say that I don't think collapse is inevitable. It was asking for a different paper.""

Emerald, the scholarly publisher that owns SAMPJ, says it takes issue with how Bendell frames its reception of its paper on his blog: ""the study on collapse they thought you should not read—yet."" A spokesperson told me: ""The decision was arrived at based on the merit of the submitted article and the double blind peer review process integral to academia and the advancement of knowledge. SAMPJ, and [editor Carol Adams] are proud members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and adhere to the highest ethical standards in publishing. We see no evidence that the decision of Major Revision was politically motivated.

""Emerald requested the author correct their blog post to reflect the facts. This request was unfortunately ignored. The post continues to imply the paper was rejected because it was deemed too controversial. The paper was not rejected, and was given a Major Revision due to the rigorous standards of the scholarly output of the journal.""

Bendell says he did reply to Emerald's request to amend his blog post—but only if they would consider telling him the decisions of those who reviewed his paper. (Under the double blind peer review, reviewers' decisions are anonymous.) ""That title can be read in a number of ways,"" he says. ""It is a paper that the reviewers didn't want you to read. They didn't want it published.""

Climate gloom and doom is nothing new—doomsday preppers have been stockpiling their freeze-dried food rations for decades now. But Bendell's paper appears to have hit a unique nerve, especially given that the average scientific paper is estimated to be read by only three or so people. Rupert Read tells me that he was sent it simultaneously by three other academics when it was published. But it hasn’t trended on Twitter. It hasn't been pushed by a celebrity. It was briefly mentioned in a Bloomberg Businessweek article, but that's it.

""Deep Adaptation"" is that unique social phenomenon: an academic paper that has gone viral through word of mouth.

Nathan Savelli, a 31-year-old high school life coach from Hamilton, Canada, was recommended the paper by a local environmental activist. Reading it sent him spiraling into depression. ""I guess in some ways it felt like I was diagnosed with a terminal illness,"" he tells me. ""If I'm being honest, it was a mix of heartbreaking sadness and extreme anger.""

Savelli felt so low that he sought help from a climate grief support group organized by 350.org, the global grassroots climate movement. ""I had attended counseling in the past for other issues, but never a group session, and thought it might be something helpful for me,"" he tells me. Did it help? ""I'm not sure I'd say it alleviated my grief, but it was definitely comforting to be around people who understood what I was feeling.""

And therein lies the problem with ""Deep Adaptation:"" if you accept that the paper is entirely correct in its prediction of collapse, how do you move on with your life? How do you even get out of bed in the morning?

""I'm aware of what difficult emotions it triggers,"" Bendell acknowledges. ""I do believe that if you’ve come across this [paper], then absolutely some grief and despair is very natural. Why isn't that OK? We all die in the end. Life is about impermanence."" On his blog, he lists several sources for psychological support, including several groups on Facebook and LinkedIn that discuss collapse and offer help to those struggling to come to terms with the conclusions of his paper.

But, Bendell adds, reading the paper has been ""transformative"" for some. ""People find a new boldness about living life on their own terms—actually connecting to their heart's desire. How do they wish to live, and why don't they live that way now rather than postponing it?"" In one case, it even helped prompt one high-ranking academic to quit her job and the city.

In December of 2017, Dr. Alison Green left her post as the pro vice-chancellor of Arden University. She had read the IPCC report warning that the world is nowhere near averting global temperature increases, as well as the 1,656-page National Climate Assessment on how climate change is now dramatically affecting our lives—and then she read Bendell's paper.

All three combined to put her on the road to a drastic life change. ""My desire is to get out of academia and to get out of the city. I tell people I’m heading for the hills,"" she tells me over the phone. ""My plan is to get a smallholding and live more closely to nature.""

Reading the paper, she says, helped to crystallize her increasing uneasiness about the pace and scale of climate change. ""What was really striking about this paper is that a social scientist was saying—not just the wacky fringe, this is a professor at an established institution, with a track record—saying that he believed that collapse was inevitable.""

""That,"" she adds, ""had a profound effect on me.""

She's not the only one. Bendell himself says that he is still working out how much he can reconcile his job as an academic with his newfound conclusions about the state of the future.

""I think the reason why my framing and my paper took off is that it’s maybe the first time a social scientist was saying these things categorically,"" he says. ""We are seemingly in denial. It's time to break that taboo and have serious conversations about what we do now.""

Indonesia proposes to eliminate minimum wage.,https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/25/workers-once-again-protest-against-job-creation-bill.html,"Members of the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions (KSPI) have once again gathered in front of the House of Representatives (DPR) compound in Senayan, Central Jakarta, to protest against the omnibus bill on job creation as well as recent mass layoffs amid the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

KSPI president Said Iqbal said the group appreciated the House’s decision to form a team that facilitates communication with workers regarding the contentious articles in the labor cluster of the bill.

“The rally today doesn’t only aim to protest but also to convey support for lawmakers to ensure that workers’ aspirations are heard,” he said in a statement on Tuesday, as quoted by kompas.com.

The KSPI had staged similar protests on July 29 and Aug. 3.

Said went on to say that at least nine concerns lay behind labor unions’ persistent opposition to the draft legislation, chief among them being the elimination of the minimum wage, the reduction of severance packages and exploitative working hours.

Furthermore, he claimed that the bill also entailed the elimination of various benefits, such as employee leave rights.

“In addition, a pay raise would be based on economic growth, which contradicts [Government Regulation] No. 78/2005 stipulating that the minimum wage may be raised according to inflation and economic growth,” Said added.

Said suggested that the government and lawmakers expunge the labor cluster from the bill altogether, especially if the two parties wanted to speed up the deliberation.

The Jakarta Police have deployed 5,800 personnel to the House complex and diverted traffic from the vicinity to ensure public order and safety, as reported by tribunnews.com.

Various other labor unions have staged similar protests in several other regions, including Bandung in West Java, Serang in Banten, Semarang in Central Java and Surabaya in East Java, according to Said. (rfa)"
Coral reefs in Persian Gulf dead due to climate change: official,https://en.mehrnews.com/news/150835/Coral-reefs-in-Persian-Gulf-dead-due-to-climate-change-official,"He added that in case the current conditions go on, a catastrophe is expected.

“Unfortunately, the color of above 80 percent of coral reefs has turned white and this will end into serious problems for the next generations,” Kalantari said.

He urged Iran Veterinary Organization to take the required measures to prevent the disaster.

Shallow-waters growing Persian Gulf corals need sunlight to survive; however, with global warming spiking in recent years, corals have entered a process of gradual death.

Research shows that Persian Gulf is home to different species of corals which have not survived the harmful effects of global warming, and a deadly white hue indicates the shadow of a gradual death looming around.

In mid-September, 2015, the time head of Qeshm Free Economic Zone tells Mehr News local correspondent that a growing temperature of Persian Gulf waters had contributed to bleach —a process in which corals expel their symbiotic algae living in their tissue, causing them to turn white and increasing their vulnerability to disease and death— of the corals; Mohammad Hashem Dakhteh adds further that rising water temperatures have a grave danger for bleaching; “research indicates declining resistance to rising temperatures in water especially in summers; according to global surveillance of earth temperatures, a spot in Persian Gulf has been detected as the hottest spot on earth, and if the trend continues, we will see the dying out of the corals anytime soon,” he adds, “in recent summers, bleaching has been only partial, and with summers passing, they usually recover their natural hues; however, with continuous bleaching along with increased vulnerability, now more resistant species also undergo bleaching, and there are concerns that the bleaching would be permanent, thus causing coral death.”

America finally hits the panic button. Harvard Scientists Funded by Bill Gates to Begin Spraying Particles Into the Sky In Experiment to Dim the Sun.,https://thefreethoughtproject.com/harvard-geoengineering-particles-stratosphere/,"Spread the love

No, we are not a satire site. We are not a conspiracy theory site. The information you are about to read is factually accurate and 100% real despite the ostensible ‘skeptics’ who claim otherwise. The controversial subject of geoengineering or weather modification – which was popularized, and oversimplified with the term “chemtrails” – is once again stepping from the shadows and into the light of public scrutiny. And it may soon be a reality as Harvard scientists plan first ever experiment to spray particles in the sky to dim the sun.

What was once a conspiracy theory is now the subject of congressional debate, peer-reviewed studies, and now a Harvard experiment. Harvard scientists will attempt to replicate the climate-cooling effect of volcanic eruptions with a world-first solar geoengineering experiment. The university announced this month that it has created an external advisory panel to examine the potential ethical, environmental and geopolitical impacts of this geoengineering project, which has been developed by the university’s researchers.

According to Nature Magazine, Louise Bedsworth, executive director of the California Strategic Growth Council, a state agency that promotes sustainability and economic prosperity, will lead the Harvard advisory panel, the university said on 29 July. The other seven members include Earth-science researchers and specialists in environmental and climate law and policy.

What was once a conspiracy theory will soon be a reality—any day now.

Known as the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), the experiment will spray calcium carbonate particles high above the earth to mimic the effects of volcanic ash blocking out the sun to produce a cooling effect.

The experiment was announced in Nature magazine last year, who was one of few outlets to look into this unprecedented step toward geoengineering the planet.

If all goes as planned, the Harvard team will be the first in the world to move solar geoengineering out of the lab and into the stratosphere, with a project called the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx). The first phase — a US$3-million test involving two flights of a steerable balloon 20 kilometres above the southwest United States — could launch as early as the first half of 2019. Once in place, the experiment would release small plumes of calcium carbonate, each of around 100 grams, roughly equivalent to the amount found in an average bottle of off-the-shelf antacid. The balloon would then turn around to observe how the particles disperse.

Naturally, the experiment is concerning to many people, including environmental groups, who, according to Nature, say such efforts are a dangerous distraction from addressing the only permanent solution to climate change: reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

The idea of injecting particles into the atmosphere to cool the earth also seems outright futile considering what scientists are trying to mimic—volcanic eruptions. If we look at the second largest eruption of the 20th century, Mount Pinatubo, which erupted in the Philippines in 1991, it injected 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide aerosols into the stratosphere. Scientists from the USGS estimated that this 20 million tons only lowered the temperature of the planet by about 1°F (0.5°C) and this only lasted a year because the particles eventually fell to back to Earth.

The Harvard team, led by scientists Frank Keutsch and David Keith, has been working on the SCoPEx project for several years but they haven’t always been in total agreement. In fact, as Nature reported, Keutsch—who is not a climate scientist—previously thought the idea to be “totally insane.” But he’s since changed his mind. As Nature reports:

When he saw Keith talk about the SCoPEx idea at a conference after starting at Harvard in 2015, he says his initial reaction was that the idea was “totally insane”. Then he decided it was time to engage. “I asked myself, an atmospheric chemist, what can I do?” He joined forces with Keith and Anderson, and has since taken the lead on the experimental work.

Adding to the questionable nature of this experiment is the fact that it is largely funded by none other than Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates. Gates is no stranger to funding controversial experiments as he’s publicly funded many of them including one that would implant devices into babies to automatically give them vaccines.

While the Harvard team’s experiment may sound like something out of a dystopian science fiction movie, the reality is that it has long been on the table of governments and think tanks from around the world. In fact, just last November, a study published in Environmental Research Letters, talked about doing the exact same thing—geoengineering and planes spraying particulates into the atmosphere to curb global warming.

What’s more, that study echoed the sentiments of then-CIA director John Brennan when he addressed the Council on Foreign Relations in 2016, detailing a similar process of spraying chemical particulates in the atmosphere to cool the planet.

At the meeting, Brennan addressed instability and transnational threats to global security at a meeting with the Council on Foreign Relations. During his long-winded talk of threats to US interests and how the largely CIA-created ISIL threat is impacting the world, Brennan brought up the topic of geoengineering.

Another example is the array of technologies—often referred to collectively as geoengineering—that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change. One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun’s heat, in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.

Brennan went on to echo the calls from some scientists who have called for aerial spraying.

An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels. The process is also relatively inexpensive—the National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly.

Again, this is not some conspiracy theory. Watch him say all of this in the video below starting at the 12:05 marker.

The extent to which Brennan talked about stratospheric aerosol injection shows that he and the CIA have likely been considering this for some time.

Although we are hearing more and more talk about geoengineering, it has been around for a very long time and not just in the realm of conspiracy theories. In fact, scientists have already suggested that it could be going on right now, unintentionally.

Researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are suggesting contrails from airplanes may be inadvertently geoengineering the skies.

Chuck Long is a researcher with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory at the University of Colorado in Boulder. At the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in 2015, Long and his team released their paper, “Evidence of Clear-Sky Daylight Whitening: Are we already conducting geoengineering?” The analysis found that vapor from airplanes may be altering the climate through accidental geoengineering.

To be clear, no one here is claiming to be an expert on climate change or the effects of geoengineering. But one thing is clear and it’s the fact that there is still much to be debated and learned before humans deliberately begin altering Earth’s climate. Aside from doing nothing to curb carbon emissions, if we are so quick to jump on this method, it could set off a chain reaction that could prove to be catastrophic.

Please share this article with your friends and family so that they may see what’s being planned for their future.

Exceptional Summer Temperatures over 40 Degrees Above Normal Recorded Today Across Europe in Mid-Winter,https://www.severe-weather.eu/recent-events/27c-nw-italy-extreme-warmth-mk/?fbclid=IwAR0Z_jltamvFyhibDZjBnzoHK_Aa5cdPaWw-kUNiAl71VkaTXQsuN3EdR4A,"The third (3rd) day of extreme warmth across the southern half of Europe brought exceptional temperatures across Spain, southern France, and NW Italy. Dry Foehn winds have resulted in extremely high early February values with locally 26-28 °C peak afternoon temperatures. Turin and Cuneo in NW Italy reached almost +27 °C – the hottest temperatures ever recorded in Piedmont region (NW Italy) during winter! Southern Switzerland stopped at +24 °C while Valencia reported +28.4 °C! That is *exceptional* for this period. There will be the final day of extreme warmth tomorrow before colder air mass spreads from the north and brings back winter with snow cold into the Balkans through mid-week.







The TOP-100 highest temperatures across Europe on Feb 3rd, 2020 – most of the highest temperatures were recorded across Spain, Portugal, S France, and Italy:

Over the Iberian peninsula the temperatures locally climbed even higher than in the previous two days, Valencia hit +28.4 °C! Santander / Parayas reported +27.8 °C, Huercal Overa, and Zumaya – faro hit +27.3 °C. The Italian station Capo Bellavista (on the eastern part of Sardinia island) hit +27.0 °C and Torino / Caselle reported +26.7 °C! Also, southern France was exceptional – Biarritz hit +26.6 °C! Foehn winds also brought a remarkable +23.9 °C to Grono and Magadino / Cadenazzo in southern Switzerland. It was also very warm all over the Mediterranean and most of the Balkans again, except some of the lowlands/valleys where thermal inversion was holding temperatures lower – many stations reported 18-22 °C.

Peak daytime temperatures across Europe with regional maps as well:

Zoomed maps over southeastern and southwestern France; +25 to almost +27 °C in some areas! Notice also +27.8 °C in Santader, N Spain where southerly Foehn winds have helped temperatures to reach such high values:

"How Reality Stopped Mattering in America—How Does a Society End Up in as Deep Denial About Authoritarianism, Fascism, and Collapse as America is?",https://eand.co/how-reality-stopped-mattering-in-america-b5c875ad5fa1,"When I look at America, when my friends from around the world look at America, we see the same thing. It makes us drop our jaws and shake our heads. How can a society be so deep in denial?

Let me explain what I mean.

There’s a President who’s recently “banned” entire countries from entering the country. Just yesterday, his administration purged a whistleblower, a career public servant, who testified against them. That was after being “acquitted” of conviction by a Senate that openly said…despite committing the crimes…they wouldn’t find him guilty anyways. And then said President proceeded to launch vitriolic tirades against…everyone. Opposition leaders, media, critics, adversaries.

This is the stuff of genuine authoritarianism. And fascism. Not kind-of-maybe-one-day-possibly. But the real thing, here and now. Yes, really. And yet there Americans are — deafeningly silent. Either they’re playing dumb, or…they really are. Maybe not you. But it’s easy to see that culturally, socially, intellectually, America isn’t ready to admit the plight it’s in. As a society, as a culture, America is in deep, profound denial about what it’s really going through, what it faces.

American denial about the authoritarian-fascist nature of its own collapse is the deepest I think I’ve ever seen, in decades of studying societies, politics, and economics. I don’t think I’ve seen a society confronted by abuses so strong they rise — obviously — to the level of authoritarianism and fascism…and yet being so shatteringly, deafeningly silent about it. So what explains America’s deafening silence?

I don’t think that Americans understand the logic of denial, or its consequences. I don’t think they get why reality (really) matters, or why truth (genuinely) counts. I don’t think that anybody’s ever taught them. That’s because, as we’ll see, truth itself is a liability in a capitalist society (but I’ll come to all that.)

You see, it’s no good calling authoritarians and fascists mere crooks and liars. They are much more than those things. To deny is to minimize and erase. And when authoritarianism and fascism are denied, therefore minimized and erased — they have never existed. But when they have never existed, who can be held to account for them? How can a society unite to oppose the true adversary? Who is going to try them and resist them and defy them? The answer is: no society can resist or reject or fight or overcome a thing that isn’t happening in the first place.

Americans often say, these days, that “reality doesn’t matter.” And they point to the President’s endless, obvious, flagrant lies. But the problem is not just the President. The problem is Americans, too. It’s not just the Prez and his minions who deny reality. So do Americans. They are denying reality every day by refusing to name their everyday horrors for what they are, and therefore confront reality. Paper-checking? Concentration camps? Purges? Come now. When authoritarianism and fascism are made unreal — when they have never happened, and therefore don’t exist — that is when authoritarians and fascists can create whichever reality they like. Reality has stopped mattering — but it is a larger social acquiescence that has made it so.

When I say “nobody says these words”, I mean that no major group, faction, coalition, or institution does. And that’s easy to observe. The New York Times doesn’t. The Democrats don’t. The Washington Post doesn’t. I could go on. These words are missing from American public discourse because they are simply unsaid.

But if you can’t say the highest-level words — authoritarianism, fascism — then, by definition, you also can’t say “concentration camps” or “genocide” or “crimes against humanity” or “propaganda” and so on. Americans can’t say those words either. That’s not a coincidence — it’s a relationship. But because nobody, really, can say these words, at the level of a social group, faction, or coalition — none of these things exist. America doesn’t have concentration camps. It doesn’t commit crimes against humanity in them. It doesn’t purge whistleblowers. It doesn’t have a regime using propaganda to twist and bend the populace to its will. None of these things exist — because at the highest level, nobody can say authoritarianism or fascism. It’s hardly a surprise then that nobody is accountable for what has never happened, or that these violations go on and on, or that the bad guys continue to accumulate and abuse. power

“Our economic woes are the fault of those subhumans! Those dirty, filthy, parasites. They’re the reason our society’s collapsed.” That bending and twisting of reality is made possible when — and only when — a society refuses, collectively, to name it as fascism and authoritarianism. Then reality can be whatever serves the purposes of the predators.

When nobody is willing to speak reality, then of course reality will become whatever the most violent and abusive and hateful dictate it to be. Those people will become subhumans. That law will be flouted. This minority will be scapegoated and hated. What else can result but the construction of a fabricated reality when a whole society is silent about what are, at this point, its most basic, obvious sociopolitical truths? Those aren’t concentration camps? But if they are, how come I’ve never heard the word on the nightly news?

Like Orwell, Arendt, Levi, Frankl, and an endless list of great minds taught, when truths don’t exist, nobody can be held accountable for what never happened in the first place, much less oppose or resist it. When a people themselves deny the existence of it happening here…that is the final condition necessary for it to happen here.

Now, Americans struggle profoundly with this logic. They just can’t seem to grasp it. They fight it, tooth and nail — imagining themselves above it. They seem unable to grasp this chains of causes and effects at all. When you try to teach them about it, they will insult you and taunt you and get angry at you. Their defenses rise, in other words. You are asking them to confront reality they can’t handle — and that, they aren’t capable of.

Now, the rest of this essay is going to be pointless theory and explanation. So let me give you a shortcut to the point. It’s not enough to blame a demagogue for being a pathological liar, or even being a demagogue. If Americans want to reclaim reality — the first genuine step in recovering a shattered democracy — then they must begin by telling truths themselves, not merely castigate the bad man for his lies. They must admit and acknowledge what they are up against. Authoritarianism and fascism. Not just crooks and lies and criminals and so forth. A common pickpocket or theif doesn’t put kids in cages in a camp, or ban whole countries, my friends. Why can’t Americans tell that simple truth?

Americans have to tell the truth about authoritarian and fascist collapse to each other and themselves, instead of merely condemning the lies. Otherwise, the deficit of truth in society is never allayed, with more of it — and democracy goes right on withering, as reality dies. Otherwise, what has never happened can hardly be fought or resisted. That is why silence and denial equal complicity — which is the handmaiden of every social collapse.

Now for the pointless theory and explanation.

How did Americans come to this point? After all, they read Orwell and Arendt and so on in high school. So why don’t they seem to get the message?

Let me put that another way.

What the deafening silence of Americans regarding the obvious meltdown of their society into authoritarianism and fascism says is this. Silence and denial have become social norms. You can’t say the words, utter the truths. It’s not happening here.

Hence, Americans end up playing a bizarre game of self-created impotence. They get angry at the Prez and his minions, and rage and scream at them on Twitter and Facebook. But without speaking these simple truths, they’re impotent. And so their rage goes nowhere.

Americans don’t seem to understand that this is what moral weakness is. This is what corrosion as a human being is. Being unable to speak these basic truths — at the precise moment they need to be spoken. What really troubles most Americans is if a) you rage at some politician but b) also say fascism or authoritarianism. Then they get really, really mad. The situation isn’t just bizarre — it’s telling. You’ve broken the rules. You’ve violated the norms of denial and silence. You are a bad person in their eyes. It’s in that sense that I mean: Americans don’t really grasp that failing to speak the truth is a kind of profound moral weakness.

You see, Americans live in an upside down moral universe. The strong survive, and the weak perish. So to show any kind of mercy or compassion in America is to be weak, and nobody wants to be weak, because if you’re weak, well, you die. So sure, they might give a few bucks in charity on Sunday — but come Monday, they’re hard at work, trying to outcompete, outdo, out consume the next person. In this moral universe, truth has no value, worth, purpose, or meaning.

Let me put that another way. America is a capitalist society. And to capitalism, the truth is a liability. The CEO cooks his books. The “hedge fund manager” wants to trade on insider information. You don’t say what you’re actually doing at work — checking Facebook, maybe. You wear your makeup and puff up your muscles and get that boob job. The truth is a liability in a capitalist society. It’s not profitable to capitalist institutions. It’s deeply undesirable to status competition. Telling your truth, for example — I’m suffering, I’m hurting, I’m in so much pain — is vastly unpreferable to going to the gym and puffing up those biceps or putting on some more makeup, and getting people to fear, desire, envy you.

A capitalist society, in other words, develops a certain kind of norm regarding the truth. It doesn’t tell it very much. It doesn’t respect it, value it, cherish it, ennoble it. The truth is something to be hidden away. Whether our truths, as individuals, the truth, as a society.

That truth is a liability is easy to see in America, too. How many other countries have started…wars…based on…lies? How many other nations have flooded their own cities with crack? How many other nations have assassinated most of their own most promising leaders? How many had a constitution literally making people subhumans? There are a few, to be sure, but not many. And they’re certainly not rich ones. You can America’s disdain for truth wherever you look — if you care to, that is. From the days of slavery to now, America’s never had much appetite for truth. It’s gone along with the lie — those people are subhumans and they should be our slaves, or those people have WMDs and they should be killed, or those commies will rule the world unless we do, and so on. It’s all the same thing, really: the truth is dangerous, and we’ll settle for the lie instead. Why is that?

In a capitalist society, there must never be anything that’s shared. But truth is the most fundamental thing we all share. Yet in a capitalist society, there is no truth, precisely because nothing is allowed that’s shared to begin with. The truth is communist — or at the very least, socialist. You don’t get to own it, possess it, buy it, sell it, trade it. We all share it, or it doesn’t exist at all. But we all know that communists are meant to be killed.

That is why Americans are so uncomfortable with the truth: it’s communism, socialism, everything they’ve been taught to despise. Why there’s something in them that resists it deeply, why they go along with bizarre things like wars based on lies and crackpot ideas like armed teachers or wasting their lives going to the gym forever instead of just admitting how unhappy and lonely they are. That something is the internalized figure of capitalism, which has taught them that lies are much more thrilling, pleasurable, exciting. Only the lie can make you desirable, envied, strong, powerful, feared — the truth is simply humble, human, fragile, small.

To tell the truth in a capitalist society — or a supremacist one — is weakness, and weakness is death. Truth is something inconvenient that just gets in the way of being perfect, strong, and powerful, which is what Americans have been taught they have to be, or else. Or else what? They die, more or less. Nobody has ever really taught them: not telling the truth is badly corrosive, to selfhood, freedom, morality, societies, to life, to democracy. Soon enough, all those things stop existing without truth.

Hence, Americans don’t say “this is fascism, this is authoritarianism”, because they don’t grasp just how corrosive, how damaging, how self-destructive it is to fail to speak basic moral truths. Why not lie, when everything around has always been based on a lie, whether slavery, capitalism, war, or inequality? Do you even know what truth is when everything around you has been a lie? What does the truth matter, anyways, if the only way people respect or admire you is for your pecs, boobs, bank account, title, possessions? What is a person, anyways? Perhaps you see my point a little bit.

That’s why Americans are satisfied with getting angry and shouting at the Prez for being a criminal or a scoundrel — my, how exciting and pleasing that is. What a catharsis it gives. The truth? What does it matter? Who cares? Moral corrosion is somethign they’ve normalized, without knowing it at all.

Yet the lie is always more pleasing than the truth. It takes maturity and courage and wisdom to tell the truth — whereas the lie is tempting precisely because it’s seductive and thrilling and exhilarating. Capitalism has taught Americans to lie about everything, beginning with themselves, to everyone, beginning with themselves, for that reason: it’s pleasing — even though it’s corrosive. By now, Americans can’t even admit their own feelings — that’s terrifying, being so vulnerable — so how are they going to own up to a society that ended up going fascist-authoritarian?

Hence, the bizarre position America finds itself in now. Every single day, abuses of power that go way, way beyond the most basic criteria necessary to say “this is fascism, this is authoritarianism” occur. They occur more and more frequently, and more and more violently. Banning whole countries? Purging whistleblowers? Camps and walls? Formalized dehumanization, by the head of state?

Come now. Every sixth grader is capable of knowing: America now passes all the basic criteria for budding fascism and authoritarianism. So why don’t Americans? Because the truth is a liability — and the lie is so much more pleasing. Because moral corrosion isn’t something they have ever been taught about — just self-interest, pleasure, and the priority of appearances on the surface.

Yet because they can’t even grasp that much — how are they then to make the logical step? “If I can’t tell this truth, this thing has never happened, so nobody can be held accountable for it, it never existed at all, and therefore I have no power over it. Me pretending this away is a kind of moral weakness, like any lie. But this lie has the power to destroy my society.” You see, denying that fascism and authoritarianism now are in charge of their society, Americans can scarcely then understand the consequences of denial.

But the consequences of denial are all too easy to see. It keeps on happening here. Just as it has been.

"Bottle-fed babies swallow millions of microplastics a day, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/19/bottle-fed-babies-swallow-millions-microplastics-day-study,"Bottle-fed babies are swallowing millions of microplastic particles a day, according to research described as a “milestone” in the understanding of human exposure to tiny plastics.

Scientists found that the recommended high-temperature process for sterilising plastic bottles and preparing formula milk caused bottles to shed millions of microplastics and trillions of even smaller nanoplastics.

The polypropylene bottles tested make up 82% of the world market, with glass bottles being the main alternative. Polypropylene is one of the most commonly used plastics and preliminary tests by the scientists found kettles and food containers also produced millions of microplastics per litre of liquid.

Microplastics in the environment were already known to contaminate human food and drink, but the study shows that food preparation in plastic containers can lead to exposure thousands of times higher.

The health impacts are unknown and the scientists say there is an “urgent need” to assess the issue, particularly for infants. The team has also produced sterilisation guidelines to reduce microplastic exposure.

Prof John Boland, at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, said “we were absolutely gobsmacked” at the number of microplastics produced by the baby bottles. “A study last year by the World Health Organization estimated adults would consume between 300 and 600 microplastics a day – our average values were on the order of a million or millions.”

He added: “We have to start doing the health studies to understand the implications. We’re already working with colleagues to look at what buttons in the immune system these particles begin to press.”

He said many of the particles would simply be excreted but further investigation was needed into how many could be absorbed into the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body.

“I’ve already gotten rid of all those [food] containers I used to use and if I had young children I would modify how I prepare [milk formula],” Boland said. “The message is the precautionary principle.”

Philipp Schwabl, at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria and not part of the research team, said: “These findings represent an important milestone. The scale of microplastic exposure presented here may seem alarming, but the real-world effects on infant health require further investigation.”

Prof Oliver Jones, at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, noted the babies’ exposure levels were estimates, not measurements: “We should not be making parents feel bad for using plastic bottles. However, this study illustrates that the microplastics problem is likely much bigger than we think [and] something we need to start really getting to grips with.”

People were already known to consume microplastics via food and water, and to breathe them in. In particular, tea brewed using plastic-based teabags and drinking water sold in plastic bottles have been found to contain microplastics. Scientists are concerned that microplastics may carry pathogens or toxic chemicals into the body.

Revealed: microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers Read more

Microplastics from plastic waste have polluted the entire planet, from Arctic snow and Alpine soils to the deepest oceans. But Prof Liwen Xiao at Trinity College said: “Our study indicates that plastic products are an important source of microplastics, meaning the routes of exposure are much closer to us than previously thought.”

The research, published in the journal Nature Food, began with an accidental finding when one researcher who was developing filters found they kept getting clogged with microplastics. These were subsequently traced back to polypropylene lab equipment.

The team followed international sterilisation guidelines to make baby formula in 10 different feeding bottles. This involves sterilising with 95C (203F) water, then shaking the formula powder with 70C water in the bottle.

Both the hot water and shaking steps produced a lot of microplastics, which are far smaller than the width of a human hair. Nanoplastics are so small they are very hard to count, but the scientists estimated trillions were produced per litre of fluid.

The scientists combined their experimental data with rates of bottle-feeding and milk intake in 48 regions, covering three-quarters of the global population. On average, they estimated that babies are exposed to 1.6m microplastic particles a day during their first year when fed using plastic bottles. The US, Australia and European countries had the highest levels – more than 2m particles per day, due to higher levels of bottle feeding.

The scientists suggest an additional washing step can cut the microplastics produced during usual formula preparation. Water boiled in a non-plastic container and then cooled is used to rinse the bottle three times after sterilisation. The formula is also made in a non-plastic container, then cooled and poured into the clean bottle.

“That will dramatically reduce the number of microplastics,” said Boland. “The last thing we want is to unduly alarm parents, particularly when we don’t have sufficient information on the potential [health] consequences. However, we are calling on policymakers to reassess the current guidelines for formula preparation when using plastic infant feeding bottles.”

Other solutions include using glass bottles, though these are heavier for babies to hold and are breakable, and developing tough new coatings to prevent plastics shedding particles.

Boland said plastics were “wonderful” materials with many useful applications: “So the reality is they’re here to stay and we will have to make them safer and more resilient.”"

Report: Average American Must Have Life Ruined By Natural Disaster Every 6 Minutes To Fear Climate Change,https://www.theonion.com/report-average-american-must-have-life-ruined-by-natur-1836604584,"EUGENE, OR—Outlining what a shift in public consciousness regarding global ecocatastrophe might require, a study published by researchers at the University of Oregon Monday found the average American must have their life destroyed by a natural disaster every six minutes in order to finally fear climate change. “According to our data, American citizens must lose their home to a flash flood, almost immediately watch a tornado ravage their hometown, and then succumb to heatstroke in 110 degree temperatures before recognizing climate change as a viable threat,” said head researcher and professor Vanessa Verrier, citing the tendency of U.S. citizens to forget about global warming roughly 10 minutes after their homes were devastated by wildfires. “Roughly seven minutes following a climate disaster, ambivalence sets in and Americans forget why these natural disasters have increased so dramatically in recent years. The good news, however, is that in the five minutes directly after losing a loved one in a hurricane, participants were much more likely to consider reducing their carbon footprint by taking public transit rather than driving.” The report estimated that the nation would have to suffer 34,000 consecutive natural disasters this month in order to garner significant support for climate change legislation.

"Fates of humans and insects intertwined, warn scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/20/fates-humans-insects-intertwined-scientists-population-collapse,"The “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, scientists have said, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”.

The warning has been issued by 25 experts from around the world, who acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species. However, enough was understood to warrant immediate action, they said, because waiting for better data would risk irreversible damage.

The researchers said solutions were available and must be implemented immediately. These range from bigger nature reserves and a crackdown on harmful pesticides to individual action such as not mowing the lawn and leaving dead wood in gardens. They also said invertebrates must no longer be neglected by conservation efforts, which tend to focus on mammals and birds.

The alert has been published as two articles in the Biological Conservation journal.

“The current [insect] extinction crisis is deeply worrisome. Yet, what we know is only the tip of the iceberg,” the scientists write. “We know enough to act immediately. Solutions are now available – we must act upon them.”

“Insect declines lead to the loss of essential, irreplaceable services to humanity. Human activity is responsible for almost all current insect population declines and extinctions.”

Insect population collapses have been reported in Germany, Puerto Rico and elsewhere. The first global scientific review, published in February 2019, said widespread declines threatened to cause a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. Insects pollinate three-quarters of crops, and another recent study showed widespread losses of such insects across Britain.

The report notes that only about a fifth of the world’s insect species have even been named, mostly from only single specimens.

“Many insect species are going extinct even before being described,” the researchers said. “It is likely that insect extinctions since the industrial era are around 5-10%, ie 250,000 to 500,000 species.”

This estimate is based on the extinctions of land snails. Prof Pedro Cardoso, at the Finnish Museum of Natural History and the lead author of the latest report, said: “It is the best estimate we have. There is no reason to think the trends are different between insects and land snails, but snails leave their shells behind as evidence.”

The paper also notes that British butterfly and beetle populations were said to be “fast disappearing” in the 1870s by the entomologist Archibald Swinton.

Long-term data on insect populations is rare. “We don’t know everything – in fact we know very little – but if we wait until we have better information to act it might be too late to recover many species,” Cardoso said.

“Many species are declining, probably the majority, and overall it seems the trend is for a large decline. But there are of course some species that are benefitting, for example the swarms of locusts currently in east Africa.”

Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of the conservation group Buglife, said a key report in 2016 told world governments that declines in wild pollinators presented risks to societies and ecosystems.

“However, in a repeat of the failure of politicians to respond to scientific warnings about climate change, the cautious, scientific language used has not produced an appropriate response from governments,” he said.

“Scientists are now turning up the heat on insect declines in the hope that politicians will understand the urgency and the link to human survival, and will take action before it is too late.”

The key causes of insect losses, according to the scientists, are the destruction of natural habitat for farming and buildings; the intensive use of pesticides; industrial pollution and light pollution; and invasive alien species; and the climate crisis.

Light pollution is key 'bringer of insect apocalypse' Read more

As well as large-scale solutions, Cardoso said insect-friendly gardens could help halt the decline. “When lots of people implement these small solutions, it can make a big difference to many insect populations. Even a couple of gardens could be a big thing for a species.”

He said a change of mindset was also needed because many people had learned to dislike insects. “I’ve never seen any small children – two, three or four years old – who were afraid of insects or spiders. It is cultural.”"
"Study finds at least 2 hours per week in pure, untouched nature is beneficial for human health. As people of r/collapse we carry a heavy psychological burden so it's important to remember to stay in touch with nature. This planet we live, and the bountiful life around us, are freaking amazing.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190613095227.htm,"Spending at least two hours a week in nature may be a crucial threshold for promoting health and wellbeing, according to a new large-scale study.

Research led by the University of Exeter, published in Scientific Reports and funded by NIHR, found that people who spend at least 120 minutes in nature a week are significantly more likely to report good health and higher psychological wellbeing than those who don't visit nature at all during an average week. However, no such benefits were found for people who visited natural settings such as town parks, woodlands, country parks and beaches for less than 120 minutes a week.

The study used data from nearly 20,000 people in England and found that it didn't matter whether the 120 minutes was achieved in a single visit or over several shorter visits. It also found the 120 minute threshold applied to both men and women, to older and younger adults, across different occupational and ethnic groups, among those living in both rich and poor areas, and even among people with long term illnesses or disabilities.

Dr Mat White, of the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the study, said: ""It's well known that getting outdoors in nature can be good for people's health and wellbeing but until now we've not been able to say how much is enough. The majority of nature visits in this research took place within just two miles of home so even visiting local urban greenspaces seems to be a good thing. Two hours a week is hopefully a realistic target for many people, especially given that it can be spread over an entire week to get the benefit.""

There is growing evidence that merely living in a greener neighbourhood can be good for health, for instance by reducing air pollution. The data for the current research came from Natural England's Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment Survey, the world's largest study collecting data on people's weekly contact with the natural world.

Co-author of the research, Professor Terry Hartig of Uppsala University in Sweden said: ""There are many reasons why spending time in nature may be good for health and wellbeing, including getting perspective on life circumstances, reducing stress, and enjoying quality time with friends and family.

High levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia, prompting concern among researchers that a new climate feedback loop may have been triggered that could accelerate the pace of global heating.

The slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases – known as hydrates. Methane has a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years. The United States Geological Survey has previously listed Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change.

The international team onboard the Russian research ship R/V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere.

“At this moment, there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming, but the point is that this process has now been triggered. This East Siberian slope methane hydrate system has been perturbed and the process will be ongoing,” said the Swedish scientist Örjan Gustafsson, of Stockholm University, in a satellite call from the vessel.

Quick Guide Methane and the Arctic Show Why are methane hydrates considered 'sleeping giants' for the climate? Scientists estimate 1,400 gigatonnes of carbon are locked up in subsea hydrates (frozen methane and other gases) under Arctic submarine permafrost, some of which could be vulnerable to global heating. If large volumes were released, this could rapidly destabilise the climate because methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Such concerns led the United States Geological Survey to list Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change. This possibility – sometimes referred to as the 'clathrate gun hypothesis' – has been the basis for doomsday scenarios of runaway warming that tips the Earth towards a hothouse state. However, several studies suggest such fears are exaggerated.



That sounds scary. When could it happen? There are many uncertainties: at what temperature will hydrates destabilise and, if they do, how fast will it happen; and will the gas bubbles reach the surface and be released into the atmosphere or simply dissolve in the oceans? These and other questions are now the subject of intense research on the shelf and slopes of the Laptev Sea and other areas of the Arctic.



The scientists – who are part of a multi-year International Shelf Study Expedition – stressed their findings were preliminary. The scale of methane releases will not be confirmed until they return, analyse the data and have their studies published in a peer-reviewed journal.

But the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns that a new tipping point has been reached that could increase the speed of global heating.

The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits in the ocean.

With the Arctic temperature now rising more than twice as fast as the global average, the question of when – or even whether – they will be released into the atmosphere has been a matter of considerable uncertainty in climate computer models.

The 60-member team on the Akademik Keldysh believe they are the first to observationally confirm the methane release is already under way across a wide area of the slope about 600km offshore.

At six monitoring points over a slope area 150km in length and 10km wide, they saw clouds of bubbles released from sediment.

At one location on the Laptev Sea slope at a depth of about 300 metres they found methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre, which is 400 times higher than would be expected if the sea and the atmosphere were in equilibrium.

Igor Semiletov, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is the chief scientist onboard, said the discharges were “significantly larger” than anything found before. “The discovery of actively releasing shelf slope hydrates is very important and unknown until now,” he said. “This is a new page. Potentially they can have serious climate consequences, but we need more study before we can confirm that.”

The most likely cause of the instability is an intrusion of warm Atlantic currents into the east Arctic. This “Atlantification” is driven by human-induced climate disruption.

The latest discovery potentially marks the third source of methane emissions from the region. Semiletov, who has been studying this area for two decades, has previously reported the gas is being released from the shelf of the Arctic – the biggest of any sea.

For the second year in a row, his team have found crater-like pockmarks in the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that are discharging bubble jets of methane, which is reaching the sea surface at levels tens to hundreds of times higher than normal. This is similar to the craters and sinkholes reported from inland Siberian tundra earlier this autumn.

Temperatures in Siberia were 5C higher than average from January to June this year, an anomaly that was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. Last winter’s sea ice melted unusually early. This winter’s freeze has yet to begin, already a later start than at any time on record."

The crisis is hitting the likes of airlines and high street retailers particularly hard, and is decimating many small businesses. Unfortunately, this is proving devastating for millions of precarious and low-income workers across the world.

Many governments – including the UK and the US – have announced fiscal stimulus packages, including tax relief, to individuals and business. Such measures are welcome, but our new research suggests that they should be understood against broader shifts in the tax regime which leave society less able to withstand the pandemic.

As we show by looking at American companies, these shifts reinforce inequality not only between large and small firms but also between high and low-income households. The result is a fraying social fabric through which the coronavirus can spread rapidly.

The big discount

The graph below maps the worldwide effective tax rate – the rate that is really paid as opposed to any rate set by governments – for US non-financial corporations listed on the stock market. The dark grey bars show the average tax rate of the top 10% of corporations ranked by revenues, while the light grey bars show the bottom 90%. The line above the bars shows the ratio of the tax rate of the top 10% relative to the bottom 90%.

Worldwide effective tax rates

Sandy Hager/Joseph Baines

This shows that the worldwide tax system was progressive in the 1970s, with the largest corporations paying slightly higher rates than the smaller ones. By the mid-1980s the system had turned sharply regressive and has stayed so ever since. For 2015-18, smaller listed corporations were effectively paying a 41% rate on their profits, while larger corporations paid 28%.

What accounts for this persistent tax advantage for larger corporations? Are they gaming the domestic system? Or do they enjoy a foreign tax advantage because they have the resources to evade taxes and shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions? To address these questions, we compared the tax rate on domestic income to the rate on foreign income.

The graphs below looks at how much US corporations really pay in taxes to different authorities. Again comparing the largest 10% corporations with the rest, the top left graph focuses on tax payments in the US as a whole. The top right graph drills down to US federal taxes while the graph on the bottom left is for the total taxes paid to US states. These three graphs show that the entire domestic system of taxes, both federally and at state level, has been persistently biased towards large corporations since the mid-1980s.

Effective tax rates by jurisdiction

Sandy Hager/Joseph Baines

This is different to what American corporations pay to other countries, as shown in the graph labelled “foreign” in the bottom right-hand corner. This rate has fallen dramatically for larger and smaller corporations alike, fitting the conventional wisdom that tax competition has intensified with globalisation. Until as recently as the end of the 1990s, however, the foreign tax structure in the US was progressive, meaning that the largest corporations were paying more. This has now reversed, just like it did for domestic taxes several decades earlier.

Concentration and inequality

Why should we care if big business has a persistent tax advantage? One problem is that the tax system encourages businesses to concentrate into bigger and bigger entities. In recent years there have been growing concerns about the dominance of big business in advanced economies, including the US. Studies show that as large corporations take greater shares of revenues, profits and assets, they also charge higher prices, pay lower wages, provide lower quality goods and services, and scale back innovation and investment.

Most policy debate has focused on governments rolling back antitrust legislation to remedy this concentration of businesses. Our research suggests that, at minimum, corporate tax should be part of this conversation: the global tax system rewards corporations for reaching a size that is actually bad for society. This may include impeding our ability to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.

Take the notoriously concentrated pharmaceuticals sector, which was already being blamed for a growing problem of drug shortages well before the arrival of the pandemic – partly due to business decisions to discontinue old products that wereren’t profitable enough. Lobbyists for big pharma were also successful in blocking provisions in a new US$8.3 billion (£6.7 billion) coronavirus emergency spending bill that would tackle unfair pricing and thus threaten companies’ intellectual property rights over essential medicines.

The tax advantage of big business also helps to widen household inequality. Supporters often claim that tax savings allow business to expand productive capacity, employment and wages, and therefore create widespread prosperity. Yet our research shows that as the rate they effectively pay declines worldwide, large corporations scale back their capital expenditures.

If large corporations aren’t using their tax windfall to expand productive capacity, what are they doing with it? According to our findings, they are enriching their shareholders.

In the 1970s, large corporations allocated 30 cents toward dividend payments and stock buybacks for every dollar of capital expenditure. From 2010-18, the amount they spent on enriching their shareholders had jumped to 93 cents.

This surge wouldn’t be such a problem if share ownership was widely dispersed, but it’s not. The top 1% of US households own, either directly or indirectly, 40% of all corporate shares, and the top 10% of households own 84%.

So the corporate tax regime has fuelled inequality, which is an important vector for the spread of the coronavirus. Many people on lower incomes are forced to make the wrenching choice between going into work and potentially contracting and spreading the coronavirus, or staying at home and failing to make ends meet.

The government measures for individuals and small businesses are a welcome - but by no means sufficient - attempt at ameliorating problems that the regressive tax regime has helped to create. Let’s also use this crisis as an opportunity to reform the tax system in ways that help tackle inequality and reduce corporate concentration."

US stocks plunged deeper into the red on Thursday after President Donald Trump's address to the nation on Wednesday night failed to calm investors' concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

Selling was so pronounced in the opening minutes that a marketwide circuit breaker was enacted, halting trading for 15 minutes.

All three major US indexes fell roughly 7% in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq opened more than 20% below their recent highs, putting them in bear-market territory. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed in a bear market on Wednesday, extended losses.

Trump's remarks about the coronavirus outbreak — which lacked clarity about economic stimulus measures — spurred overnight futures losses that carried into Thursday trading. Trump also announced a 30-day European travel ban, adding to trepidation as airline stocks tumbled.

Study: 71 percent of jobless Americans did not receive their March unemployment benefits,http://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-economy-recession-stock-market/2020/4/25/21236595/unemployment-benefits-71-percent-didnt-recieve-coronavirus-layoffs,"The majority of unemployed Americans did not receive unemployment benefits in March — a month that shattered US records for job loss claims — according to a new study.

The Pew Research Center has found that, although more than 11 million Americans filed first-time unemployment claims in March, the wide variety of methods states and territories use to administer their jobless programs have resulted in wide disparities in who has received their payments, and how much those payments were worth.

As a result, only 29 percent of jobless Americans received benefits in March, according to Pew’s analysis of Labor Department statistics. The disbursement rate of unemployment payments was found to vary widely, with nearly 66 percent of unemployed Massachusetts residents receiving their benefits, compared to only 7.6 percent of unemployed Florida residents.

The federal CARES Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package aimed at addressing coronavirus-related economic fallout, featured provisions meant to boost the size and scope of unemployment benefits. But it left the distribution of funds to the states — many of which have outdated, underfunded, and inefficient methods for enrolling the newly unemployed, as Vox’s Ella Nilsen has explained.

Also at issue, Pew notes, is those seeking support “face a hodgepodge of different state rules governing how they can qualify for benefits, how much they’ll get and how long they can collect them.”

For example, in some states, workers must wait a week before they can start collecting benefits. In others, workers who receive commission, rather than standard wages, are ineligible for aid. And, in many states, people may exhaust their benefits after a certain period of time — a scenario that is unworkable in a job market in which standard employment is largely on hold for the foreseeable future. (The CARES Act does extend the length of people’s eligibility for federal benefits after their state benefits run out, the study notes.)

These different scenarios result in regional disparities in who receives benefits — and mean that millions of those eligible did not, and perhaps still have not, received aid. By and large, the states where the fewest jobless people (under 15 percent) received benefits were in the South, and the states where the most jobless people (more than 40 percent) received benefits were in the Northeast and Midwest.

The amount of the benefits also varied widely, because states cap benefits in relation to a person’s earnings, at different amounts, from $235 per week in Mississippi to $823 per week in Massachusetts. Some states offer additional benefits for dependents; others don’t.

Even before this explosion of job loss, unemployment benefits were often hard to access, as many states’ administrative apparatuses went underfunded for years. All this comes at a time when Americans have said they need immediate support — more than half of low-income Americans report that they will have trouble paying bills this month. And nationwide, the economic fallout from the virus’s spread is on par with the Great Depression.

Now, paired with new hurdles, such as the rocky rollout of new programs and glitchy or purposefully inaccessible online portals, millions more Americans are seeing — and about to fall through — the gaping holes in the national safety net.

"Pesticide-contaminated nectar damages the brains of young bees, leading to older adult bees possessing smaller and functionally impaired brains, making them poorer at performing tasks later in life and likely contributing to the decline in global bee population, new research finds.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/world/baby-bees-brains-pesticides-scn/index.html,"The odds of spotting the hardworking pollinators in Europe and America down by more than 30% since the last century.

Pesticides, along with the climate crises and declining habitat, have been blamed for their declining numbers. And in a new study published Tuesday, scientists examined exactly how bumblebees are affected by pesticides by scanning bumble bee brains and testing their learning abilities.

They found that baby bees can feel the effects of the food contaminated by pesticides brought back by worker bees into the colony, making them poorer at performing tasks later in life.

Dr. Richard Gill, a senior lecturer in the Imperial College London's the Department of Life Sciences and an author of the study, compared it to how a fetus might be damaged by a harmful substance in the womb.

""Bee colonies act as superorganisms, so when any toxins enter the colony, these have the potential to cause problems with the development of the baby bees within it,"" he said

""Worryingly in this case, when young bees are fed on pesticide-contaminated food, this caused parts of the brain to grow less, leading to older adult bees possessing smaller and functionally impaired brains; an effect that appeared to be permanent and irreversible.""

The loss of bumblebees can contribute to decreasing biodiversity and potentially impact our food supply, with the bees pollinating plants such as cucumbers, tomatoes, squash, blueberries and melons.

Spiking nectar

In their experiment, the researchers spiked nectar with a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids at a similar concentration that's been found in wild flowers. Then they introduced it into a lab-based bee colony.

Once the baby bees emerged as adults, their learning ability was tested after three days, and again after 12 days. The results were compared with young bees from colonies that were fed no pesticides and those that were fed pesticides only as adults.

They found that bees that were fed pesticides when they were developing as larvae showed significantly impaired learning ability compared to those that were not. To determine this, the researchers tested if bees could learn to associate a smell with a food reward, scoring how many times out of 10 each successfully performed the task.

""There has been growing evidence that pesticides can build up inside bee colonies. Our study reveals the risks to individuals being reared in such an environment, and that a colony's future workforce can be affected weeks after they are first exposed,"" said Dylan Smith, also with the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial.

This impaired learning ability could make it harder for the worker bees to navigate and forage, Gill said, potentially imperiling the bee colony.

Examining bee brains

The researchers also scanned the brains of close to 100 bees involved in their study using new micro-CT scanning technology and found that those who had been exposed to pesticides had a smaller volume of an important part of the insect brain, known as the mushroom body.

""It's fantastic looking at the tiny structures just a few millimeters wide,"" Gill said.

The mushroom body is known to be involved in learning ability in insects, and poor performance on the learning task correlated with smaller mushroom body volume, supporting the suggestion that pesticide exposure is the cause of the bees' poor performance, the study said.

Gill said the research showed that the role pesticides may have played in the decline of bumble bees and other pollinators may have been underestimated, when compared with things like the climate crises and habitat loss.

""We are still trying to figure out what roles these factors play and how they interact,"" he said. ""Pesticides are definitely a contributing explanation to why we are seeing declines.""

""Pesticides are putting these colonies at risk. They are impairing foragers who then have to deal with land use change and extreme weather."""
"It looks like the dire predictions for 2100 are actually going to happen next year, 2021.",https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/2020/08/mosaic-climate-expedition-shares-scary-photos-north-pole,"Few photos are better proof of the climate crisis than those taken by the members of the MOSAiC expedition over the last few days. The Barents Observer has obtained permission to repost some of them, showing the current ice-cap on the top of the world.

The photos clearly underline how several recent climate studies, predicting ice-free Arctic summers by 2035, is not a theoretical scenario but rather an unavoidable fact.

The expedition ship Polarstern sailed from the northern Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard to the North Pole this week.

“I’m very surprised to see how soft and easy to traverse the ice up to 88° North is this year, having thawed to the point of being thin and porous,” said Captain Thomas Wunderlich.

“Even after passing 88° North we mostly maintained a speed of 5-7 knots; I’ve never seen that so far north,” the Polarstern captain said.

He added: “The current situation is historic.”

The MOSAiC expedition is the largest science voyage into polar waters in history. Sailing out of Tromsø in September 2019, the German icebreaker has so far nearly spent one year drifting through the Arctic Ocean. Last fall across the Barents Sea to north of Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya before sailing into the ice and drifting northwest during the polar night season.

Hundreds of researchers from 20 countries are involved gathering data aimed at getting a much better understanding of the Arctic climate impact.

Since sea ice drifts from north of Siberia across the Arctic Ocean to the Greenland, Canadian side, multiple year ice use to pack north of Greenland.

“Normally it’s wise to avoid the region north of Greenland, because it’s home to the thicker and older ice, and virtually impassable,” Polarstern captain Wunderlich explained.

“But now we’re finding extended stretches of open water, reaching nearly to the Pole.”

A study published last week in the journal Nature Climate Change could tell the serious negative path for Arctic summer sea ice. The study points to exactly what can be seen on the photos from this August’s MOSAiC voyage: The shallow pools of water form on the surface of the ice, so-called melt ponds, causes more sunlight to be absorbed instead of being reflected back into space as is the case with white-snow covered ice, the scientists said.

Meanwhile, Polarstern continues the research expedition towards east in direction of Siberia and plans for a stop in the ice at about 88° North.

Professor Markus Rex of the Alfred Wegner Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, is expedition leader.

“Depending on the ice conditions, however, we’ll also start looking for a suitable floe in the vicinity of the North Pole, so that we can start working on the ice as soon as possible,” Markus Rex explained.

The researchers’ priorities now will be the beginning of freezing and the early phase of ice formation as the Arctic autumn and winter season starts.

Polarstern took the shortest route north. On the way, the sea ice was surprisingly weak and the icebreaker easily broke through. Photo: Steffen Graupner / MOSAiC

The disturbing photos by this year’s MOSAiC expedition follows an escalating trend seen in the last few years.

The first surface vessel to reach the North Pole was the Soviet Union’s nuclear-powered icebreaker Arktika on August 17, 1977. On the 40 years anniversary of the voyage, in August 2017, the icebreaker 50 let pobedy sailed the same route from Murmansk to the North Pole in just 79 hours as reported by The Barents Observer at the time.

The voyage with Arktika took 176 hours, more than twice the time. Both icebreakers were powered by the same type of twin nuclear reactors."

Inaugural Global Health Security Index Finds Significant Gaps in Preparedness for Epidemics and Pandemics

Even high-income countries are found lacking and score only in the average range of preparedness

A new Global Health Security Index, the first comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of health security and related capabilities across 195 countries, suggests that not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic. The GHS Index is a joint project of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), with research by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). The Center for Health Security is a part of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The inaugural GHS Index finds severe weaknesses in countries’ abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to significant disease outbreaks. The average overall 2019 GHS Index score is slightly over 40 out of a possible score of 100. Among the 60 highest-income countries assessed, the average score is 51.9.

Jennifer Nuzzo, associate professor at the Bloomberg School and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security, said the GHS Index, developed with guidance from an International Panel of Experts from 13 countries, can be used by health ministers and international organizations, philanthropists and funders, academics and researchers.

“The GHS Index finds that no country is fully prepared for naturally occurring, intentional, or accidental infectious disease outbreaks,” Nuzzo said. “Knowing that there is work to do, countries can use the index to identify gaps, build preparedness and best practices, and track progress over time.”

“Whether they be natural, accidental, or deliberate, infectious disease outbreaks can cause significant harm to health, peace, and prosperity if countries are not adequately prepared,” said Center for Health Security director Tom Inglesby. “It is important for national leaders to understand the risks that infectious diseases pose and commit to making improvements in preparedness for these events.”

The GHS Index assessed countries across six categories, 34 indicators, and 140 questions, using only open-source information and data from international organizations, including the World Health Organization, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN), and the World Bank.

Top findings

The Index found that:

Fewer than 7 percent of countries score in the highest tier in the category assessing the prevention of the emergence or release of pathogens .

. Only 19 percent of countries receive top marks (scoring a 66.7 out of 100 or higher) in the category assessing early detection and reporting of epidemics of potential international concern.

of potential international concern. Fewer than 5 percent of countries score in the highest tier in rapid response to and mitigation of spread of an epidemic.

of an epidemic. With an average score of 26.4 out of 100, having a sufficient and robust health sector to treat the sick and protect health workers was the lowest-scoring category.

The GHS Index findings and recommendations for addressing significant gaps in global health security come amid an ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and five years after the UN Security Council met in crisis over the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

At a time when risks are magnified by a rapidly changing and interconnected world and rapid technology advances make it easier to create and engineer pathogens, knowing the risks is clearly not enough. Political will is needed to protect people from the consequence of epidemics, to take action to save lives, and to build a safer and more secure world.

Top recommendations

A core principle of the GHS Index is that health security is a collective responsibility. The GHS Index offers 33 recommendations for individual countries and for the international community. Recommendations include:

The UN Secretary-General should call a heads-of-state-level summit by 2021 on biological threats, including a focus on financing and emergency response.

or unit for high-consequence biological events. Countries should test their health security capacities and publish after-action reviews, at least annually.

and publish after-action reviews, at least annually. Governments and donors should take into account countries’ political and security risk factors when supporting health security capacity development.

The GHS Index was developed over two and a half years. Key steps included an initial pilot project to test the framework; reviews by the International Panel of Experts that includes 21 experts from 13 countries; a yearlong data collection and validation process by 110 EIU researchers and reviews throughout the world; and opportunities for governments to validate data.

The European Parliament declares climate emergency,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20191121IPR67110/the-european-parliament-declares-climate-emergency,"Ahead of the UN COP25 Climate Change Conference in Madrid 2-13 December, the Parliament on Thursday approved a resolution declaring a climate and environmental emergency in Europe and globally. They also want the Commission to ensure that all relevant legislative and budgetary proposals are fully aligned with the objective of limiting global warming to under 1.5 °C.

In a separate resolution, Parliament urges the EU to submit its strategy to reach climate neutrality as soon as possible, and by 2050 at the latest, to the UN Convention on Climate Change. MEPs also call on the new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to include a 55% reduction target of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in the European Green Deal.

Step up global emission reductions for aviation and shipping

MEPs say that current aviation and shipping ambitions fall short of the necessary emissions reductions. All countries should include emissions from international shipping and aviation in their national contributions plans (NDCs), they say, and urge the Commission to

propose that the maritime sector be included in the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS).

More financial support to fight climate change

EU countries should at least double their contributions to the international Green Climate Fund, Parliament says. EU member states are the largest providers of public climate finance and the EU’s budget should fully comply with its international commitments. They also note that pledges by developed countries do not meet the collective goal of 100 billion USD per year as of 2020.

Finally, they urgently call on all EU countries to phase out all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies by 2020.

Quote

“The European Parliament has just adopted an ambitious position in view of the upcoming COP 25 in Madrid. Given the climate and environmental emergency, it is essential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2030. It also sends a clear and timely message to the Commission a few weeks before the publication of the Communication on the Green Deal ""”, said Pascal Canfin (RE, FR), Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, during the debate on Monday.

Background

The resolution on declaring a climate and environmental emergency was adopted with 429 votes for, 225 votes against and 19 abstentions. The European Parliament adopted the resolution on COP25 with 430 votes for, 190 votes against and 34 abstentions.

A number of countries, local administrations and scientists have declared that our planet is facing a climate emergency.

The European Commission has already proposed the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but the European Council has still not endorsed it as Poland, Hungary and Czechia are opposed.

Parliament at the COP25

COP25 will take place in Madrid 2-13 December 2019. The President of the European Parliament David Maria Sassoli, (S&D, IT) will attend the official opening. A delegation from the European Parliament, led by Bas Eickhout (Greens, NL), will be there 9-14 December."
"New speed record: world is adding 10,000 reported corona cases per hour (1 million every 4 days)",https://news.yahoo.com/first-time-world-records-one-225607895.html,"By Gayle Issa

(Reuters) - Global coronavirus infections passed 14 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the first time there has been a surge of 1 million cases in under 100 hours.

The first case was reported in China in early January and it took three months to reach 1 million cases. It has taken just four days to climb to 14 million cases from 13 million recorded on July 13.

The United States, with more than 3.6 million confirmed cases, is still seeing huge daily jumps in its first wave of COVID-19 infections. The United States reported a daily global record of more than 77,000 new infections on Thursday, while Sweden has reported 77,281 total cases since the pandemic began.

Despite the surging cases, a cultural divide is growing in the country over wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, a precaution routinely taken in many other nations.

U.S. President Donald Trump and his followers have resisted a full-throated endorsement of masks and have been calling for a return to normal economic activity and reopening schools despite the surging cases.

Other hard-hit countries have “flattened the curve” and are easing lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of the novel virus while others, such as the cities of Barcelona and Melbourne, are implementing a second round of local shutdowns.

The number of cases globally is around triple that of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization.

The pandemic has now killed more than 590,000 people in almost seven months, edging towards the upper range of yearly influenza deaths reported worldwide. The first death was reported on Jan. 10 in Wuhan, China before infections and fatalities then surged in Europe and later in the United States.

The Reuters tally, which is based on government reports, shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in the Americas, which account for more than half the world’s infections and half its deaths.

Story continues

In Brazil, more than 2 million people have tested positive including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 76,000 people have died.

India, the only other country with more than 1 million cases, has been grappling with an average of almost 30,000 new infections each day for the last week.

Those countries were the main drivers behind the World Health Organization on Friday reporting a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases of 237,743.

In countries with limited testing capacity, case numbers reflect only a proportion of total infections. Experts say official data likely under-represents both infections and deaths.

More than 2 trillion litres of water — enough to fill Sydney Harbour four and a half times — has gone missing from Australia's largest and most precious river system — the Murray-Darling Basin.,"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-03/the-mystery-of-the-murray-darlings-vanishing-flows/12612166?nw=0#:~:text=More%20than%202%20trillion%20litres,%E2%80%94%20the%20Murray%2DDarling%20Basin.","The mystery of the Murray-Darling's vanishing flows

Updated

It might be the biggest whodunnit — or what-dunnit — in Australia.

More than 2 trillion litres of water — enough to fill Sydney Harbour four and a half times — has gone missing from our largest and most precious river system — the Murray-Darling Basin.

And it's happened in what was already one of the driest periods the basin has seen.

According to an investigation by some of Australia's top water scientists, shared exclusively with the ABC, 20 per cent of the water expected to flow down the rivers from 2012-2019 was simply not there. That's despite almost $7 billion being spent to protect the health of the system's rivers and ecosystems that rely on them.

Was it stolen? Was it lost? Has climate change made it go up in steam? Or was it simply never there in the first place?

There are clues scattered up and down the rivers but one simple message is clear in the scientists' findings. For the first time, they provide evidence that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan — the most expensive environmental program in Australia's history — is delivering much less water than was expected.

And the implications could be huge.

<->

It covers a seventh of the continent, is home to nearly 10 per cent of Australia's people, and produces a third of our food.

This enormous network of rivers, creeks, wetlands and valleys is what's known as the Murray-Darling Basin.

To save the struggling river system, by 2019, federal and state governments had spent $6.7 billion, recovering 2.1 trillion litres of water to put back into the rivers.

Now, for the first time, researchers from the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists have modelled what the river system was expected to look like in 2019. The Wentworth Group, established in 2002, is a group of eminent Australian scientists concerned with conservation.

These circles represent what should have been flowing past 27 flow gauges, based on Murray-Darling Basin Authority modelling and weather data from that year.

But this is what 2019 looked like in reality. There was much less water than expected.

And every year since 2012, a similar pattern has been seen.

Sometimes sites in the river system see more water than expected, but most see less. Some much less. And year after year, the volumes of missing water add up.

The scientists say the model showing what should be expected can struggle to accurately simulate years where flows are extremely low and that it performs better over longer periods than it does for a single year.

So after seven years, a full 20 per cent of the expected water in the entire system was not there. That's an average of 320 billion litres every year. And a total of more than 2 trillion litres of water.

Hover or tap on a circle to see more detail about each site.

""It's a huge discrepancy to be missing a fifth of the water that's meant to be in the rivers,"" said Jamie Pittock from the ANU. He's an expert in water management and a co-author of the Wentworth Group's report.

""It means that there are all sorts of things that Australians value that won't be sustained … like more water for towns … the floodplains, growing grass for sheep and cattle, in terms of biodiversity being conserved, waterbirds, red gum forests and conserving our fish.""

Rob Vertessy is a hydrologist and chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's (MDBA) Advisory Committee on Social Economic and Environmental Sciences.

He said the report was an important contribution to the body of scientific knowledge on the system.

""It is pointing to a problem, which I guess people have had a sense of, but which hasn't been properly dimensioned until now,"" Professor Vertessy said.

""The levels of flow in the river are lower than everyone would have hoped.""

The MDBA itself worked with the Wentworth Group to help with the analysis over the past several months, and is completing its own similar analysis set to be released later this year.

The MDBA's head of basin strategy, Vicki Woodburn, said the shortfall was not a failure of the basin plan itself, since it was still being implemented.

The missing water is a mystery — nobody knows exactly why it's not being seen in the rivers.

But here's the thing: there are clues. Lots of them. We've seen water go missing up and down the river with clear explanations before. And looking closely at the new report, many of those explanations are consistent with the new data.

Clue one: tampered meters and criminal prosecutions

One possible explanation for the shortfall is that some of the missing water has been stolen.

An investigation by Four Corners in 2017 put water theft in the spotlight — much of it around the Barwon-Darling catchment in the Northern Basin.

Irrigators there, according to official figures, use 3 per cent of all the water taken from the entire Murray-Darling Basin.

But on top of those official figures, there has been significantly more water taken in that area. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority itself estimated that in the Northern Basin, as little as 25 per cent of surface water take has been metered.

Some of the water that went unmetered was stolen.

Peter Harris, who was named in the 2017 Four Corners, was this year found guilty of water theft just upstream from those gauges at Brewarrina.

Anthony Barlow, another person named in the program, was found guilty and fined $190,000, for water theft just upstream again.

Since the Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR) was formed in NSW in 2018, 15 additional charges have been laid in these locations across the state for water theft and related actions, according to an NRAR spokeswoman.

Emma Carmody, a lawyer at the Environmental Defenders' Office, said the criminal prosecutions do not represent how widespread water theft has been.

""I'd actually go so far as to say that this situation pre-2018 was catastrophically bad in those northern catchments in relation to compliance and enforcement,"" Dr Carmody said.

Irrigators deny water theft is a significant issue in the missing water mystery.

""I think if people are saying, 'oh, well, this is about water theft', then what they're doing is really just trying to find someone to blame rather than trying to find solutions,"" said Steve Whan, the CEO of the National Irrigators' Council.

It's probably impossible now to calculate the true scale of water theft over the seven years analysed by the Wentworth Group, but it's unlikely to explain much of the shortfall. And whatever role it played, there are other key suspects in the case of the missing water.

Clue two: shadow take

Travel further upstream along the Macquarie River towards Dubbo, and you land in the internationally protected wetlands of the Macquarie Marshes.

It's one of the largest remaining inland, semi-permanent wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin and supports more than half a million birds in a large flood.

In the vast flat landscape, decent rains cause water to spill over the banks of the Macquarie and its tributaries and spread as far as the eye can see.

In a landscape so flat, structures like roads, engineered channels and small levee banks can divert staggering volumes of floodwater — potentially shepherding it across a farmer's fields where it is left to soak into the ground, or even pumped into dams.

This water taken by irrigators and graziers from the floodplains — rather than from the rivers — has hardly ever been measured.

Using satellite imagery, flood paths appear guided by seemingly innocuous structures, or completely cut off by others.

Richard Kingsford is a river ecologist at the University of New South Wales who has studied the Macquarie Marshes and the impacts of floodplain harvesting.

He says water that spills over floodplains often drains back into rivers, and interrupting its flow can have big impacts, including contributing to the missing flows.

""There are very few places where we have an accurate estimate of how much water is being taken from the floodplain. And to me, this has been a yawning gap in the policy,"" he said.

This floodplain harvesting was not always illegal — so long as the earthworks were approved and the total amounts taken were within certain limits. But without proper measurement, nobody can be sure, and the volumes taken were unknown.

The idea that floodplain harvesting could explain some of the missing water fits with the data in the Wentworth Group's report. In late 2016, there was a flood in some parts of the basin and despite there being much more water in that period, the shortfall remained high.

""During the wet sequences, which haven't been frequent … I think it's a matter of legitimate disquiet that many have about the failure to really bring those floodplain harvesting schemes into the calculations,"" says Professor Vertessy.

""It's well past the time that we should have a full fix on that,"" he said.

In NSW, where the potential for floodplain harvesting is the biggest, rules are now being implemented to measure it.

Steve Whan from the National Irrigators' Council said the new rules would help reduce shortfalls in future analyses.

""We're seeing extensive work done to improve measurement, including bringing floodplain harvesting into a volumetric system … And all those things are really important steps. Many of them are still only partway through,"" Mr Whan said.

Clue Three: The cash splash

If we head all the way to southern NSW, we see a completely different clue.

Billions have been spent subsidising ""efficiency measures"" to help farmers save water there.

That can be done by upgrading old irrigation systems to deliver water directly to roots, or lining water channels, for example. Then about half of the water saved by the farmers gets handed to the government for the environment.

But according to some experts, the ""inefficiencies"" prior to the upgrades just meant some of the water used by irrigators flowed back into the rivers. The upgrades mean that ""return flow"" stops happening.

""So when you say 'I've saved all this water', the question is what was it doing before it was saved?"" said John Williams, another co-author of the Wentworth Group report and former head of the CSIRO's Division of Land and Water.

In a report published in 2019, Professor Williams estimated that at least 280 billion litres of water per year might have been lost from the rivers — and are unaccounted for — due to this problem.

""That must be a major reason that we're not getting the flow regimes that we need,"" Professor Williams said.

The MDBA commissioned its own analysis of the issue and concluded the loss of return flows was reducing water in the rivers by 121 billion litres a year.

They say that review shows the reduction in return flows is not a significant factor and does not impact the outcomes of the basin plan.

""The most comprehensive analysis suggests it is an issue, but not a huge one,"" said Professor Vertessy.

Clue Four: Climate change

There is one issue, however, that most experts do agree is a major reason for the missing water in the basin.

""The MDBA considers a changing climate to be the primary contributory factor,"" said the MDBA's Vicki Woodburn.

Since the basin plan was introduced, heat records across the area have been broken in four of the eight years. The last three years have been the hottest ever recorded in the basin.

According to the South Australian royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan, the MDBA ""completely ignored climate change"" when determining how much water needed to be saved.

If true, that means the overall target may have been set too low — that more water needs to be recovered from irrigation to save the river system.

But the same models used to set those targets have also been used to manage the rivers, and now to calculate how much water should be in the rivers. And by inadequately accounting for climate change, those models are likely over-predicting how much water is being recovered.

Climate change means more water is likely being lost between gauges, as it flows along — lost into the dry river beds and the hot air.

""The river models that project where the water will be in the rivers haven't accounted for things like greater evaporation of water,"" said Professor Pittock.

Professor Vertessy said most people were surprised by the magnitude and speed of the changes seen across the basin.

""I think a very important thing to appreciate is that we're in a very different hydro-climatic sequence than we ever would have envisaged at the time of the architecting of the basin plan,"" he said.

Clue five: The water was never there

In a twist worthy of any whodunnit, could it be that some of the missing water was simply never there in the first place?

According to the Wentworth Group, the government modelling used to predict how much water we should see in the river has some fundamental flaws which likely exaggerate the volumes.

For example, in 2018, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority found its modelling ""has trouble predicting low flows"".

That meant that when water stopped flowing in the river, the model would still show water flowing — something that could have been particularly problematic over the past seven years when low flows were very common.

If true, it likely means much more water needs to be recovered to save the system to get the same outcomes.

The Wentworth Group scientists say they are confident they applied the modelling as best as was possible, and Rob Vertessy, who advises the MDBA on science, agrees.

""Given their intent, which is to make a comparison of expected flows and those which were realised, then, yes, I think it's as solid as any approach you could adopt,"" he said.

But the MDBA has some reservations. ""While the Wentworth Group has partially accounted for the climate and as-yet-unfinished basin plan implementation, both effects are still present in the analysis and inflate the outcome,"" said Vicki Woodburn.

Everyone seems to be on the same page about how much better the modelling needs to be.

""The MDBA is working to achieve this improved modelling, however it requires further investment and would be done in collaboration with all basin governments,"" said Ms Woodburn.

""This type of analysis should be a fairly routine thing, but in effect, it's a significant research project,"" said Professor Vertessy.

But Wentworth Group scientists are scathing of the lack of adequate modelling and monitoring of flows.

""You can't manage properly what you're not measuring. And it's concerning that the governments haven't been measuring the … real water in the rivers against their flow targets,"" said Professor Pittock.

What it all means

If there's less water in the rivers than we ever planned for, what's to be done about it?

Irrigators say the response should not be to buy more water from farmers, as that would cost too many jobs.

""If we think about changes to [sustainable diversion limits], then we also have to then think about what impact it has on those things as well,"" said Steve Whan from the National Irrigators' Council.

Mr Whan wants environmental targets to focus more on ""complementary measures"" — measures of environmental health, rather than volumes of water.

The MDBA itself says we need to wait until more of the basin plan is enacted before we think about changing the recovery targets, or ""sustainable diversion limits"" (SDLs) — which are set for review in 2026.

""The basin plan is still not fully implemented so it is too early to suggest the SDLs need to change,"" says Vicki Woodburn.

But Professor Vertessy, who advises the MDBA, thinks this sort of shortfall could contribute to a rethink of the long-term water recovery targets.

""We may have to — I think everyone would accept that these sustainable diversion limits aren't quantities which you ossify for posterity,"" he says.

""They've got to be adjusted to fit in with the new climate realities and the social preferences of the day.""

And the scientists say whatever the response to the findings, something has to give.

""The current basin plan tries to pretend that we can do everything with a smaller and smaller cake,"" says Professor Pittock.

""What this really means is that society is going to have to make some hard choices. How much irrigated agriculture do we want as a society versus how much do we want to retain by way of wetlands and ecosystems [or] of sites of cultural value to Indigenous people?""

January 2020 warmest on record: EU climate service,https://phys.org/news/2020-02-january-warmest-eu-climate.html,"Temperatures were likewise higher than normal in New South Wales in Australia, where massive bushfires devastated large areas of the state

Last month was the warmest January on record globally, while in Europe temperatures were a balmy three degrees Celsius above the average January from 1981 to 2010, the European Union's climate monitoring system reported Tuesday.

Across a band of countries stretching from Norway to Russia, temperatures were an unprecedented 6C above the same 30-year benchmark, Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reported in a statement.

New temperature highs—monthly, yearly, decadal—have become commonplace due to the impact of climate change, caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels, scientists say.

The five last years have been the hottest on record, as was the ten-year period 2010-2019.

2019—the second warmest year—was only 0.04C below 2016, when temperatures were boosted by a powerful El Nino, a periodic natural weather phenomenon over the Pacific Ocean.

The global record last month was 0.03C above the preceding warmest January, also in 2016.

For Europe, last month was ""about 0.2C warmer than the previous warmest January in 2007, and 3.1C warmer than the average January in the period 1981-2010,"" C3S reported.

Records also tumbled in specific locations across the northern reaches of the continent.

The village of Sunndalsora in western Norway, for example, hit 19C (66 Fahrenheit) on January 2, more than 25C above the monthly average, while the Swedish town of Orebro saw its warmest January day on the 9th since records began in 1858.

Cross-country ski tracks were closed across large swathes of Norway and Sweden.

Exceptional above-average temperatures extended over nearly all of Russia as well, and they were higher than normal over much of the United States, eastern Canada, Japan and parts of eastern China.

Temperatures were likewise higher than normal in New South Wales in Australia, where massive bushfires devastated large areas of the state.

Atmospheric concentrations of CO2—which causes global warming—are now at their highest level in at least 800,000 years.

The United Nations said last year that manmade greenhouse gas emissions needed to tumble 7.6 percent annually over the next decade to cap global warming at 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the aspirational goal set in the landmark Paris Agreement.

Current pledges to cut emissions put Earth on a path of several degrees warming by the end of the century.

"Russia Halts Wheat Exports, Deepening Fears of Food Shortage",https://time.com/5827804/russia-wheat-food-shortage/,"For the first time in a decade, the world risks being cut off from Russian wheat at a time when some key buyers are rushing to import it.

The top shipper last month limited sales through June to protect its own supply as the coronavirus crisis sparks food-security concerns around the world. Although the curbs were seen loose enough to ensure normal trade flows for this time of year, Russia has already burned through the entire quota. It will halt grain shipments to all but four former Soviet neighbors once the last cargo booked under the limits leaves the country.

While the ban will only last until farmers start harvesting in July, some other nearby nations have also restricted grain exports, threatening to reroute global trade and fueling worries about food shortages and higher prices. Countries from Egypt to Turkey are trying to load up on imports while they still can, and Russian shippers have been feeding that demand.

There has been “a flurry of activity” recently, said Andrey Sizov Jr., managing director at consultant SovEcon in Moscow. “Buyers want to stock up because they realize they may not have the chance to do it later.”

The window has closed fast. In just a few weeks, shippers booked out all of the 7 million-ton quota set through June. As well as strong demand from importers, a weak ruble is keeping Russian grain attractive. Also, sales from government stockpiles — another measure intended to safeguard domestic supplies — have helped contain local prices and keep exports competitive.

The Agriculture Ministry on Sunday didn’t specify when the last cargo booked under the quota could leave.

One reason the limit was reached so quickly was because shippers rushed to get customs paperwork for future cargoes, according to Dmitry Rylko, director general at the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies. That means about 3 million tons could still be exported in the next two months, Reuters reported him as saying.

Russia has a history of disrupting the wheat market through restrictions or taxes, but last imposed an outright ban in 2010 after drought destroyed crops. The move caused wheat futures to rally and some researchers saw it as as an indirect contributor to the Arab Spring uprisings.

While there’s still ample global supplies, the memories of past food shortages have restarted the debate about food nationalism. Organizations such as the United Nations and European Union said the risk of social and political unrest is rising again as the pandemic spurs discontent, and urged against unjustified measures that could hurt food security and raise prices.

Trade Shift

Banning Russian exports could benefit rival suppliers such as the EU and the U.S., said Amy Reynolds, a senior economist at the International Grains Council in London. Crops office FranceAgriMer this month raised its outlook for French wheat exports outside the bloc to a record for the season that ends in June.

Egypt is one country that may purchase more from the EU. The top wheat buyer is taking an unusual step of importing a large amount of wheat during its own harvest to ensure it has enough to feed its population, many of whom live in poverty. The North African nation is heavily reliant on Black Sea grain, but has already boosted French purchases this season due to more competitive prices.

The increased demand is drawing down European inventories at a time when dryness is threatening crops across the region. If conditions in the Black Sea deteriorate further, that could prompt buyers around the world to stock up on supplies even more in the coming weeks, SovEcon said.

“The probability of that scenario is growing, given the current weather,” SovEcon’s Sizov said. “Among the major exporters, the U.S. has some of the biggest inventories, and that may help their sales.”

Still, forecasting trade flows remains difficult due to the uncertainty over how the health crisis will play out. Plus, the collapse in the energy market will likely take its toll on the economies of wheat importers like Algeria and Nigeria, which derive large amounts of income from oil.

“The demand profile is uncertain and clouded further by events in the crude oil sector, with some of the key buyers potentially affected by falling oil revenues,” the IGC’s Reynolds said.

The Keystone Oil Spill No One is Talking About Will Be Nearly Impossible to Clean Up,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kejqe/the-keystone-oil-spill-no-ones-talking-about-will-be-nearly-impossible-to-clean-up,"Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.

When the Keystone Pipeline burst last week, half of an Olympic-sized swimming pool’s worth of a particularly dirty fossil fuel spilled into wetlands in North Dakota. And the thick liquid, known as tar sands oil, will be nearly impossible to clean up.

The spill validated some of the worst fears surrounding the pipeline project, which started pumping oil back in 2010, despite opposition from farmers, indigenous groups, and environmental organizations. The Keystone Pipeline carries oil from the enormous tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, across more than 2,000 miles of pristine wetlands in the Dakotas, through Nebraska to Patoka, Illinois.

The company, TC Energy, formerly TransCanada, projected that the pipeline would spill just 11 times over the course of 50 years, or about once every seven years. Since it started pumping, it’s already spilled large amounts of oil four times.

”I would tell you that’s the worst-case scenario.”

Tar sands oil is a mixture of clay, water, and a thick, heavy oil called bitumen, the sticky stuff that binds asphalt together. The oil gets dissolved in a cocktail of chemicals, called diluent, to allow it to flow through a pipeline. (Imagine trying to suck peanut butter through a straw; that’s what pumping bitumen through a pipeline would be like without diluent.) Together, the combo of bitumen and diluent is called “dilbit.”

TC Energy estimates that 383,000 gallons of the particularly sludgy tar sands oil spilled out of their pipeline on Oct. 29, near Edinburg, North Dakota, a rural town with a population of less than 200 on the edge of farmland and prairies.

When tar sands oil spills, the diluent evaporates pretty quickly — causing toxic, short-term air pollution — and leaves the heavy bitumen behind, which sinks.

“Once bitumen sinks to the bottom of a lake or wetland, it is much more problematic to clean up than conventional oil, which floats nicely and can be skimmed off the surface,” Diane Orihel, a professor in aquatic ecotoxicology at Queen’s University, told VICE News.

The wetlands in the Dakotas, fertile breeding grounds for migratory birds like Canada geese and the American bittern, have already been widely drained out for agriculture. They once covered about 10% of the state; half were wiped out over the course of the 20th century to create more farmland. Only about 2.7 million acres of wetlands remain.

When tar-sands oil leaches into wetlands, they’re just about impossible to restore entirely.

“Wetlands are a fragile environment, the most sensitive,” said Michel Boufadel, a professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of New Jersey Institute of Technology. “On the other extreme is rocks.”

“So if you told me there’s an oil spill in wetlands, I would tell you that’s the worst-case scenario,” added Boufadel, who worked with the EPA on the cleanup of a previous tar-sands oil spill in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Cleaning up the wetlands could involved digging them up to get at the bitumen that’s sunk in. But that risks damaging the wetland in the process of trying to save it.

“One of the larger ones”

These kinds of pipelines are built to spill. But just how big the spills are can be tricky to estimate, and the company has a vested interest in not alarming the surrounding community.

Of the four times Keystone has spilled large amounts of oil, the most recent incident is currently estimated to be the second-biggest. And with each of the prior spills, initial estimates drastically lowballed the amount.

“This one would be one of the larger ones in volume that we've had in my time,” said Karl Rockeman, the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality’s division of water quality.

Two years ago, when the Keystone Pipeline burst in South Dakota, the company initially said that 210,000 gallons of oil had spilled. It turns out that TC Energy dumped twice as much oil into the serene South Dakota landscape.

Rockeman doesn’t expect any major adjustments to the estimates of how much oil spilled this time. The company, he said, has provided an adequate justification for their current figures, which are already high. That doesn’t mean the estimates won’t be revised, though.

“It's important to remember that as new data becomes available, and as a spill progresses, those numbers can change,” he said. “I think as we go forward, we might see some adjustments to that volume, but not a large change.”

As of Tuesday, TC Energy said it had recovered about 4,300 barrels worth of oil, or more than 180,00 gallons — more than half of what the company said it had spilled. “There have been no reported injuries or impacted wildlife,” the company said.

Eating through a pipeline

At the mines in Alberta, the oily tar sands get shoveled out of huge, open-air pits, carted to a plant, and dropped into a big cone-shaped vessel. There, using huge amounts of hot water, the bitumen is separated from the sand and clay.

Extracting, refining, and burning this type of oil sends more carbon emissions into the atmosphere than crude oil. One barrel’s worth of tar sands oil produces about 20% more greenhouse gas emissions than a barrel of conventional oil.

Once refined through that energy-intensive process, the oil makes its way into a pipeline.

Tar sands oil is also more corrosive than traditional crude oil, in part because, its thickness requires staying hot and diluted with a chemical cocktail to allow it to flow through the pipeline. If water gets into the mix, the oil becomes especially corrosive, according to Boufadel.

That increases the likelihood that tar sands oil will eat its way through a pipeline’s steel. A study found that pipelines carrying tar sands oil through the Midwest burst three times as often as those carrying conventional oil, according to the National Resources Defense Council.

TC Energy hasn’t said what caused this particular spill — but the last big one in 2017 was the result of damage done to the pipeline during its construction, according to a federal investigation.

For now, no one but regulators and the company have been allowed to inspect the site of the spill. Activists and environmentalists are predictably concerned that the spill is way bigger.

Joye Braun, the first camper at Standing Rock, a protest organized to oppose an extension of the Keystone Pipeline, said she felt she’d be risking arrest if she attempted to get close to it.

“What we know is that these spills tend to be dramatically worse than initial estimates,” Collentine said. “And even if we already have the information for the true amount that’s spilled, the impacts are serious.”

For Native Americans in the Dakotas like Braun, these spills are deeply personal.

“This is our homeland, this is our DNA –has been here for millennia,” Braun said. “Long after the United States and North Dakota is long gone, we’re still going to be here. And we’re going to have to clean this up.”

CORRECTION 11/8 10:31 a.m.: A previous version of this story mistakenly said that bitumen binds cement together. The story has been corrected to say asphalt. The story has also been updated to clarify the number of gallons of oil TC Energy has cleaned up."
"US Suicide Rates Hit Record-High Levels, CDC Says",https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/914666,"Suicide rates in the United States have risen significantly over the past 2 decades and are now at the highest level since World War II, federal health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today.

New data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) show the age-adjusted suicide rate was 33% higher in 2017 than in 1999 — 14.0 per 100,000 standard population vs 10.5 per 100,000.

The data in an article published online June 20 in Health E-Stats provide supplemental information on suicide rates by sex, age, and race/ethnicity.

""Information about the groups at highest risk for suicide can help inform prevention efforts,"" first author Sally Curtin, MA, from the Division of Vital Statistics, NCHS, told Medscape Medical News.

""The key findings are that for both males and females, age-adjusted suicide rates increased significantly between 1999 and 2017 for all race and ethnicity groups except non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders,"" said Curtin.

In 2017, among males and females of all ages, suicide rates were highest for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives compared to other race/ethnicity groups, Curtin said.

A ""National Tragedy""

The data show a 139% increase in suicides among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native women from 1999 to 2017 (from 4.6 to 11.0 per 100,000) and a 71% increase among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native men (19.8 to 33.8 per 100,000).

For both non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native males and females, rates of suicide are highest among people aged 15 to 24 years and 25 to 44 years. Among the 45- to 64-year-old age group, the rate was highest among white people for both men and women.

Data for the analysis are from the National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files for 1999 and 2017.

The results are in line with a report published earlier this month in JAMA that showed a significant uptick in suicides among 15- to 24-year-olds between 2000 and 2017.

Similarly, a report published last week showed a troubling increase in deaths by suicide and drug overdose among persons aged 18 to 34.

As reported by Medscape Medical News, between 2007 and 2017, this age group saw a 108% increase in drug-related deaths, a 69% increase in alcohol-related deaths, and a 35% increase in deaths by suicide.

""The huge increase in the numbers of millennials being lost to substance misuse and suicide is a national tragedy,"" John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America's Health, said in a press release.

"Surprise, Big Oil Has the Same Lawyers as Big Tobacco",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qj4yxv/fossil-fuel-industry-opposing-climate-change-lawsuits-defended-big-tobacco,"Earlier this year, three New Jersey senators urged the state to sue the fossil fuel industry for lying about the climate emergency. A resolution they introduced, which is now winding its way through the legislative process, alleges that fossil fuel companies “downplayed the risks of climate change” while selling products it knew would cause devastating sea-level rise and disasters like Hurricane Sandy.

“Big Oil took a page out of Big Tobacco’s playbook and funded and led a decades-long campaign to lie, deceive, and confuse the public about the science of climate change,” they argued in an op-ed this summer.

Oil companies are doing more than just borrow strategy from cigarette companies, however. With legal efforts like New Jersey’s on the rise across the U.S., Big Oil appears to be outsourcing its defense to organizations that actually wrote the tobacco playbook.

“Selling lawful energy necessary to modern society is not a liability-causing event,” lawyer Phil Goldberg wrote to the New Jersey senate earlier this month, on behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers. “It is neither fair nor productive to scapegoat an industry.”

The National Association of Manufacturers is an industrial trade group that represents more than 14,000 companies, including fossil fuel producers Exxon, Shell, and Arch Coal. The association’s membership also includes Philip Morris. In internal documents, the tobacco giant once described the National Association of Manufacturers as a “loyal” ally, saying that it had “aggressively courted the media on issues consistent with our interests.”

Goldberg himself, who didn’t respond to a request for comment, is a managing partner at the law firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon. “They were well-known for defending the tobacco industry,” Sharon Eubanks, a former U.S. attorney who helped lead a federal fraud trial against cigarette manufacturers in the early 2000s, told VICE News. That trial resulted in a 2006 ruling stating that the companies “sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.” Eubanks has since advised policymakers on the parallels between tobacco and fossil fuels.

The recent New Jersey resolution states that “14 municipalities across the country and the States of Massachusetts and Rhode Island have filed lawsuits against companies that produce, promote, market, and profit from the sale of fossil fuels.” Over the past month alone, those jurisdictions have been joined by Connecticut, Delaware, and the cities of Hoboken, New Jersey and Charleston, South Carolina.

Goldberg has fired off statements, letters, and op-eds opposing many of these legal challenges, sometimes within hours of them being announced. He recently argued that “filing a bunch of these lawsuits is a political strategy by environmental advocates” that will “do nothing” to solve climate change.

But supporters of climate lawsuits see this a deliberate public relations strategy. “It’s reminiscent of the tobacco liability litigation,” Denise Antolini, an environmental law professor at the University of Hawaii, told VICE News. She said that fossil fuel producers are desperate to prevent public opinion from turning against them, the same way it did against cigarette makers once courts ruled that they had deliberately lied about the dangers of smoking.

If and when these current climate lawsuits start being tried, Big Oil will have to defend itself in court against allegations that it could have prevented immense death and suffering by acting on its early knowledge of climate change, but chose to fund campaigns casting doubt on climate science instead. “The opportunity is there to pivot the mindset of the American public…to get people to realize their consumption choices are bound up in deception,” Antolini said.

Goldberg is special counsel and spokesperson for an organization known as the Manufacturers’ Accountability Project, which since its founding in 2017 has become one of the most vocal opponents of efforts to sue oil, gas, and coal producers. “It is very actively defending the fossil fuels companies against this litigation,” said Karen Savage, a reporter for the media outlet Climate Docket who’s covered the organization.

The Manufacturers’ Accountability Project, which didn’t respond to VICE News’s request for comment, was created by the National Association of Manufacturers.

Back in the 1950s, scientists at Philip Morris, then the world’s largest cigarette maker, observed that “evidence is building up that heavy smoking contributes to lung cancer.” But the company denied that link publicly for decades, and by the 1990s was working closely with the National Association of Manufacturers to ward off a growing number of lawsuits, including collaborating on a “massive outreach and mobilization effort” targeting Democratic lawmakers.

Shook, Hardy & Bacon, the firm that Goldberg has worked at since 2003, was similarly involved. Its lawyers aggressively defended the tobacco industry in court—in one infamous exchange causing a plaintiff dying of lung cancer to well up in tears during cross-examination by questioning if he knew the color of his father’s eyes. “Shook, Hardy & Bacon also assisted the Tobacco Institute (a trade and lobby group for the industry) in setting strategy, preparing witnesses on smoking and health issues, briefings, reviewing press releases, advertisements, and other public statements, and orchestrating follow-up activities,” according to the 2006 ruling from U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler.

She wrote in her opinion that attorneys representing the tobacco companies “played a major role in these efforts to discredit the Surgeon General’s Reports and attack other scientific research linking smoking and disease,” and that this represented “a sad and disquieting chapter in the history of an honorable and often courageous profession.”

Yet a 2008 article in ABA Journal about Shook, Hardy & Bacon noted that “even the firm’s harshest critics admit there’s no evidence any of the firm’s lawyers have ever been charged with professional misconduct.”

Eubanks argues the same tactics used then by Big Tobacco—which included attacking the people suing them rather than responding to the actual substance of a given lawsuit—are now being repeated on behalf of Big Oil. “They want you to say ‘look at what the trial lawyers are doing’ instead of reading what the allegations are,” she said.

An internal tobacco document from the late 1990s for example urged cigarette companies and their allies to question the ethics of “trial lawyers,” argued that cancer litigation could be a “slippery slope” for U.S. businesses, and warned of a “massive increase in government involvement in the private sector.”

The Manufacturers’ Accountability Project, by comparison, currently describes climate litigation as a “concerted, coordinated campaign being waged by plaintiffs’ lawyers, public officials, deep-pocketed foundations, and other activists who have sought to undermine and weaken manufacturers in the United States.”

“It’s gaslighting,” Eubanks argued, intended to deflect attention away from the long and well-documented history of oil companies lying about the dangers of climate change. “You look away from what’s there right in front you.”

These messages are not necessarily pitched towards lawyers, judges, or others involved in the actual legal proceedings of a trial. They’re intended to influence public opinion, Eubanks said.

“Courts and legal commentators are increasingly recognizing that the media, through the way it covers litigation, can have a tremendous impact on how individual lawsuits are resolved,” Goldberg wrote in 2005 for the Young Lawyers Committee. He described himself as someone who takes media battles just as seriously as those that happen in the courtroom, a lawyer who “specializes in applying the ‘Iron Triangle’—legislative, media, and broad-based litigation solutions—to help clients solve complex corporate litigation problems.”

References to “The Iron Triangle Defense” appeared in a 2016 PowerPoint presentation Goldberg gave in Nashville, Tennessee, during which he urged companies facing negative litigation or regulations to “develop allies, write articles, work with media.”

Antolini appeared to be on the receiving end of the “Iron Triangle” three years later when she organized a conference on climate change litigation in Honolulu. The day before the conference, which brought together academics, policymakers, and climate activists, Antolini received an email from Goldberg asking her to “postpone” portions of the event “until you can include panelists who can represent each side of this issue.”

“It’s just ridiculous,” she said, explaining this was the only such request she’d received in her more than two decades as a law professor.

A week or so later, Goldberg got a letter to the editor about the conference published in the Honolulu Star Advertiser. “I expect activists to believe their propaganda, but not well-respected law school faculty. Denise Antolini could not be more wrong in saying that suing energy manufacturers over global climate change was somehow ‘tried-and-true,’” he wrote.

Antolini decided to respond directly to Goldberg. “Your request to disrupt our public event was quite surprising, especially coming from far across the continent, from someone I’ve never heard of, on behalf of a private client with an apparently direct financial interest in chilling debate about climate litigation, with no apparent connection to Hawai’i, and with, it seems no understanding of the climate crisis we are facing in the island and the Pacific,” she wrote in a letter addressed to his office at Shook, Hardy & Bacon.

She never received a reply."
"A new analysis finds just 9 counties, mostly in California, are the key for the entire US food distribution structure.",https://www.fastcompany.com/90422553/the-first-map-of-americas-food-supply-chain-is-mind-boggling,"My team at the University of Illinois just developed the first high-resolution map of the U.S. food supply chain.

Our map is a comprehensive snapshot of all food flows between counties in the U.S.—grains, fruits and vegetables, animal feed, and processed food items. To build the map, we brought together information from eight databases, including the Freight Analysis Framework from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which tracks where items are shipped around the country, and Port Trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which shows the international ports through which goods are traded. We also released this information in a publicly available database. What does this map reveal? 1. Where your food comes from Now, residents in each county can see how they are connected to all other counties in the country via food transfers. Overall, there are 9.5 million links between counties on our map. All Americans, from urban to rural are connected through the food system. Consumers all rely on distant producers, agricultural processing plants, food storage like grain silos and grocery stores, and food transportation systems.

For example, the map shows how a shipment of corn starts at a farm in Illinois, travels to a grain elevator in Iowa before heading to a feedlot in Kansas, and then travels in animal products being sent to grocery stores in Chicago. 2. Where the food hubs are At 22 million tons of food, Los Angeles County received more food than any other county in 2012, our study year. It also shipped out the most of any county: almost 17 million tons. California’s Fresno County and Stanislaus County are the next largest, respectively. In fact, many of the counties that shipped and received the most food were located in California. This is due to the several large urban centers, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as the productive Central Valley in California. We also looked for the core counties—the places that are most central to the overall structure of the food supply network. A disruption to any of these counties may have ripple effects for the food supply chain of the entire country. We did this by looking for counties with the largest number of connections to others, as well as those that score highly in a factor called “betweenness centrality,” a measurement of the places with the largest fraction of the shortest paths.

San Bernardino County led the list, followed again by a number of other California transit hubs. Also on the list are Maricopa County, Arizona; Shelby County, Tennessee; and Harris County, Texas. However, our estimates are for 2012, an extreme drought year in the Cornbelt. So, in another year, the network may look different. It’s possible that counties within the Cornbelt would show up as more critical in non-drought years. This is something that we hope to dig into in future work. 3. How food travels from place to place We also looked at how much food is transported between one county and another. Many of the largest food transport links were within California. This indicates that there is a lot of internal food movement within the state. One of the largest links is from Niagara County to Erie County in New York. That’s due to the flow of food through an important international overland port with Canada.

advertisement

Some of the other largest links were inside the counties themselves. This is because of moving food items around for manufacturing within a county—for example, milk gets off a truck at a large depot and is then shipped to a yogurt facility, then the yogurt is moved to a grocery distribution warehouse, all within the same county. The food supply chain relies on a complex web of interconnected infrastructure. For example, a lot of grain produced throughout the Midwest is transported to the Port of New Orleans for export. This primarily occurs via the waterways of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The infrastructure along these waterways—such as locks 52 and 53—are critical, but have not been overhauled since their construction in 1929. They represent a serious bottleneck, slowing down innumerable supply chains nationwide, including that of grain. If they were to fail entirely, then commodity transport and supply chains would be completely disrupted. Railroads are also important for moving grain. Fresh produce, on the other hand, is often moved around the country by refrigerated truck. This is due to the need to keep fresh fruits and vegetables—relatively high value agricultural products—cool until they reach the consumer. In future work, we hope to evaluate the specific infrastructure that is critical to the U.S. food supply chain.

Arizona Public Service cut Stephanie Pullman's power because she owed $51. It was 105+ degrees outside. The heat killed her.,https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/aps-cut-power-heat-customer-dead-phoenix-summer-shutoff-11310515,"If Arizona Public Service hadn't cut off her electricity last September, Stephanie Pullman might still be alive today.

On August 23, 2018, the utility mailed a warning letter to the 72-year-old’s home in Sun City West, where she lived with her cat, Cocoa. Pullman owed APS $176.84, it said. She had five days to pay in full. Otherwise, APS would disconnect the electricity. Outside, temperatures were in the triple digits.

Pullman lived on less than $1,000 a month in Social Security, according to one of her daughters, Jeanine Smith. Her children regularly chipped in to help with expenses. When their mother’s air conditioner broke in April 2018, they made sure it was fixed. Smith, who lives in Ohio, paid her mother’s phone bill; her sister, Chris Hotes, covered the internet.

APS didn’t cut off Pullman’s electricity on August 28. Pullman’s final electric bills show that on September 5, 2018, the day after her Social Security check normally arrived, she paid APS $125.

It wasn’t enough. Two days later, on September 7, APS disconnected her electricity. That day, temperatures hit at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit, instruments recorded in nearby Youngtown showed. Smith recalled it was 107 degrees.

One week later, alarmed that she and her sister hadn’t heard from their mother, Hotes called the Sun City West Posse, a local group that conducts wellness checks. The posse alerted people at the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, who entered the house to find Pullman in her bed.

The house had no air conditioning, because it had no electricity. Pullman's body was already decomposing, the coroner’s report said. The medical examiner wrote that her death occurred by ""environmental heat exposure in setting of significant cardiovascular disease.""

People from the sheriff's office noticed signs of a cat, but Cocoa was nowhere to be found.

Smith said she believed her mother did not know that her electricity was about to be disconnected. If Pullman had known, she would have asked for help paying the bill, and her children would have freely given it, Smith said.

“We would’ve never let her power go out,” said Smith. “Never.”

The cost of cooling



Dr. Vjollca Berisha, senior epidemiologist with the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, calls heat “a silent killer.”

“You never know when it’s going to strike you,” she said. “You never know how much you can take.”

Heat is not destructive in the dramatic manner of a tornado or an earthquake. Nor is its damage as visible or as stunning. If an elderly person’s air conditioning breaks in the middle of July, who, from the outside, can tell?

The danger of heat is also the kind of complex problem that, by virtue of being everybody’s responsibility, somehow becomes no one’s responsibility.

“What can we do as a society?” Berisha mused. “As a society, we have to get organized.”

Community-based groups need to figure out how to target and reach people who need help, she said. “I know a lot of people are working on it, but they are working in silos,” Berisha added.

Dr. Vjolla Berisha Elizabeth Whitman

In 2015, the Department of Public Health took the lead on a coalition called Bridging Climate Change and Public Health, a collection of 28 different groups aimed at addressing climate-related health risks, including heat. So far, it has produced a strategic plan. Its long-term impact remains to be seen.

The group has no funding, Berisha said. “We are just operating based on goodwill and people who are really ready to donate their time,” she said.

Since the county began tracking heat-related deaths in 2006, the data, spread out annually, resemble a roller coaster that arches a little higher with each successive hill. In the last three years, the number of people in Maricopa County who died because of heat has exploded. In 2016, 154 died from heat-related causes. In 2017, that rose to 179.

Last year, 182 people died, in some way or another, because of the heat. Of those, 119 deaths were caused directly by the heat. In the remaining 63, heat was a contributing factor.

But whether heat is the direct cause or not, the data also shows that socioeconomic factors are equally powerful predictors of death by heat. People who are older, poorer, or isolated are at the greatest risk, county data shows.

In 2018, 35 percent of heat-related deaths were among homeless people. Heat-related deaths among Native Americans (4 out of every 100,000 people) is twice the rate of such deaths among whites (1.8 out of 100,000); the rate among African-Americans is also extremely high, at 2.8 people per 100,000. Both of these communities have higher rates of poverty than others, Berisha noted.

In Maricopa County, temperatures usually start to eclipse 100 degrees Fahrenheit in mid-May, maintaining that oven-like feel sometimes well into October. A typical summer will see 26 days with temperatures pushing past 110 degrees.

Heat-related deaths in the county are on the rise. Maricopa County Public Health

With climate change and urbanization, the heat in Maricopa County is worsening. State data shows that in the Phoenix area, average minimum nighttime temperatures rose by approximately 9 degrees from 1948 to 2000, with average daytime temperatures rising by about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit.

As the county began analyzing the data it collected, something surprising came up. About 40 percent of the heat-related deaths were happening indoors.

“Initially, we thought whatever [death] is heat-related is associated with the outdoors,” Berisha said.

As they parsed medical examiner reports, death certificates, and hospital discharge and other public health statistics, they found that of the deaths indoors, 80 percent were because a person’s house, apartment, or condo was too hot, because air conditioning did not exist, or because it didn't work. In the remaining 20 percent, the air conditioning status was unknown.

In 12 percent of the cases with nonfunctional air conditioning, homes simply had no air conditioning, Berisha said, sitting at her desk and scrolling through the slides of a recent presentation she had given on heat-related deaths. Behind her was a bulletin board, tacked with printouts of graphs and charts on Maricopa County’s silent killer.

In the remaining 88 percent of cases, the air conditioning wasn’t functioning. The causes: no electricity (11 percent), AC turned off (28 percent), or broken AC (61 percent). Overall, 83 percent of indoor heat-related deaths happened in a home where the air-conditioning wasn't running.

Crunch the numbers, and a broken air conditioner, perhaps left unrepaired due to a lack of money, is a factor in 17 percent of all heat-related deaths. A shuttered air conditioner, perhaps turned off in an attempt to save money, is responsible for 7.8 percent. And a lack of electricity, perhaps because a utility disconnected a person over an unpaid bill, unpaid for lack of money, caused 3 percent of the total heat-related deaths.

After record heat-related deaths were seen in 2016, a group of local researchers, including Berisha and scientists at Arizona State University, analyzed a decade’s worth of data, trying to figure out why deaths had spiked. They discovered that high temperatures could not explain the surge.

“Our results indicate that factors other than the weather were predominantly responsible for the surge in heat-associated deaths in 2016,” they wrote. They couldn’t explain those factors but instead called for “further clarification of the complex iterations between the many social and physical determinants of risk of heat-related illness and death.”

They published their results in a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters, on September 19, 2018, five days after Stephanie Pullman was found in her bed.

“It seems like more and more people are not able to afford to keep the air conditioning on,” Berisha said. Utility companies need to cut people a break, especially during peak summer months, she said.

People like Pullman.

‘You ended my mom’s life for $51’



Stephanie Pullman moved to Arizona from Ohio in 1988, after her four children had graduated high school. She followed her best friend from high school out west, in part to escape the harsh Midwestern winters.

“We tried to get her to come home,” Smith said. “She loved Arizona. She loved the weather.”

In Arizona, Pullman continued working for a hospital in the dietary department, as she had when she was raising her kids in Ohio as a single mom. She loved Cocoa, the cat, and she adored her grandchildren, Smith said.

Pullman also loved to garden and kept flowers all around her two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot house in Sun City West, Smith said. Bougainvillea grew in front, and she decorated outside her house with rocks, wind chimes, and figurines of the Native American deity Kokopelli.

One of Pullman’s favorite pastimes was visiting garage and yard sales. “We used to speed up whenever we saw one, so we didn’t have to stop,” Smith remembered with a chuckle.

Pullman retired in 2011, a month after she turned 65, switching to a fixed income. The Social Security check that arrived on the fourth of every month was less than $1,000, and her electric bill consumed a startling amount of that, according to Smith.

In the summer, “her utility bill would be pushing $200,” Smith said. Everything in the house ran on electricity, she added. “That’s what hurt her.”

Although her mother was “very independent, she asked for help when she needed it,” Smith said.

The last time Smith heard from her mother was on September 5, 2018. In an email, Pullman thanked her daughter for paying for repairs to her phone. It said, “The phone is fixed, thank you very much, love you, bye,” Smith recalled.

Her sister, Chris Hotes, had spoken to their mother by phone a day earlier. Pullman asked for help paying a water bill, and Hotes said she’d send money. She called her mother again on September 7 and left her a message telling her to keep an eye out for money in the mail.

She never heard back.

The exact date Pullman died is unclear from the medical examiner’s report. Smith said their family never received a specific date of death.

From what she and Hotes could piece together from the respective bills they paid for their mother, it was sometime between September 7 and September 14. Pullman last used her phone and internet on September 7. A week later, the Sun City West posse called the sheriff's office to enter her home.

A medical examiner determined that Pullman died of cardiovascular disease, with heat and diabetes acting as “significant contributing factors,” according to the coroner’s report. It noted, too that APS had cut off electricity on September 7. It did not include the exact temperature in the house but mentioned that Pullman was found ""in [an] uncooled residence during period of markedly elevated environmental temperatures.""

Twelve days after the sheriff’s office discovered Pullman, Cocoa turned up. She had been hiding under the bed.

Smith took the cat home with her to Ohio. She started going through her mother’s paperwork, trying to find out what had happened, when she noticed the disconnection notice from APS. It was the only notification Smith found.

APS sent one shutoff warning to Stephanie Pullman, dated August 23, 2018. It gave her five days to pay her bill or lose power to her home. Courtesy of Jeanine Smith

“Dear STEPHANIE PULLMAN,” the letter read. “We value your business and are committed to keeping you informed about the status of your account.”

“Our records indicate your payment has not been received. Because of the delinquent status of your account, your service is scheduled for disconnection on August 28, 2018. You can avoid paying disconnection by paying $176.84 prior to that date,” it said.

If APS did end up disconnecting her electricity, and Pullman wanted to reconnect it, she would have to pay up to $135 in reconnect charges, the letter said. She'd also owe tax, perhaps a deposit, and all of her delinquent charges. That bill also tacked on new electricity charges totaling $155.90, for a total of $335.57 owed to APS.

It’s not clear why APS did not cut off Pullman’s service on August 28, as threatened, and instead terminated her service 10 days later.

Smith said that on September 5, Pullman paid $125 of the $176.84 APS demanded in order to avoid shutoff, leaving $51.84 unpaid. The $125 payment shows up, without a date, on Pullman’s final APS bill, dated September 14.

The final bill said Pullman still owed APS $287.86. That amount was a combination of her remaining balance and additional electricity charges, plus a $10.65 “field call charge” from September 5.

A field call charge is what APS charges customers in the process of turning off their electricity, according to a schedule filed by APS with the Arizona Corporation Commission in September 2017 and company terms and conditions.

It is incurred “when an authorized Company representative travels to the Customer's site to accept payment on a delinquent account, notify of service termination, make payment arrangements, or terminate the service,” the schedule explains.

Smith said she called the Arizona Corporation Commission, which called APS and told the utility to call Smith. “They did verify that Mom was $51 short, and that’s why they had shut it off,” she said.

“I told APS, ‘You ended my mom’s life for $51,’” Smith said. The person on the other end, who failed to comprehend that Smith’s mother was no longer alive, replied that if she was ever having trouble paying her bill, she could call and notify them, Smith said.

In October, she left a heart-wrenching review for APS on the website Consumer Affairs. She gave the utility one star; zero stars is not an option.

“It’s not like she didn’t pay anything,” Smith said. “She paid $125. She still had to eat. She still had to buy toilet paper. She had to pay her mortgage.”

“The details just made me ill,” Smith said.

No protections



The Arizona Administrative Code lays out when a utility can or cannot shut off service to a customer, but those rules offer few actual protections for people like Stephanie Pullman.

If a residential customer cannot pay a bill, a utility can’t cut off service if the customer can provide medical documents showing that “termination would be especially dangerous” to their health, the code says. The utility also can’t cut off service “where weather will be especially dangerous to health as defined or as determined by the [Corporation] Commission.”

How the Corporation Commission defines these vague circumstances — weather that “will be especially dangerous to health” — is unclear. The code doesn’t contain specific temperatures or dates.

The code also states that utilities can’t shut off residential service to “ill, elderly, or handicapped persons” who can’t pay their bills unless the customer “has been informed of the availability of funds from various government and social assistance agencies of which the utility is aware.”

From that carefully couched phrase, it’s not clear who is responsible for informing a customer “of the availability of funds.” Nor does the code provide clear definitions of “ill, elderly, or handicapped.”

At 72, Stephanie Pullman might have qualified as elderly. She also had heart disease and Type II diabetes, which might have qualified her as “ill.” But the only information APS sent her about paying her bill was a warning that she was about to be cut off.

A spokesperson for the Corporation Commission did not respond by deadline to Phoenix New Times' questions about how the Arizona Administrative Code is enforced and whether utilities ever face consequences of any kind for failing to follow the rules, however little protection they provide to real people.

Of the two major power providers in Maricopa County, the Corporation Commission regulates — and state code applies to — only one: APS. The other, Salt River Project, is a quasi-municipality and thus considered a political subdivision of the state.

Asked to provide a written policy of when it will or will not cut off a person's electricity, APS cited rules from the Arizona Administrative Code, including those described above. Jill Hanks, a spokesperson for the company, also said in an email, ""APS does not disconnect service for non-payment on extreme heat days as determined by weather experts.""

""We use multiple third-party weather services, including the National Weather Service, to alert us when weather conditions may be dangerous to a person's health,"" Hanks added. The conditions she provided as examples included temperature and consecutive days of heat, but they did not include specific figures or temperatures.

The National Weather Service issues excessive heat warnings, a regionally tailored advisory when heat is forecast to exceed local norms. The criteria vary considerably from place to place. In Maricopa County, the National Weather Service will issue an excessive heat warning when temperatures are predicted to eclipse 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

Which means that if the forecast says a high of 109, and a person's electricity is about to be terminated, there will be no excessive heat warning to — ironically — save them.

APS's terms and conditions on termination loop back to Arizona Administrative Code. ""APS may, without liability for injury or damage, and without making a personal visit to the site, disconnect service to any Customer ... if Company has met the notice requirements established by the Arizona Corporation Commission."" Nowhere in those terms and conditions are any exceptions for extreme weather.

This year, a bill at the Arizona Legislature sought to change that, by creating a law that would cover all utilities and protect people from shutoffs during extreme cold and heat. Its author, Stacey Champion, is a local activist who recently led a consumer complaint lodged at the Corporation Commission over excessive rate hikes by APS in 2017.

""Arizonans currently have no date- or temperature-based protection for utility shutoffs during extreme heat or cold, and this needs to be viewed as the public health crisis it is,"" Champion said. Especially in Maricopa County, air conditioning isn't a luxury, she said. ""It is literally a matter of life or death.""

Senate Bill 1542, sponsored by 15 Democratic state senators and representatives, would have barred utilities in Arizona from disconnecting service when outside temperatures were forecast to fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or exceed 90 degrees. It also stipulated that utilities had to make ""reasonable payment arrangements"" with a customer before cutting service; if the customer didn't honor that arrangement, then the utility could disconnect service only when temperatures were above 32 degrees or below 90, depending on the season.

It also would have unconditionally prohibited utilities from disconnecting service to a person or family if their household income fell below 200 percent of the federal poverty line and they made a minimum payment, or if an elderly person, pregnant person, child under the age of 5, or person on life support lived in the home. The bill also contained other stipulations aimed at protecting people with low incomes from being disconnected.

""Seniors on fixed incomes, folks with disabilities, pregnant women, those suffering from serious medical issues, and households with infants and young children especially need to be protected,"" Champion said. APS is not the only utility that is responsible for these cutoffs, she added.

Every summer, APS and SRP disconnect the electricity of tens of thousands of people living in the Valley of the Sun.

Data from SRP, which Champion obtained through a public records request and shared with New Times, show that from May through September 2018, SRP had 29,474 shutoffs. Records from SRP also showed that last year saw just 19 days when SRP did not disconnect residential customers “due to temperature.”

SRP spokesperson Scott Harelson said that SRP does not disconnect customers on days with excessive heat warnings.

In 2018, APS cut off power to customers more than 110,000 times, representing 79,872 unique accounts, according to the company's own data. Of those, more than 39,000 cutoffs took place during the particularly scorching months of May through September.

In response to questions about Pullman, Jenna Rowell, a spokesperson for APS, said that by law the company could not share anything about her account. She said that APS was required to send, at a minimum, one written shutoff warning to a customer, but that it typically went ""beyond that"" with a phone call and a door hanger. Depending on whether or not they can get through, they'll delay the disconnect date.

Smith said she found only the single written notice from APS, and no door hanger. It's not clear if APS called Pullman, whose phone was broken for a period prior to her death. Smith was adamant that if her mother had known her electricity was about to be cut off, she would have asked for help.

Rowell expressed ""empathy for the family"" and said that APS' ""top concern was that [New Times] heard from somebody about a family member who died."" APS would be reaching out Jeanine Smith to express condolences, she added.

Asked why APS would be doing that now, after Smith had already spoken with someone at APS shortly after her mother's death, Rowell acknowledged that Smith had filed an informal complaint at the Corporation Commission and that ""we worked with her through that process.""

Smith did not want to talk to APS again.

“There’s nothing they can do or say to change it,"" she said. ""I just want policy change.”

On Wednesday, APS began a temporary suspension of all disconnections for customers behind on their bills, so it could take a step back and re-examine its practices. The company planned to tell customers on Wednesday night and send out a media release shortly thereafter, Rowell said.

The company already had been looking at its shutoff procedures in situations with unpaid bills and extreme heat, but learning about Pullman ""factored into our decision to put that [temporary suspension] into effect,"" Rowell said.

That temporary suspension is, for now, indefinite. As this story was going to publication, Phoenix was in the midst of its first extreme heat warning. APS spokesperson Jill Hanks said that due to the heat, the company was already holding off on disconnecting customers with unpaid bills this week.

Champion said the temperatures in her bill grew out of poring over medical examiner cases and noticing that people who lose air conditioning or electricity in their homes start to die when outdoor temperatures hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

The bill never made it out of committee."
‘We will not have a vaccine by next winter.’ CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. Why the second wave of 1918 Spanish flu was so devastating,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/we-will-not-have-a-vaccine-by-next-winter-what-happens-when-coronavirus-returns-2020-04-22,"America is staring down a widespread COVID-19 testing shortage with no vaccine in sight. So what happens when coronavirus makes its unceremonious return?

Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program and former epidemiologist specializing in infectious disease and public health, this month warned of complacency surrounding relaxation of social distancing measures.

“ Countries must ‘ensure that we continue on a downwards trajectory, and we don’t have an immediate second peak.’ ” — Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program

Countries should “continue to put in place the public-health and social measures, the surveillance measures, the testing measures and a comprehensive strategy to ensure that we continue on a downwards trajectory, and we don’t have an immediate second peak,” he told reporters.

He defined a second wave thus: “There will be a first wave of the disease by itself, and then it recurs months later, and that may be a reality for many countries in a number of months’ time.” He warned Brazil, No. 2 behind the U.S. with the most cases, not to relax measures until it has more testing.

As of Sunday, there were 498,440 confirmed cases in Brazil and at least 28,834 deaths; there are 1,775,125 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., and 103,906 deaths. Worldwide, there were 6,108,525 confirmed cases and 370,247 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Financial Times that he “can’t guarantee” more stay-at-home requirements in the winter or the fall. “We are committed to using the time that we have now to get this nation as over-prepared as possible.”

“We’ve seen evidence that the concerns it would go south in the southern hemisphere like flu [are coming true], and you’re seeing what’s happening in Brazil now,” Redfield told the U.K. paper, “and then when the southern hemisphere is over I suspect it will re-ground itself in the north.”

“This simple respiratory viral pathogen has really brought my nation to its knees, and the reality is, it’s no one particular person’s fault,” he added. (A Columbia University study released this month said up to 36,000 lives could have been saved had U.S. economy shut down even one week earlier.)

“ ‘We are committed to using the time that we have now to get this nation as over-prepared as possible.’ ” — Robert Redfield, director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades, previously declared, “We will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that.” He previously said the “ultimate game changer” will be a vaccine, but that could take 12 to 18 months.

“If we’re not expecting a second wave or a mutation of this virus, then we have learned nothing,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, added, calling it a “new normal” for public health in the U.S. “That is why it is such an important period for government.”

First, the bad news: “The four seasonal coronaviruses do not seem to induce long-term immunity,” said Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccine response in adults and children at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

“We will not have a vaccine by next winter,” Poland added. “The Southern Hemisphere is just starting their fall and winter. They will have a severe course of this disease due to less preparedness, less medical infrastructure and less public infrastructure.”

“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” Redfield, the CDC director, previously told The Washington Post.

Letter from New York:‘When I hear an ambulance, I wonder if there’s a coronavirus patient inside. Are there more 911 calls, or do I notice every distant siren?’

Coronavirus immunity differs from other diseases. Immunizations against smallpox, measles or Hepatitis B should last a lifetime, Poland said. Coronaviruses, first discovered in the 1960s, interact with our immune system in unique and different ways, he added.

How do other coronaviruses compare to SARS-CoV-2? People infected by SARS-CoV, an outbreak that centered in southern China and Hong Kong from 2002 to 2004, had immunity for roughly two years; studies suggest the antibodies disappear six years after the infection.

For MERS-CoV, a coronavirus that has caused hundreds of cases in the Middle East, people retain immunity for approximately 18 months — although the long-term response to being exposed to the virus again may depend on the severity of the original infection.

The world, Poland said, should brace itself for round two: “We will start moving into our summer when they’re moving into their winter,” he said. “If, as is likely, we don’t restrict all travel, cases will start coming back into the Northern Hemisphere and we’ll have another outbreak this fall.”

It’s too early for ‘herd immunity’ to be effective

Without a vaccine, “herd immunity” is another option. That theory was briefly considered in the U.K. as an alternative to closing businesses and practicing social distancing, but was deemed too risky. Ultimately, enough people would need to be immune to shield the most vulnerable.

“There’s no chance that immunity is going to be high enough to reach herd immunity,” Poland said. “With influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it’s somewhere in the middle.”

In the absence of a vaccine, Poland said several conditions are necessary for herd immunity to work: a very high level of population immunity, for that immunity to be durable, and for the virus to not mutate. “None of those seem to be operational at present,” he said.

“ With influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it’s somewhere in the middle. ” — Gregory Poland, who studies the immunogenetics of vaccines at the Mayo Clinic.

In addition to the level of herd immunity (or lack thereof) to protect those who are most vulnerable, people will have to be cognizant of the disease spreading through asymptomatic carriers — that is, people who are infected but show no signs that they’re ill.

For example, a New England Journal of Medicine study published this month found that 29 (or 14%) of 210 pregnant women arriving at New York–Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center tested positive for COVID-19, yet displayed no symptoms.

“Our use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all pregnant patients presenting for delivery revealed that at this point in the pandemic in New York City, most of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery were asymptomatic,” the study concluded.

“It underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients,” added the study, which was published earlier this month. “Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.”

Lessons in immunity from the Spanish flu of 1918

So what will happen if or when SARS-CoV-2, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, returns? “We’re just 14 weeks into this, so no one knows,” Poland said. If it has a slight mutation, he added, the response of our antibodies will be “moderately irrelevant.”

We can’t expect to have the same “herd immunity” or “original antigenic sin” — the ability of our immune systems to remember a virus that is similar, but not the same, as a previous version — as influenza. Influenza, after all, has been around for 500, if not 1,000 years.

“During the great influenza pandemic of 1918, the age group that disproportionately died were young people, not older adults,” Poland said. “Older adults had seen previews of this virus in earlier years, probably in the late 1800s, so they had immunological memory.”

“ ‘The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating than the first wave. COVID-19’s sweet spot could be October to May.’ ” — Ravina Kullar, adjunct faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles.

There are similarities between influenza and SARS-CoV-2, and they have almost identical symptoms — fever, coughing, night sweats, aching bones, tiredness, and nausea and diarrhea in the most severe cases. Like all viruses, neither are treatable with antibiotics.

They can both be spread through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing, but they come from two different virus families — and ongoing research to develop a universal vaccine for influenza shows how tricky both influenza viruses and coronaviruses can be.

“The 1918 Spanish flu’s second wave was even more devastating than the first wave,” Ravina Kullar, an infectious-disease expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America and adjunct faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles, told MarketWatch.

Historians believe that a more virulent influenza strain hit during a hard three months in 1918 and was spread by troops moving through Europe during the First World War. A mutated strain would be a worst-case scenario for a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 this fall or winter.

The 1918 pandemic is forever associated with Spain, but this strain of H1-N1 was discovered earlier in Germany, France, the U.K. and the U.S., but similar to the Communist Party’s response to first cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, First World War censors buried or underplayed those reports.

”It is essential to consider the deep connections between the Great War and the influenza pandemic not simply as concurrent or consecutive crises, but more deeply intertwined,” historian James Harris wrote in an essay on the pandemic.

“ A more virulent, mutated strain of the novel coronavirus would be a worst-case scenario for a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 this fall or winter. ”

The British military medicine took a leading role in studying the public-health response, he added. “Domestic public-health leaders did almost nothing to stem the spread of the pandemic due to the impact measures such as quarantine would have had on the war effort.

Doctors and members of the public, as of now, were spooked by how otherwise strong, healthy people fell victim to the 1918 influenza. Doctors today attribute that to the “cytokine storm,” a process where the immune system in healthy people reacts so strongly as to hurt the body.

A hallmark of some viruses: A surge of immune cells and their activating compounds (cytokines) effectively turned the body against itself, led to an inflammation of the lungs, severe respiratory distress, leaving the body vulnerable to secondary bacterial pneumonia.

And the second wave of SARS-CoV-2? “It will likely hit harder in areas not severely impacted the first time in the interior of the U.S., where there’s a lot more susceptible people,” Kullar said. “COVID-19’s sweet spot could be October to May, with it peaking, likely, in October and November.”

Kullar said scientists are learning something new every day from modeling studies. “If it follows the same pattern as influenza, it will likely level off during the summertime,” she said. “If immunity is in existence, then likely the virus will come back looking for new victims.”

What’s more, Redfield told the Washington Post that he’s been in talks with state officials about the potential for using U.S. Census Bureau, Peace Corps and AmeriCorps volunteers to create what he called “an alternative workforce” to help with contact tracing for those who test positive.

Testing will determine the rate of asymptomatic carriers

There is reason to be optimistic. “We still have a lot to learn about the flu, even though we’ve had flu vaccines since the mid-1940s,” Poland said. “It’s amazing what the world has done in 14 weeks on COVID-19, but what’s more amazing is how much more there is to learn.”

In a few short months, scientists around the world have learned a lot about SARS-CoV-2, including the virus’s genetic structure; how it infects human cells; what kind of disease manifestation it causes; and how it impacts the liver, kidney and brain, and how secondary symptoms affect children.

“ ‘We really need to have wide-scale testing available, and contact tracing to find everyone who has been exposed.’ ” — Ravina Kullar, an expert with the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

What else, aside from social distancing to “flatten the curve” of new infections, can be done between now and then? While scientists work to crack the code of the novel coronavirus, the government and members of the public can work together.

“It all comes down to testing,” Kullar said. “We really need to have wide-scale testing available, and contact tracing to find everyone who has been exposed and get them to self-isolate for 14 days. We don’t have a system like that in the U.S. at present.”

Cuomo said he won’t be swayed by protesters in the capital, adding that the CDC set reopening guidelines for states, and he will close again after reopening, if need be. “The health-care system cannot go over 70% capacity. There’s a two-week lag. At 70%, bells should go off.”

Dispatches from a pandemic: New York’s empty streets remind me of my childhood in a Wild West ghost town — how America can revive itself post-pandemic

Assuming testing is up to speed by the end of summer, Kullar says Americans should be on a sound footing for round two of SARS-CoV-2 with, ideally, enough hospital supplies and testing in place to ensure we all make fewer mistakes next time around.

In Europe, Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told The Guardian newspaper earlier this month that she too expects a second wave. “The question is when and how big,” she said, adding that 85% to 90% of the population is still susceptible.

Ammon said SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to just go away. “The virus is around us, circulating much more than January and February,” she said this week. “I don’t want to draw a doomsday picture but I think we have to be realistic. That it’s not the time now to completely relax.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, -3.43% and S&P 500 SPX, -3.52% closed broadly flat Friday. Equity indexes have ricocheted in recent weeks as the markets remained hopeful of a short-term impact of coronavirus on earnings, helped by progress on research into a vaccine.

In the meantime, a lot will come down to the public. “How we behave will really determine how big this virus is going to get,” she said. “Maintain social distancing and wear masks in public until we see infection rates go down, and keep doing it until we get enough testing.”"

'We may have to ration': US food banks face shortages as demand surges

Food banks face going millions of dollars over budget as they struggle to meet surging demand from those hit hard by mass layoffs caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Across the US, not-for-profit groups are buying truckloads of increasingly expensive food to cope with the sharp increase in the “new needy” – and the dramatic decline in donations from supermarkets left empty by panic shoppers.

'A perfect storm': US facing hunger crisis as demand for food banks soars Read more

The pressures are widespread and growing, according to more than 20 food banks and pantries across 15 states consulted by the Guardian. For example, in Pennsylvania, food banks are spending an extra $1m a week and yet still turning hungry families away.

In Alabama, one pantry looks set to go $3.6m over budget by August as food purchases and running costs – electricity, cleaning materials, boxes and overtime – have tripled: “We’re applying for grants as fast as we can,” said Jenny Waltman from Grace Klein pantry in Birmingham.

The recent rise in public donations is unlikely to offset projected shortfalls.

“We have enough food for the next month,” warned Lisa Scales, president of Pittsburgh food bank where the money spent buying food has tripled. “With so many businesses shutting, we’re concerned community donations won’t sustain this level.”

Quick guide How you can help US food banks in the Covid-19 pandemic Show Hide How to help Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs. As this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help. Donate money or supplies The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families. If you want to help, find your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund. Volunteers Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use Feeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice. Social media Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.

The economic fallout of the global health crisis has seen record numbers of first-timers – people who have never previously needed food aid – flocking to new drive-thru distribution centres, which have been created to comply with social distancing rules.

Queues up to six miles long have become common at these pop-up collection points as far afield as San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Cleveland, where thousands of recently furloughed and unemployed people wait hours for grocery boxes.

As demand escalates, the price of non-perishable staples such as peanut butter, eggs, canned vegetables, beans, pasta, rice and jam is soaring, while supplies are running low with four- to eight-week delays and bottlenecks reported across the supply chain.

The wholesale cost of rice has almost tripled and won’t be delivered until June, according to one Pennsylvania-based distributor that supplies more than 40 food banks. “Canned fruit and veg are very hard to get, rice and pasta is challenging, and costs have gone crazy as manufacturers pay more for labor, food and transport,” said Mike Fellinger.

“If you find rice it’s like gold,” added Ron Mizutani, president of the Hawaii food bank.

In response, innovative schemes have emerged to take advantage of an abundance of perishable produce such as tomatoes, apples and milk which would otherwise be dumped or left rotting in fields. An estimated 30-40% of the US food supply is wasted, which is the equivalent to throwing out $161bn of produce annually.

However, in one plan, Feeding Florida is paying local farmers to continue harvesting thousands of acres of crops, some of which is turned into freezable soups, sauces and ready meals by a network of idle restaurateurs.

‘Crisis mode’

The unfolding public health crisis has triggered the worst economic crisis in almost a century, exposing the precarious state of millions of working Americans thanks to weak labor rights, eroded government safety nets and low wages.

“It’s not surprising to see so many ‘new needy’, when even before the pandemic, millions of working Americans were already living on the edge of poverty, making tough choices between food and rent and bills every month,” said Ellen Vollinger, legal director at the Washington-based Food Research and Action Centre (Frac).

In 2019, about 40 million Americans received free meals or groceries through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, schools, soup kitchens and shelters, according to Feeding America. The working poor, elderly and disabled and infirm accounted for the vast majority of recipients.

Even before the pandemic, half of American adults had either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate’s 2019 financial security index.

Since then, more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, though the true number of layoffs is probably significantly higher.

Unsurprisingly, the demand for food aid has risen exponentially, and is mostly driven by first-timers, according to groups in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington.

For instance, at pantries in Silicon Valley, demand is increasing about 50% each week, with first-timers such as security and cafeteria staff furloughed by tech companies, teachers and restaurant workers accounting for more than half of those needing food.

“It’s not surprising. We already knew a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck,” said Leslie Bacho, chief executive of Second Harvest food bank, which spent $250,000 on cleaning supplies in March.

No savings and staggering debts: in 2019 Americans owed $14tn including $1.3tn in car loans, $1tn on credit cards, $1.48tn in student loans and $9.4tn to mortgage lenders.

In Las Vegas, drivers of luxury vehicles queued for food boxes. “When you see a Lexus in line at 4am prepared to wait six hours, you know there’s real need,” said Larry Scott from Nevada’s Three Square food bank.

In Seattle , Washington, the Northwest Harvest food bank expects expenditure to increase eightfold to $8.4m a month through September.

Feeding Alabama expects to spend $1.71m purchasing food by July – compared to $1.1m during 2018, and $543,443 in 2019 when food banks benefited from a commodities surplus created by Donald Trump’s trade wars.

In Louisiana, at least one in three people are at risk of hunger, compared with one in five before this crisis, according to Natalie Jayroe, president of South Harvest food bank. “We think it will conservatively cost us $15m for six months … In south Louisiana, we’ve been through our share of disasters but this is different.”

The Greater Cleveland food bank could go $4.9m – or 26% – over budget by September. They have stopped buying peanut butter, a high-protein grocery box staple, since the price rose $10 a case.

Last week in San Antonio, Texas, an unprecedented 10,000 people showed up in their cars for a pop-up distribution centre – a drive-thru service which typically attracted 400 before the layoffs. That day, 25 semi-trucks of food were handed out, much of it to newly laid off hospitality staff whose last paycheck was already gone, according to Eric Cooper, president of the food bank.

As demand rises, Cooper warns that supplies will run short: “The only thing we can do is ration and give families less … I would challenge our federal government to put systems in place that allow for wasted food to go to families we are feeding. It’s unconscionable.”

As the coronavirus economic hurt intensifies, federal aid is slowly starting to trickle down to ordinary people, including the $1,200 stimulus payment for those with bank accounts.

The rescue packages did expand the food stamps programme (Snap), but the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has so far refused to fully extend eligibility using available disaster powers. “This would help tackle hunger and stimulate the economy, but for some reason the USDA isn’t using all the tools in its box,” said Vollinger from Frac.

It’s unclear when or how the country will return to some semblance of normal, meanwhile America’s hunger crisis is likely to last months – or longer.

Kristin Warzocha of Greater Cleveland said: “I already fear we’re not reaching everyone who needs help, and we haven’t seen anything yet! We will do everything in our power, but philanthropy is not going to fix this crisis.”"
"Climate change disproportionately impacts and will impact the poor in the developing world, even though they are the least responsible on an emissions-per-capita basis",https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/climate-change-affects-poverty,"The facts: How climate change affects people living in poverty







Around the world, people are experiencing both the subtle and stark effects of climate change. Gradually shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events are all clear and devastating evidence of a rapidly changing climate. The impacts of climate change affect every country on every continent. They’re creating unprecedented challenges for millions of people already burdened by poverty and oppression. The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires and droughts threaten the world's food supply, drive people from their homes, separate families and jeopardize livelihoods. And all of these effects increase the risk of conflict, hunger and poverty. Visible evidence and climbing numbers demonstrate that climate change is not a distant or imaginary threat, but rather a growing and undeniable reality. The situation is dire. Climate change has become a climate crisis.

The latest United Nations climate change report warns that our window to address the threat is shrinking rapidly. And it's people living in poverty who have the most to lose. For those on the frontlines of the crisis, the struggle to earn a living, feed their families and create safe and stable homes is made more difficult every day. The climate crisis discriminates, but the efforts to fight it cannot. And though the work to protect the global environment is essential, so are efforts to protect people around the world. Solutions that help vulnerable communities are often overlooked. Mercy Corps is collaborating with our community partners and the world’s most innovative organizations to reshape how humanity can adapt and thrive.

Climate change threatens the cleanliness of our air, depletes our water sources and limits food supply. It disrupts livelihoods, forces families from their homes and pushes people into poverty. Research suggests the planet has lost around one-third of its arable land over the past 40 years, in large part due to climate disasters and poor conservation, and every year more trees and soil are lost. More than 1.3 billion people live on deteriorating agricultural land, putting them at risk of depleted harvests that can lead to worsening hunger, poverty and displacement. Soil is being lost between 10 and 100 times faster than it is forming. And natural disasters are becoming increasingly frequent and destructive. The number of people affected by natural disasters doubled from approximately 102 million in 2015 to 204 million in 2016. Fewer people were affected in 2017, but at a higher price, with the year’s events costing a total of $335 billion and driving a 49 percent increase in economic losses over the previous decade. These damages can be nearly impossible for families living in poverty to overcome. As climate events worsen, people are also threatened by more gradual changes, such as climbing temperatures and declining rainfall. Droughts alone have affected more than 1 billion people in the last decade, and the damage hits the agriculture industry — the primary source of food and income for many people in developing countries — particularly hard. Between 2006 and 2016, more than 80 percent of drought damage was absorbed by agriculture, and 2017 data from the World Bank reported drought has wiped out enough produce to feed 81 million people every day for a year since 2001. As these situations grow more desperate, food shortages could also force families to leave their homes and migrate to other countries. “We see climate as a magnifier, and in many cases a multiplier, of existing underlying causes of risk.” — Sarah Henly-Shepard, Mercy Corps Senior Advisor for Climate Change and Resilience Climate change is one of many root causes of conflict around the world: it leads to food shortages, threatens people’s livelihoods, and displaces entire populations. Where institutions and governments are unable to manage the stress or absorb the shocks of a changing climate, threats to the stability of states and societies will only increase. Who is most affected by climate change? While everyone around the world feels the effects of climate change, the most vulnerable are people living in the world’s poorest countries — like Haiti and Timor-Leste — and the world’s 2.5 billion smallholder farmers, herders and fisheries who depend on the climate and natural resources for food and income. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, shifting seasons, and natural disasters disproportionately threaten these populations, increasing their risk and their dependency on humanitarian aid.

Three out of four people living in poverty rely on agriculture and natural resources to survive. For these people, the effects of climate change — shifting weather, limited water sources and increased competition for resources — are a real matter of life and death. Climate change has turned their lives into a desperate guessing game. As the effects of climate change increase, so will their desperation.

How does climate change increase conflict?

Thousands have been killed and displaced by a surge in violence and reprisal attacks, in large part over diminishing resources like land and water. Photo: Ezra Millstein/Mercy Corps

Conflict is the primary cause of poverty and suffering in the world today. And it’s exacerbated by climate change. By amplifying existing environmental, social, political and economic challenges, climate change increases the likelihood of competition and conflict over resources. It can also intensify existing conflicts and tensions.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, shifts in the timing and magnitude of rainfall undermine food production and increase competition for remaining arable land, contributing to ethnic tensions and conflict. And in places like central Nigeria and Karamoja, an area of land that straddles the border of Kenya and Uganda, where resource scarcity has been a long-standing challenge, climate change has further reduced pasture and water resources, increasing competition and resulting in violence, such as cattle raiding. “Climate change is not a distant threat. It’s a driver of fragility and conflict, and it’s leading to a hungrier and more vulnerable world.” — Eliot Levine, Mercy Corps Deputy Director of Environment, Energy and Climate But while climate change can lead to conflict, it can also provide an opportunity for collaboration. These challenges present a unique opportunity for collective action and cooperation in order to mitigate the impacts. For some communities, food, health and lives will depend on cooperation over conflict. In Uganda, Mercy Corps is helping one South Sudanese refugee form a friendship without borders ▸ What’s the relationship between hunger and climate change? Climate change threatens the world's food supply. Floods and droughts brought on by climate change make it harder to produce food. As a result, the price of food increases, and access becomes more and more limited, putting many at higher risk of hunger.

Undernutrition is the largest health impact of climate change in the 21st century. The number of undernourished people in the world has been increasing since 2014, reaching nearly 821 million — a staggering 11 percent of the entire global population — in 2017. The vast majority live in developing countries — research shows hunger to be particularly on the rise in South America and almost every region in Africa. More than 30 percent of people in eastern Africa faced hunger in 2017. Much of the increase is linked to the growing number of conflicts, which are often exacerbated by climate-related shocks. According to the 2019 Global Report on Food Crises, more than 113 million people in 53 countries were plunged into crisis levels of hunger in 2018; two-thirds of them were in places affected by conflict or insecurity. And climate and natural disasters alone triggered food crises for an additional 29 million people — mostly in Africa — with shocks such as drought leaving them in need of urgent assistance. How does climate change create climate refugees? Rising sea levels, extreme weather events and prolonged drought force millions of people to lose or move away from their homes every year in search of food, water, shelter or jobs. More than 60 percent of all new displacements last year were the result of weather-related disasters, with a total of 17.2 million people around the world being driven from their homes by shocks like drought, hurricanes and landslides — almost 50,000 people every day.

Meanwhile, gradual changes brought on by deforestation, overgrazing and decreased rainfall slowly transform pastures to dust, destroy crops and kill livestock, effectively challenging the livelihoods of millions of farmers. These families are forced to leave their homes behind in search of basic necessities and new work. And as sea levels continue to rise, those living near the ocean — about 40 percent of the world’s population — will be left with no choice but to move inland. Almost all of these displacements are occurring in developing countries, where people have fewer resources on hand to cope with progressive shifts or sudden disasters. More climate refugees will be displaced as the situation worsens. What’s the forecast for the future and climate change? The impacts of climate change continue to exceed previous scientific forecasts, worsening and multiplying at dramatic rates that will only be amplified in the years to come.

Access to clean water is likely to become even more limited, and the risk of hunger and famine will become even greater than it is today. By 2050, climate change reportedly has the potential to increase the number of people at risk of hunger by as much as 20 percent. The majority of those at risk live in Africa. Tens of millions of people are expected to be forced from their homes in the next decade as a result of climate change. This would be the biggest refugee crisis the world has ever seen. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to kill an additional 250,000 people each year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress, while continuing to jeopardize clean air, safe drinking water and sufficient food supply. How is Mercy Corps helping?

Around the world, in places as diverse as Puerto Rico, Ethiopia, Mongolia and Indonesia, Mercy Corps is helping people adapt to climate change. We do this work by considering the challenges each community is facing and then developing localized solutions that will make the biggest impact. In order to create real and lasting change, the social, economic and political realities underpinning climate change must be addressed, in addition to mitigating the effects on the ground. Our climate resilience work tackles the impacts of climate change — particularly disappearing livelihoods, rising food insecurity, increasing disaster and escalating violence — by empowering communities to adapt, innovate and thrive. Read more about our approach to climate-resilient development ▸ Helping alleviate hunger and loss of livelihoods As weather patterns become more unpredictable, small-scale farmers around the world are facing new challenges to grow their crops and their livelihoods. We’re helping them get more out of the resources they have by connecting them with a network of information and services. We’re pioneering new ways of putting reliable climate information and services in the hands of those we work with — improving individual, household and community capacity to cope with change. In some cases this means working with government and private sector technology companies to increase the ability to access the information they need to reduce their risks.

We help farmers diversify their crops and redesign their farmland to maximize their productivity and protect the soil in the face of increasingly severe and frequent droughts. We also train herders on how to keep their animals healthy in drier conditions. To support their work, we also help increase their access to banking services such as loans and savings, as well as insurance products to help protect their hard work. We connect many of our farmers and herders — like those in Kenya and Mongolia — with new technologies they can access with their mobile phones. These technologies provide weather updates, crop prices, and resources they can explore around preventing diseases and increasing yields. REPORT: How investing in resilience helps fight drought ▸

Our work even extends to adapting market systems that can thrive in a changing climate. In water-scarce Jordan, we’re introducing cutting edge drip irrigation technology to farmers, and providing real-time satellite data to determine where irrigation services need to be supplied and extended. In Afghanistan, we’re establishing new agricultural markets to link farmers with potential buyers and maximize their income, create more jobs and enhance rural economies. How we're helping herders build resilience in rural Ethiopia ▸ Preparing communities for worsening disasters Natural disasters are growing more frequent and more severe, threatening the lives of the world’s most vulnerable people and the infrastructure they depend on. We help communities rebound from disasters while strengthening them to be more resilient to the next ones. We do that by investing in and initiating disaster mitigation tactics. These tactics help people better prepare for disasters to come. In Tajikistan, we reinforced river embankments to slow the effects of flooding. In Indonesia, we’re addressing the growing challenge of urban flooding, which climate change is making worse, by helping people identify when flooding might occur, developing early warning systems and establishing evacuation routes.

Around the world, we’re also teaching students and community members about climate impact, risk management and disaster preparedness so they’re better prepared for the future. In Puerto Rico, we’ve developed resilience hubs, taking existing community centers and providing them with solar power and disaster response kits, facilitating search-and-rescue trainings and developing community action plans, so community members know what to do to stay safe in the event of an emergency. We also collaborate with local and national governments to improve their ability to manage and prepare for weather-related risks. We work with governments to improve the way water and land is managed, build and manage plans for improving disaster response, and support the development of policies and plans that reduce vulnerability to climate change. CASE STUDY: A governance approach to building climate resilience in Indonesia ▸ Addressing conflict caused by climate change With the climate crisis causing natural resources to vanish, competition for remaining resources is on the rise. To resolve conflict and stop violence before it starts, we help communities and their governments build for the future where people protect and share natural resources. We provide the tools for people to overcome their differences and collectively manage resources — like training community leaders to build conflict management skills. “Climate change increases the risk of conflict. It degrades land and leads to competition over precious natural resources. Over time, conflict can displace entire communities and lead to life-threatening hunger. But we can prevent it, if we proactively focus on these environmental risks and bring communities together to find solutions.” — Jenny Vaughan, Mercy Corps Director of Peace and Conflict We see the shared experience of climate change as an opportunity for cooperation and collaboration, reducing the risk of conflict. For example, in Uganda, we are facilitating resource-sharing agreements and promoting cooperation between communities to reduce conflict, providing a space for people living there to pursue new types of work such as cooking, cleaning or construction."

U.S. National Debt Soars Past $26 Trillion,https://www.thecryptoassociate.com/why-crypto-matters-u-s-national-debt-soars-past-26-trillion/,"Quick Take

U.S. national debt soars past $26 trillion amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The U.S. Federal Reserve balance sheet has surpassed $7 trillion as COVID-19 economic relief continues.

The U.S. national debt has soared past $26 trillion for the first time as economic relief continues amid the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. national debt is up over 12% since January, an increase of nearly $3 trillion.

More importantly, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-partisan organization, estimates that federal debt will grow by $4 trillion in 2020.

Furthermore, U.S. national debt has been climbing at a rapid pace, growing by over $1 trillion since May 3. The soaring U.S. national debt may raise concerns over the U.S.’s ability to sustain the growing debt, which may have significant implications for the U.S. Dollar, the world’s reserve currency.

Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Soars

The U.S. Federal Reserve balance sheet has also been on the rise amid the coronavirus outbreak. The balance sheet has surpassed $7 trillion for the first time in the nation’s history after growing by nearly $3 trillion since January of this year.

Quantitative easing may be playing a substantial role in the recent balance sheet growth. Quantitative easing (QE) is a type of monetary policy by which central banks purchase assets from the market. Through QE, governments are essentially injecting money into the economy with hopes of economic stimulation. As reported earlier by The Crypto Associate, the Federal Reserve will continue asset purchases and keep interest rates near-zero.

Millennials say anxiety about money is literally making them sick,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/millennials-say-anxiety-about-money-is-literally-making-them-sick-2017-09-01?link=sfmw_tw,"Ariana Grande has a message for anyone suffering from anxiety: Just breathe.

The 25-year-old performer released the music video for her single “Breathin’” on Wednesday, showing herself feeling isolated or behind clouds. “Time goes by and I can’t control my mind,” she sings. “I know I gotta keep, I keep on breathin’.” She told Jimmy Fallon in August the song was based on her own experiences. “It’s about anxiety and feeling like you can’t get a full breath,” she said. “It’s like the worst feeling in the whole world.”

Many Americans are in an anxious state as of late. This year’s national anxiety score was 51 out of 100, an increase of five points since 2017, according to an American Psychiatric Association poll. Anxiety scores jumped for all age groups, races and genders. Barnes & Noble US:BKS saw a 26% increase in sales of books about anxiety between 2017 and 2018, the company noted.

People suffer from anxiety about a whole host of problems: relationships, work, substance abuse or money. And mental health issues can take a toll on finances: about half of people with problems like anxiety also struggle with problem debt, a 2010 study by the Royal College of Physicians found.

When Claudia Pennington, 32, started to get serious about conquering her debt, she owed more than $200,000. She and her husband Garrett, who live in Lancaster, Pa., owed $156,000 on their mortgage, plus $16,500 in credit card bills and $36,000 in student loans.

At the time, she was “always worried about money,” she said, and found herself constantly checking their debt balance and the amount in their checking account.

The anxiety even affected her at work.

“I tried to toe the line,” she said of working in marketing before she became self-employed. “I didn’t want to make waves for fear of losing my job, even though I had some suggestions for how to improve things.”

The Penningtons have now paid off the entirety of their debt — by selling their house, cutting back on spending and boosting their incomes, a journey they’ve chronicled on their blog, Two Cup House — and the anxiety has mostly gone away, too. But the constant fear of not having enough funds plagues their entire generation.

More than a quarter of millennials say financial stress affects their job performance, over twice the rate of the general population who feels that way, according to a study of more than 2,000 people released in 2017 by insurance and financial planning company Northwestern Mutual.

Financial anxiety also has made about a quarter of millennials feel physically ill, according to the study, and has made more than half feel depressed.

Kara Perez, a 29-year-old living in Austin, said she felt sick because of her anxiety about money when she graduated from college in 2011 with more than $25,000 in student loans. She was unable to find full-time work and worked various part-time jobs, including as a caterer and receptionist.

Perez said she remembers crying a lot at the time, and she felt she was “swimming in a sea of anxiety.”

“I often feel anxiety in the pit of my stomach,” she said. “It would manifest as nausea for me.”

Here's how to pick retail companies that will survive the meltdown

For many millennials, who came of age and entered the job market during the economic recession, the bad feelings are pervasive. Some 69% said they experienced anxiety because of their income, 67% said it was because of their level of savings and 53% said it was because of worry about losing their job.

“So much of anxiety is just feeling out of control,” said Chantel Bonneau, a wealth management advisor at Northwestern Mutual. “You can never just check a box and say, ‘I handled my financial planning.’ It’s every day of your life you’re forced to make decisions.”

The high cost of housing also presents challenges, and millennials have more student loan debt than any previous generation.

“Millennials really do want a plan, and they are aware they need to save,” Bonneau said. “It’s not the same ball game to buy a property it was maybe 50 years ago or even 25 years ago.”

But for those who do have jobs and incomes, there are some places they can make cuts that could ease the anxiety and put them on a path to saving for a house or other major goal, Bonneau said.

About a third of the millennials surveyed said they were prone to excessive or frivolous spending, more than the 26% of those in Generation X and 19% of baby boomers who said this. About a third of millennials also said they have ended up spending money they budgeted for other things, like savings, on themselves. Just 15% of those in Generation X and 4% of baby boomers said this.

In fact, millennials spend more than an average of $2,300 per year than older generations on key items including groceries, gas, restaurants, coffee and cellphone bills, a survey from the personal-finance website Bankrate.com found. Millennials spent $233 a month on meals compared with $182 in older generations and $161 per month on cellphone charges, versus $135 for people in older generations. (Still, millennials spend less than older generations do on travel and television-related costs.)

Pennington and her husband cut dining out and travel from their budgets at first, she said.

Bonneau suggested staying off social media so you don’t fall into a “compare and despair” trap.

She also suggested thinking of financial goals in smaller steps, to avoid feeling “hopeless” about larger goals like owning a home or retirement.

Actually creating a financial plan, whether on your own or with a financial adviser, is another good strategy, she said; just one-third of American adults write out a budget at all, according to a survey from polling company Gallup.

For her own clients, for example, it can be helpful to show them projections that illustrate how just adding one or two percent more of their income into a 401k can make a big difference over time, she said.

“If you were saving 0% yesterday and we can get you to saving 3%, that’s a huge victory,” Bonneau said. “It’s about progress.”

Pennington said she wishes she would have focused more on boosting her family’s income, rather than only on the small budget cuts, which add up, but slowly.

But like Bonneau, she also said goal-setting can work, even with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt looming.

“Focus more on the daily actions and steps to get there, rather than the anxiety,” she said.

Perez was able to completely pay off her student loans four years after graduating. She took various part-time jobs including as a nanny, a van driver for a high-school golf team, a high school lacrosse coach and a freelancer for social media clients.

Now, she has started a financial literacy company for women called Bravely.

“Even when you’re feeling at your lowest, the most stressed out, and when the numbers feel like they won’t add up, it’s possible,” she said. “Keep the faith.”"
"'Most devastating plague of locusts' in recent history could come within weeks, U.N. warns",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/most-devastating-plague-locusts-recent-history-could-come-within-weeks-n1133171,"GAROWE, Somalia — At a glance, the desert locusts in this arid patch of northern Somalia look less ominous than the billion-member swarms infesting East Africa in the worst outbreak some places have seen in 70 years.

But their time will come.

Small and wingless, the hopping young locusts are the next wave in the outbreak that threatens more than 10 million people across the region with a severe hunger crisis.

And they are growing up in one of the most inaccessible places on the planet. Large parts of Somalia south of this semi-autonomous Puntland region are under threat, or held by, the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group. That makes it difficult or impossible to conduct the aerial spraying of the locusts that experts say is the only effective control.

Somalia has declared the outbreak a national emergency. Across the region, it has the potential “to be the most devastating plague of locusts in any of our living memories if we don't reduce the problem faster than we're doing at the moment,” U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said.

As an armed Somali policeman stood by, experts on Thursday walked across the dry land crawling with the young locusts and explained the threat to come if the world doesn’t act right now.

“The world needs to know this is where it all begins,” said Alberto Trillo Barca, a spokesman for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. “In the next three or four weeks, these nymphs, as we call them, will develop wings.”

Then they are expected to set off for neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, where a handful of planes spraying pesticide can only do so much if such swarms keep arriving.

Climate experts have pointed to unusually heavy rains, aided by a powerful cyclone off Somalia in December, as a major factor in the outbreak. The locusts were carried in by the storm’s winds from the Arabian Peninsula and parts beyond, and now they are feeding on Somalia's fresh vegetation.

With more rains expected in the region in the coming weeks, the number of locusts if unchecked could grow by up to 500 times by June, when drier weather is expected.

But that drier weather is not necessarily the solution, said Dominique Burgeon, the FAO’s emergency and resilience director.

The density of the locusts is now so high that even normal moisture can lead to another generation, he said.

“We cannot believe in Mother Nature to solve it,” he explained.

Without enough spraying to stop the swarms, the already worrying outbreak could turn into a plague, “and when you have a plague, it takes years to control,” he said.

Against that sweeping outlook, a few masked workers with white protective suits and pesticide containers strapped to their backs stood in the camel-crossed Somali desert, spritzing the thousands of locusts clinging to thorny bushes.

The world's changing climate brings the risk of more cyclones coming in from the warming Indian Ocean off East Africa, climate experts say. With that, the likelihood of further locust outbreaks grows.

The “sort of new normal,” Burgeon said.

And that means Kenya, Ethiopia and other East African countries that rarely see such outbreaks and found themselves largely unprepared for this one could join “frontline countries” in parts of West Africa and the Middle East, experts say. Those countries have well-trained monitoring and prevention systems in place for more frequent locust outbreaks.

The FAO has asked international donors to give $76 million immediately to help control this outbreak. So far $19 million is in hand, Burgeon said.

“The biggest challenge is the scale of the breeding, as you can see all around us,” Barca said. These locusts, he said, will be migrating to southern Somalia and parts of Kenya and Ethiopia just as crops are germinating there.

“If at that time there are huge quantities of locusts around, it will have a devastating impact on the crops,” Burgeon said.

Other East African countries including South Sudan, Eritrea and Djibouti are also at risk, Burgeon said. Millions of people in some of these places are already facing hunger in the wake of civil war or more common challenges such as poverty.

Locusts began to arrive Sunday in Uganda, reaching a village near the Kenyan border, according to Martin Owor, the country's commissioner in charge of disaster preparedness.

The swarm spotted in Amudat district was “certainly big,” and the prime minister was expected to lead an evening emergency meeting on Uganda's first major locust outbreak since the 1960s, Owor said.

Here in rural Somalia, where about 50% of the people depend on animals for their livelihoods, the locusts are eating the pasturage. The animals weaken, their milk decreases and small children, who depend on the milk to survive, suffer skyrocketing malnutrition, the experts said.

Those fighting the locust outbreak may try to negotiate with Somalia's extremist fighters to allow spraying in rural areas where they are active, Burgeon said. Already emergency workers are going in where they can.

In a few weeks the young locusts will shed their skin, said Keith Cressman, a senior locust forecasting officer with the FAO.

“It takes a few days to warm up their wings,” he said. Some test flights follow and they’re on the move.

The locusts at that stage are bright pink and in their most voracious state, like ""very hungry teenagers,” Cressman said. By now, many people in Kenya and Ethiopia know them well.

After a month or so, the locusts will be mature adults, ready to reproduce.

Soon after copulating and laying eggs the locusts will die, “but their progeny will be hatching,” Cressman said. “And we have another generation of locusts to contend with, with about another 20-fold increase.”"
France’s Gas Tax Disaster Shows We Can’t Save Earth by Screwing Over Poor People,https://earther.gizmodo.com/frances-gas-tax-disaster-shows-we-cant-save-earth-by-sc-1830877858?utm_source=earther_facebook&utm_campaign=socialflow_earther_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow,"Photo : Getty

France has turned into a bubbling cauldron of unrest over the past month as the so-called yellow vest movement has put up roadblocks and taken to the streets to protest a gas tax. Last week’s protests turned violent and facing a crisis, the government of Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday it would put a six-month moratorium on the tax.

The tax was meant to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. While it likely would’ve done that, it would’ve done so on the backs of France’s rural low and middle class. The mass revolt against it doesn’t mean those groups oppose climate action. It means that Macron needs to include them in discussions about the best way to address climate change as part of a just transition, something the world at-large is grappling with as it aims to get a handle on carbon emissions.

More than 280,000 protesters donned yellow safety vests that motorists are required to keep in their cars and took to the streets across France last weekend. The protests have arisen organically through Facebook and other social media platforms, and span the ideological divide. Their focus has largely been on the unfairness of Macron’s proposed gas tax, which would’ve raised prices by €0.029 per liter ($0.12 a gallon) on unleaded gas and €0.065 per liter ($0.24 a gallon) on diesel. Rising oil prices have pushed fuel prices higher stil l now was among the worst times to propose such a tax.

The French government has spent years promoting diesel, and the tax would’ve left many already struggling to make ends meet with higher fuel bills on vehicles they’ve been encouraged to buy. The money it raised would also have been used to combat the national deficit, which has been made worse in part by the Macron government’s policies, like lifting portions of a wealth tax. In short, the gas tax was a technocratic fix without any real constituency and the benefits were poorly explained, leaving it open to criticism and protest. The yellow vests enjoy a broad base of support with a recent poll showing that 72 percent of the French public is sympathetic to the cause.



The fight against the tax is not a fight against climate policy, however . “We are not against the ecology, on the contrary,” Benoit Julou, a spokesperson for the yellow vest movement, said on a France 3 talk show last week. Rather it shows that any policies that only consider climate benefits and are made top-down are destined to fail.

“Governments need to communicate clearly why change in all sectors of the economy is necessary to limit global warming and how it plans to buffer potentially negative social and economic implications,” Alexander Reitzenstein, a policy advisor at the European think tank Third Generation Environmentalism, told Earther. “The French government did not provide a credible plan for how to compensate particularly poorer households. Poor households are often most affected by higher fuel prices, higher electricity bills or higher costs for keeping homes warm.”

Reitzenstein is part of a growing group of researchers, policymakers, and advocates pushing for a just transition when it comes to climate change. Simply put, this is a way to ensure people working in the fossil fuel industry or other industries dependent on fossil fuels, as well as low income and disadvantaged communities in general, aren’t left holding the bag as the world tries to get a handle on carbon emissions. A just transition ensures that we create a world people want to live in and that everyone’s needs are accounted for.

Spain recently offered a buyout for coal miners as it plans to shut down the industry by the end of the year. A just transition is also a central tenet of the Green New Deal proposed by Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And it’s a theme of this year’s climate talks in Poland. Reitzenstein, who is at the talks, said that the French protests have been a “hot topic” among the conference halls and meeting rooms as delegates grapple with the need to address climate change in the most equitable way possible.

Ivetta Gerasimchuk, a researcher at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, pointed to policies in Indonesia that ended motor fuel subsidies in 2015 as an effective example of what transportation policy could look like.



“President Joko Widodo included subsidy reform in his election campaign explaining all the benefits that these budgetary savings can unlock,” she told Earther while noting it came at a time of low fuel prices. “Through this reform, Indonesia saved $15.6 billion and invested in budget increases for key areas including transport and other infrastructure and transfers to village.”

That illustrates some of the key principles Gerasimchuk said are part of just climate policies, including clearly communicating the benefits, engaging with communities, and building broad support. Macron could look at that as one avenue to build a new gas tax, but ultimately his government really needs to listen to the people in the streets. And those voices are speaking more loudly about the broader structural issues in France, many of which are found throughout the developed world associated with neoliberal policies that have driven inequality to some of the highest levels in modern history. The rising inequality also means the richest 10 percent of the world emit 50 percent of its carbon pollution, shining a potential glaring spotlight on who should pay the most to address climate change.

“Just transition and ambitious climate policy are two sides of the same coin, there is no choice to either do just transition or climate ambition,” Reitzenstein said.

"Microplastics ‘are everywhere’: in lakes, rivers and seas. Researchers study 10 water sources around the UK and find microplastics in all of them. “It’s now clear that microplastics should be considered a serious emerging contaminant...""",https://www.sustainability-times.com/environmental-protection/microplastics-are-absolutely-everywhere-in-lakes-rivers-and-seas/,"The River Thames in London. Ullswater in the UK’s Lake District. Loch Lomond in Scotland. What do they have in common? According to a new study, this: they all have been contaminated by microplastics, which have permeated water sources across the planet from the surface of rivers right down to the depths of the oceans.

A team of researchers from Bangor University in Wales and the nonprofit Friends of the Earth examined 10 water sources around the United Kingdom and found that microplastics have polluted all of them. Using a fluorescence lighting system, they identified and counted tiny plastics of less than 5mm in size in every liter of water they collected.

They found that microplastic pollution levels range from more than a 1,000 pieces of plastic per liter in the river Tame in Greater Manchester to 2.4 pieces per liter in Loch Lomond in Scotland. “It was startling. I wasn’t expecting to find as much as we did,” said Christian Dunn, an expert at Bangor University who led the research. “It is quite depressing they were there in some of our country’s most iconic locations,” he added.

“Microplastics are being found absolutely everywhere [but] we do not know the dangers they could be posing,” Dunn went on. “It’s no use looking back in 20 years time and saying: ‘If only we’d realised just how bad it was.’ We need to be monitoring our waters now and we need to think, as a country and a world, how we can be reducing our reliance on plastic.”

Microplastics, such as microbeads used in cosmetics, pose grave risks to marine animals, many of which either mistake them for food or, like whales, accidentally swallow large quantities of them. Worse: the sand grain-size plastics, scientists say, act like magnets for pollutants in water as these pollutants attach themselves to microbeads and can pass into the fish that feed on them. That way they enter the food chain and we often end up digesting them ourselves to the effect that microplastics can start accumulating in our own guts.

“Plastic is polluting our rivers, lakes and wetlands in a similar way as pollutants such as so-called ’emerging contaminants’ like pharmaceutical waste, personal care products and pesticides,” Dunn says. “[I]t’s now clear that microplastics should be considered a serious emerging contaminant and there needs to be a concerted effort to regularly monitor all our inland waters for them.”"
US troops are increasingly falling to heatstroke during training as the military braces for rising temperatures,https://taskandpurpose.com/us-troops-are-increasingly-falling-to-heatstroke-during-training-as-the-military-braces-for-rising-temperatures,"US troops are increasingly falling to heatstroke during training as the military braces for rising temperatures

The military has a climate change problem.

As global temperatures rise, the number of heat-related illness diagnoses of active-duty service members is rising as well, according to military data.

Statistics show a 60% increase of heatstroke or heat exhaustion cases between 2008 and 2018, from 1,766 to 2,792. Over that same stretch of time, at least 17 troops have died from heat-related complications during training exercises on bases in the U.S.

According to the Defense Health Agency, 40% of the heat-related illnesses and deaths since 2014 occurred at five locations: Fort Benning in Georgia, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Camp Lejeune, a Marine Corps installation in North Carolina. Two of the others in the top 10 are in South Carolina.

As the temperatures rise in the U.S. they are rising even faster in regions the military is deployed, like the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. According to some former military members, troops need to train in the heat for exactly these reasons.



""If you want to be prepared for a fight in the heat, you have to train in the heat under the same conditions you'll encounter,"" Augusto Giacoman, a former Army captain, told NBC News.

The military's ""warrior ethos"" also leads to service members pushing past their limits in harsh conditions.

""It doesn't matter that you're about ready to collapse, you don't let on,"" Joy Craig, a retired Marine Corps warrant officer and drill instructor, said. ""You push through it.""

However, in order to get ahead of the problem and prevent death and injury in the future, the military is working toward a number of solutions.

At Fort Benning, Maj. Meghan Galer, who wrote a white-paper on the military and climate change, created a heat center that trains medics how to treat heat illnesses in the field and trains field leaders in prevention tactics. She and her team are also working on a system that monitors vital signs and warns service members if heat stress is imminent.

Military researchers are also developing new uniforms made from lightweight materials and different types of cooling vests, but those could be years away.

Ignorance will Kill Us All: 87 Percent of Americans Unaware There's Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,https://weather.com/science/environment/news/americans-climate-change-scientific-consensus,"NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman tweeted this photo from the International Space Station on Tuesday morning, Sept. 2, 2014. (NASA)

Nearly 90 percent of Americans are unaware that there is a consensus within the scientific community that human-caused climate change is real and threatens the planet, a new report says.

According to the report published last week by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, only 13 percent of Americans were able to correctly identify that more than 90 percent of all climate scientists have concluded that climate change is real.

The annual survey of 1,266 adults compiled in May and June failed to note that it is actually 97 percent of climate scientists that concur that human-caused global warming is happening.

The most common but incorrect response from the survey was that there is a 50 percent consensus among the scientific community that global warming is real and human-caused. One in four responded that they did not know.

Advertisement ""Public misunderstanding of the scientific consensus – which has been found in each of our surveys since 2008 – has significant consequences,"" the researchers note in the Yale-GMU report.

""Other research has identified public understanding of the scientific consensus as an important 'gateway belief' that influences other important beliefs,"" the researchers said, including the beliefs that global warming is happening, is human caused, is a serious problem and is solvable.

Researchers also noted that this lack of understanding hinders support for action.

On the other hand, seven in 10 Americans do believe climate change is happening, which nearly matches the highest level (71 percent) recorded since the survey began 2008. Over half of Americans (58 percent) believe global warming is mostly human-caused — the highest number recorded since the survey began — while 30 percent say it is mostly a natural occurrence."
15 US states now hit by rare inflammatory syndrome impacting children,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-inflammatory-syndrome-children-cuomo-today-us-states-covid-19-a9512851.html,"Health officials are looking into a rare inflammatory syndrome and how it could be impacting children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Now 15 states, including New York, are investigating cases that could be linked to Kawasaki disease ⁠– a rare inflammatory condition that often impacts children aged five years or younger ⁠– and toxic shock syndrome, Governor Andrew Cuomo said during his press briefing on Wednesday.

New York has discovered 102 cases in children that show symptoms similar to the rare disease and are now looking to see if there is a connection with Covid-19.

“We have lost three children in New York because of this. A five-year-old boy, a seven-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl,” Mr Cuomo said. “These cases are all across the state, predominantly where the population is.”

He added that 14 other states and five European countries were also looking into the rare syndrome to see if there was a link to those symptoms and the novel virus.

About 60 per cent of the 102 cases in New York tested positive for the coronavirus. Of those cases, 70 per cent were admitted into the ICU and 19 per cent resulted in intubation.

“Which means it’s serious,” Mr Cuomo added.

The potential link between the coronavirus and these inflammatory syndromes has caused concern among officials because children are presenting symptoms far different from the typical Covid-19 patient. The novel virus often attacks the upper respiratory system, causing a cough or difficulty breathing. But symptoms related to the rare inflammatory disease instead show swelling and redness in the body’s blood vessels.

An estimated 3,000 children are diagnosed with Kawasaki disease in the US each year.

“These are children who come in who don’t present the symptoms that we normally are familiar with with Covid. It’s not a respiratory illness, they’re not in respiratory distress. I think that’s one of the reasons why this may be getting discovered this far into the process,” the governor said last week.

New York hospitals are now required to report to the state health department any children who are showing symptoms mirroring Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome.

The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also asked New York to develop national criteria for other states and hospital systems to assist them in recognising similar patients.

Previously, health officials believed children were largely unaffected by severe symptoms of Covid-19. People aged 60 or over and those with comorbidities are more at risk.

“Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for Covid-19 than adults,” the CDC’s site says. “While some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.”

The department still noted, though, that “severe outcomes have been reported in children, including three deaths”.

“One of the few rays of good news was young people weren’t affected. We’re not so sure that is the fact anymore,” Mr Cuomo added.

Connecticut reported its first case related to the syndrome on Monday. In total, health officials in the state were investigating at least six cases related to the syndrome. New Jersey also announced it was investigating 10 potential cases, none of which were fatal."
"53 million Americans between the ages of 18 to 64—accounting for 44% of all workers—qualify as “low-wage.” Their median hourly wages are $10.22, and median annual earnings are about $18,000.",https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/11/21/low-wage-work-is-more-pervasive-than-you-think-and-there-arent-enough-good-jobs-to-go-around/,"Even as the U.S. economy hums along at a favorable pace, there is a vast segment of workers today earning wages low enough to leave their livelihood and families extremely vulnerable. That’s one of the main takeaways from our new analysis, in which we found that 53 million Americans between the ages of 18 to 64—accounting for 44% of all workers—qualify as “low-wage.” Their median hourly wages are $10.22, and median annual earnings are about $18,000. (See the methods section of our paper to learn about how we identify low-wage workers.)

The existence of low-wage work is hardly a surprise, but most people—except, perhaps, low-wage workers themselves—underestimate how prevalent it is. Many also misunderstand who these workers are. They are not only students, people at the beginning of their careers, or people who need extra spending money. A majority are adults in their prime working years, and low-wage work is the primary way they support themselves and their families.

Low-wage work is a source of economic vulnerability

There are two central questions when considering the prospects of low-wage workers:

Is the job a springboard or a dead end? Does the job provide supplemental, “nice to have” income, or is it critical to covering basic living expenses?

We didn’t analyze the first question directly, but other research is not encouraging, finding that while some workers move on from low-wage work to higher-paying jobs, many do not. Women, people of color, and those with low levels of education are the most likely to stay in low-wage jobs. In our analysis, over half of low-wage workers have levels of education suggesting they will stay low-wage workers. This includes 20 million workers ages 25-64 with a high school diploma or less, and another seven million young adults 18-24 who are not in school and do not have a college degree.

As to the second question, a few data points show that for millions of workers, low-wage work is a primary source of financial support—which leaves these families economically vulnerable.

Measured by poverty status: 30% of low-wage workers (16 million people) live in families earning below 150% of the poverty line. These workers get by on very low incomes: about $30,000 for a family of three and $36,000 for a family of four.

Measured by the presence or absence of other earners: 26% of low-wage workers (14 million people) are the only earners in their families, getting by on median annual earnings of about $20,000. Another 25% (13 million people) live in families in which all workers earn low wages, with median family earnings of about $42,000. These 27 million low-wage workers rely on their earnings to provide for themselves and their families, as they are either the family’s primary earner or a substantial contributor to total earnings. Their earnings are unlikely to represent “nice to have” supplemental income.

The low-wage workforce is part of every regional economy

We analyzed data for nearly 400 metropolitan areas, and the share of workers in a particular place earning low wages ranges from a low of 30% to a high of 62%. The relative size of the low-wage population in a given place relates to broader labor market conditions such as the strength of the regional labor market and industry composition.

Low-wage workers make up the highest share of the workforce in smaller places in the southern and western parts of the United States, including Las Cruces, N.M. and Jacksonville, N.C. (both 62%); Visalia, Calif. (58%); Yuma, Ariz. (57%); and McAllen, Texas (56%). These and other metro areas where low-wage workers account for high shares of the workforce are places with lower employment rates that concentrate in agriculture, real estate, and hospitality.

No region wants an economy dominated by low-wage jobs. The economic development challenge in these places is clear (which is not to say it is easy): attract and grow more high-wage jobs by drawing new companies in and helping existing companies grow and increase their productivity. Indeed, recent rounds of research and policy analysis focus on helping these types of “left behind” places.

But metro areas where low-wage workers make up relatively lower shares of the workforce also have much to do. It does not take away from the urgency of addressing the regional prosperity divide to note that superstar regions leave many of their own people behind. Places with some of the highest wages and most productive economies are home to large numbers of low-wage workers: nearly one million in the Washington, D.C. region, 700,000 each in Boston and San Francisco, and 560,000 in Seattle. Addressing the challenge of low wages combined with high housing prices is a key issue in these places.

For more people to escape low-wage work, we need to create more jobs paying higher wages

Discussions about improving outcomes for low-wage workers often center on worker skills and abilities.

We already know a great deal about how to expand and improve education and training options, although—again—that is not to say it is easy. (See here for the education-focused recommendations in our report.) We need additional funds, a commitment to change the status quo, political will to reallocate funding toward evidence-based programs, and greater employer involvement.

But the conversation can’t end with the assumption that if only workers had more skills, everything would be fine. The success of any job seeker depends not only on his or her skills, but on the strength of the economy, the credentials and experience that employers look for, and the number and types of jobs available.

What kinds of jobs are we generating, do they pay enough to live on, and to whom are they available? Recent analysis by our Metropolitan Policy Program colleagues as well as researchers at the Federal Reserve suggest that there simply are not enough jobs paying decent wages for people without college degrees (who make up the majority of the labor force) to escape low-wage work.

Our colleagues Chad Shearer and Isha Shah identified good jobs for workers without bachelor’s degrees by defining “good jobs” as those paying median earnings or more for a given metropolitan area and providing health insurance. They found that such jobs are relatively scarce, held by only 20% of workers without bachelor’s degrees in large metro areas. Another 13% are in “promising” jobs, in which incumbent workers are likely to progress to a good job within 10 years.

An analysis by Kyle Fee, Keith Wardrip, and Lisa Nelson came to similar findings. They defined good jobs for workers without a bachelor’s degree as those paying at least the national median wage adjusted for local cost of living. The analysis found that for every good job there are 3.4 working-age adults with less than a bachelor’s degree.

Education on its own cannot solve this problem. Imagine that all working-age adults had bachelor’s degrees—the jobs paying low wages would not disappear, nor would wages automatically increase. Dani Rodrik and Charles Sabel capture the urgency and uncertainty of the current discourse on jobs and economic growth when they write, “’Where will the good jobs come from?’ is perhaps the defining question of our contemporary political economy.”

They argue, as do many others (for example, see here, here, and here), that we need new approaches to promote upward economic mobility, and to rethink some of the fundamentals undergirding social and economic policy. As our colleague Amy Liu has posited, the goal of economic development should be to support growth that is shared and enduring, increase the productivity of firms and workers, and raise standards of living for all.

The data presented in this analysis highlight the scale of the issue: Nearly half of all workers earn wages that are not enough, on their own, to promote economic security. As policymakers and leaders of the private, social, and civic sectors seek to promote more inclusive economic growth, they need to keep these workers in mind."
CBS News: The COVID-19 pandemic has left the world facing an unprecedented hunger crisis.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunger-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic/,"It's Friday morning in Alexandra township – a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg – and dozens of people are gathered in a field outside a food distribution point, hoping today might be the day they get something to eat.

""If you're hungry, it's easy to get sick from stress and everything,"" says Mduduzi Khumalo, who's been lining up every day for two weeks. To get food your name has to be on the list and, so far, despite registering multiple times, his hasn't been.

Khumalo worked as a delivery man before South Africa's coronavirus lockdown decimated his income. His children used to get two meals a day at school, but schools are closed now. Every day, the kids wait for him at the family's tiny home, and every day brings the same bad news.

""They know that if I don't get anything for them, it's over,"" Khumalo tells CBS News.

Famines ""of biblical proportions""

The coronavirus pandemic has left the world facing an unprecedented hunger crisis. The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has warned that by the end of the year, more than 260 million people will face starvation – double last year's figures.

""In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries,"" warned WFP director David Beasley. He said the world could face multiple famines ""of biblical proportions within a few short months.""

Oil prices have collapsed, tourism is drying up, and overseas remittances – foreign workers transferring money to their families in other countries – on which many people depend for survival, are expected to decline sharply.

There's ""a real danger that more people could potentially die from the economic impact of COVID-19 than from the virus itself,"" Beasley said.

Sub-Saharan Africa particularly at risk

If global GDP declines by 5% because of the pandemic, another 147 million people could be plunged into extreme poverty, according to estimates by the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.

More than half of those people – 79 million – live in sub-Saharan Africa, David Laborde Debucquet, a senior research fellow at IFPRI, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Another 42 million are in South Asia, he said.

""We are talking about (people) earning below $1.90 a day... where basically your life is in danger because, when you have this type of poverty and you cannot eat, you will die,"" Debucquet told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""This will affect the urban poor much more. In the last couple of decades, we have seen very fast urbanization in these two regions.""

""I'm afraid of getting sick, and I'm afraid of starving.""

Thandi Lebho, 39, lives in the South African township of Diepsloot. She and her husband and three children have been waiting for food donations for three weeks. They haven't been able to get what they need since South Africa's lockdown began and her income from selling tupperware containers dried up.

""I've registered online and by phone, and I write on the papers from the street, and I came here at the clinic and registered, but nothing happened,"" she tells CBS News. When she manages to get to the food distribution truck, it's already run out of supplies.

""The kids are not going to school and education is going low. We are struggling to get money because I'm working for myself. I'm self-employed – so my business is in my house – so I'm not earning anything now,"" she says. ""I'm starving now. I don't have anything.""

She'll be back in the food line tomorrow, trying to get something to keep her family going.

""I'm afraid of getting sick, and I'm afraid of starving,"" she says."
"Record-Breaking Warm Weather Expected Around Globe As Human-Caused Climate Crisis Now As Powerful As El Niño's Effects, Says WMO",https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/02/record-breaking-warm-weather-expected-around-globe-human-caused-climate-crisis-now,"As countries accustomed to cold, snowy winters reported record-breaking warm weather this season, meteorological experts on Monday predicted that temperatures over the next several months will also be warmer than usual—even without the effects of El Niño.

In its El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) update, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said that the naturally-occurring El Niño phenomenon has only a 20 to 35% chance of taking place between March and August 2020. Warm weather mirroring El Niño's effects, however, is 55 to 60% likely over that same time period.

Above average temperatures are expected in many parts of the globe in the next few months, even without the presence of a warming #ENiño, according to new WMO Update.

""Even ENSO neutral months are warmer than in the past, as air and sea surface temperatures and ocean heat have increased due to climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a statement. ""The signal from human-induced climate change is now as powerful as that from a major natural force of nature.""

El Niño, which involves changes in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures and in the ""overlying atmospheric circulation,"" as the WMO wrote, is associated with drought, rain, and other weather events associated with warmer temperatures.

Even without the phenomenon, above-average sea surface temperatures are expected in both tropical and non-tropical regions in the next several months, which will lead to unusually warm weather on land as well.

The WMO report came as officials from around the world reported that cities and countries in a number of regions are experiencing unusually warm winters.

Moscow has had its warmest winter season in 200 years of record-keeping, with an average temperature of 32.3 degrees Fahrenheit—the first winter the city has experienced with an average temperature above freezing. Data is still being recorded throughout Russia, the Washington Post reported, and the entire country may have set a warm-weather record this winter.

Japan and France have also recorded their warmest winters.

The mental health crisis among America’s youth is real – and staggering,https://theconversation.com/the-mental-health-crisis-among-americas-youth-is-real-and-staggering-113239,"The first signs of a problem started to emerge around 2014: More young people said they felt overwhelmed and depressed. College counseling centers reported sharp increases in the number of students seeking treatment for mental health issues.

Even as studies were showing increases in symptoms of depression and in suicide among adolescents since 2010, some researchers called the concerns overblown and claimed there simply isn’t enough good data to reach that conclusion.

The idea that there’s an epidemic in anxiety or depression among youth “is simply a myth,” psychiatrist Richard Friedman wrote in The New York Times last year. Others suggested young people were simply more willing to get help when they needed it. Or perhaps counseling centers’ outreach efforts were becoming more effective.

But a new analysis of a large representative survey reinforces what I – and others – have been saying: The epidemic is all too real. In fact, the increase in mental health issues among teens and young adults is nothing short of staggering.

An epidemic of anguish

One of the best ways to find out if mental health issues have increased is to talk to a representative sample of the general population, not just those who seek help. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has done just that.

It surveyed over 600,000 Americans. Recent trends are startling.

From 2009 to 2017, major depression among 20- to 21-year-olds more than doubled, rising from 7 percent to 15 percent. Depression surged 69 percent among 16- to 17-year-olds. Serious psychological distress, which includes feelings of anxiety and hopelessness, jumped 71 percent among 18- to 25-year-olds from 2008 to 2017. Twice as many 22- to 23-year-olds attempted suicide in 2017 compared with 2008, and 55 percent more had suicidal thoughts. The increases were more pronounced among girls and young women. By 2017, one out of five 12- to 17-year-old girls had experienced major depression in the previous year.

Is it possible that young people simply became more willing to admit to mental health problems? My co-authors and I tried to address this possibility by analyzing data on actual suicide rates collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suicide is a behavior, so changes in suicide rates can’t be caused by more willingness to admit to issues.

Tragically, suicide also jumped during the period. For example, the suicide rate among 18- to 19-year-olds climbed 56 percent from 2008 to 2017. Other behaviors related to depression have also increased, including emergency department admissions for self-harm, such as cutting, as well as hospital admissions for suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts.

The large increases in mental health issues in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health appeared almost exclusively among teens and young adults, with less change among Americans ages 26 and over. Even after statistically controlling for the influences of age and year, we found that depression, distress and suicidal thoughts were much higher among those born in the mid- to late-1990s, the generation I call iGen.

The mental health crisis seems to be a generational issue, not something that affects Americans of all ages. And that, more than anything else, might help researchers figure out why it’s happening.

The shift in social life

It’s always difficult to determine the causes behind trends, but some possibilities seem less likely than others.

A troubled economy and job loss, two typical culprits of mental stress, don’t appear to be to blame. That’s because U.S. economic growth was strong and the unemployment rate dropped significantly from 2011 to 2017, when mental health issues were rising the most.

It’s unlikely that academic pressure was the cause, as iGen teens spent less time on homework on average than teens did in the 1990s.

Although the increase in mental health issues occurred around the same time as the opioid epidemic, that crisis seemed to almost exclusively affect adults older than 25.

But there was one societal shift over the past decade that influenced the lives of today’s teens and young adults more than any other generation: the spread of smartphones and digital media like social media, texting and gaming.

While older people use these technologies as well, younger people adopted them more quickly and completely, and the impact on their social lives was more pronounced. In fact, it has drastically restructured their daily lives.

Compared with their predecessors, teens today spend less time with their friends in person and more time communicating electronically, which study after study has found is associated with mental health issues.

No matter the cause, the rise in mental health issues among teens and young adults deserves attention, not a dismissal as a “myth.” With more young people suffering – including more attempting suicide and more taking their own lives – the mental health crisis among American young people can no longer be ignored."
"Because of the climate-induced soil salinity, the rice harvest is likely to decline by 15.6% in nine coastal unions, where the soil salinity will exceed around four decimals per meter by 2050.",http://www.zulkernaeen.com/exclusive-report/climate-salinity-coastal-bd/,"A new study says the health of mangrove trees of the Sundarbans has significantly declined over the last 30 years due to salinity increase.

Sharing is caring!

Climate change is a key reason to increase river salinity leading to shortages of drinking water and irrigation. It is bringing a substantial difference in the aquatic ecosystems in the coastal areas of Bangladesh.

In the coastal areas of Bangladesh, salinity intrusion in soil may lead to a deteriorating yield by 15.6% of high-harvesting-variety rice and reduce the income of farmers expressively.

In the background of climate change, we know, the coastal population is more exposed to saltwater intrusion. These populations on the “frontline” of climate change because of the constant sea-level rise beyond 2100, even if greenhouse gas emissions remain stable today.

Therefore, Bangladesh must comprehend the potential impacts and begin planning to cope with them.

However, most research has focused on the long-run effects of the sea level rise and associated losses from heightened cyclone-induced surges.

So, we need to investigate the level of higher salinity from saltwater intrusion, and its impact on livelihoods and adaptation alternatives.

To look more closely at the impacts of climate change on saltwater intrusion, the World Bank researched on the coastal region of Bangladesh.

Already, they found the coastal area is facing problems from salinization. And, the situation is deteriorating.

Climate Change and River salinity in coastal areas.

Climate change causes substantial changes in river salinity. Accordingly, it leads to the crisis of drinking water as well as the shortage of irrigation water.

Shortly, the changes in river salinity will unpleasantly affect the productivity of many capture fisheries. Negatively, it will affect the wild habitats of freshwater fish and giant prawns.

The health of Mangrove trees is declining.

A new study says the health of mangrove trees of the Sundarbans has significantly declined over the last 30 years due to salinity increase.

Consequently, the decline in health could critically hamper the ability to spring back. It makes it prone to unexpected climate-related hazards.

Also, the salinity increase in the water may induce a shift in the Sunderbans mangrove forest from Sundari to Gewa and Guran.

Accordingly, Bagerhat, Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Khulna, Jhalokati, Pirojpur, and Satkhira districts will be most adversely affected.

Climate Change, Soil Salinity in Coastal

Bangladesh.

Soon, the salinity level in the soil will surge in many areas of Barisal, Chittagong, and Khulna districts significantly. A study on the soil of the coastal regions of Bangladesh, the Soil Research Development Institute projects a median increase of 26% in salinity by 2050, with increases over 55% in the most affected areas.

Impacts on rice production due to climate change.

Accordingly, the climate-induced soil salinity is impacting on the output of high-harvesting-variety rice. As a result, the rice harvest is likely to decline by 15.6% in nine coastal unions, where the soil salinity will exceed around four decisions per meter by 2050.

Now, the farmers are earning less from rice production in several regions, along with the losses of 10.5% Barisal and 7.5 in Chittagong, earlier.

Consequently, many unions are suffering from significant yield losses and substantial price reductions from rising salinity.

Livelihoods are in threat in a changing climate .

Already, the salinity has turned the household status to the most harmful level. The poverty impact is striking one that the economic situation of a coastal household is in the bottom 20% rises six-fold, from 8% to 56%.

Therefore, the Bangladesh government is trying to cope up with the adverse effects of a changing climate. As we know, the country is one of the frontiers which is affected by climate change.

"The 11,000 scientists who declare a climate emergency are also strongly endorsing POPULATION REDUCTION",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7651915/Worldwide-consortium-11-000-scientists-declare-climate-EMERGENCY-predict-untold-suffering.html,"Thousands of the world's greatest scientists have joined together to declare that 'untold human suffering' is unavoidable without deep and lasting shifts in human activities.

An alliance of more than 11,000 scientists signed the paper which declared the climate emergency before providing a set of effective actions humans could take.

To limit the damage caused by humans' greenhouse gas emissions the paper calls for more control over the massively booming global population, currently increasing by over 200,000 people a day.

Adding that population control would have to be approached with methods that ensured social and economic justice in order to sustain a morally and ecologically sound world.

The global group is led by William J. Ripple professor of ecology at Oregon State University and researcher Christopher Wolf.

Professor Ripple said: 'Despite 40 years of major global negotiations, we have continued to conduct business as usual and have failed to address this crisis.

'Climate change has arrived and is accelerating faster than many scientists expected.'

The paper pointed to six areas in which humanity should take immediate steps to slow down the effects of a warming planet.

Firstly reducing the consumption of energy and replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon renewables - leaving remaining stocks of fossil fuels in the ground.

William J. Ripple professor of ecology at Oregon State University

They detail how this can be encouraged by eliminating subsidies to fossil fuel companies and imposing carbon fees that are high enough to restrain the use of fossil fuels.

Secondly the paper called for the reduction of 'short-lived pollutants' such as methane, soot and hydroflourocarbons to be drastically cut - calculating that the reduction could see the short-term warming trend cut 50 per cent over the next few decades.

The paper also suggests ecosystems such as forests, grasslands and mangroves are protected in order for them to reach 'ecological potential' and act as carbon dioxide converters - a prevalent green house gas created by human activity.

Humans are encouraged to adopt a diet with fewer animal products by the researchers.

The dietary shift would significantly reduce emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases and free up agricultural lands for growing human food rather than livestock feed.

Reducing food waste is also stated as critical - the scientists say at least one-third of all food produced ends up as garbage, meaning unnecessary emissions were created in producing it.

Scientists call for a 'carbon free' economy, shifting goals away from the growth of gross domestic product and the pursuit of extreme wealth.

Instead humans should realise their 'dependence on the biosphere' and put that first, curbing the exploitation of ecosystems, writes the paper.

Finally the paper states that the growing rate of human population needs to slow in order to sustain an ecologically sound world.

WHAT STEPS CAN WE TAKE TO LIMIT CLIMATE CHANGE? Steps detailed in the paper written by William J. Ripple professor of ecology at Oregon State University and researcher Christopher Wolf. 1) Replace fossil fuels with low-carbon renewables 2) Swiftly cut emissions of methane, soot, hydrofluorocarbons and other short-lived climate pollutants 3) Restore and protect ecosystems to allow them to naturally convert CO2 emissions 4) Shift world's diet to plant based and reduce food waste 5) Shift economic goals towards maintaining biosphere - not gaining wealth 6) Stabilise global human population Advertisement

They add that population control would have to be approached with methods that ensured social and economic justice.

The paper was published today in BioScience and held more than 11,000 scientist signatories from 153 countries.

In conclusion the paper states: 'Mitigating and adapting to climate change while honoring the diversity of humans entails major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems.

'We are encouraged by a recent surge of concern. Governmental bodies are making climate emergency declarations. Schoolchildren are striking. Ecocide lawsuits are proceeding in the courts. Grassroots citizen movements are demanding change, and many countries, states and provinces, cities, and businesses are responding.

'As an Alliance of World Scientists, we stand ready to assist decision makers in a just transition to a sustainable and equitable future.'

Graphs of vital signs in the paper illustrate several key climate-change indicators and factors over the last 40 years, since scientists from 50 nations met at the First World Climate Conference in Geneva in 1979.

In recent decades, multiple other global assemblies have agreed that urgent action is essential, but greenhouse gas emissions are still rapidly rising.

Other ominous signs from human activities include sustained increases in per-capita meat production, global tree cover loss and number of airline passengers.

There are also some encouraging signs - including decreases in global birth rates and decelerated forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, and increases in wind and solar power - but even those measures are tinged with worry.

The decline in birth rates has slowed over the last 20 years, for example, and the pace of Amazon forest loss appears to be starting to increase again.

Professor Ripple added: 'Global surface temperature, ocean heat content, extreme weather and its costs, sea level, ocean acidity, and area burned in the United States are all rising.

'Globally, ice is rapidly disappearing as demonstrated by decreases in minimum summer Arctic sea ice, Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and glacier thickness. All of these rapid changes highlight the urgent need for action.'"
Most Americans expect life to get worse by 2050,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/04/08/most-americans-expect-life-to-get-worse-by-2050?fsrc=scn%2Ftw%2Fte%2Fbl%2Fed%2Fauto,"A NEW study by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, has found that although a majority of Americans are generally upbeat about the country’s long-term outlook, most of them make gloomy forecasts when questioned about specific policies. Pew began its poll of 2,500 adults by asking them to think broadly about the future of America in 30 years’ time. Some 56% of them described themselves as optimistic about that prospect.

Yet that figure might simply reflect Americans’ patriotism, since Pew asked them to evaluate the country as a whole. Most struggled to identify any aspect of life that they thought would improve save, perhaps, for race relations. A clear majority believed that public education would get worse, health care would grow less affordable and the political climate would become more divisive. Three-fifths thought that by 2050 America would probably suffer another terrorist attack as bad as that on September 11th 2001. Their economic predictions were particularly gloomy. Only 20% of respondents reckoned that living standards in 2050 would be substantially higher than today. Some 73% thought that the gap between rich Americans and poor ones would get wider.

Are Americans right to be so gloomy? Steven Pinker, a psychologist, has documented how human assessments of society are skewed by negativity bias. Because headlines about bad news are more attention-grabbing, people often assume that the world is going to hell in a handbasket, even as their personal quality of life continues to improve. “Enlightenment Now”, Mr Pinker’s latest book, is an encyclopedia of the various ways in which living standards have increased in recent decades around the world, not least in America.

The income of the median household, after adjusting for inflation and changes in taxation and benefits, did stagnate between 2006 and 2013. However, it grew strongly for several decades before this period, and has also picked up again in the last few years as the economy has gained steam. Nonetheless, there are some signs that Americans’ general quality of life is no longer rapidly improving. The spread of opioid addiction has caused life expectancy to fall for three consecutive years. Since 2014 America has slipped from 20th to 25th in the Social Progress Index, a measure of living standards that ignores economic performance. It is the only rich country to have seen its overall score decrease in that time, owing largely to declining ratings for health care and social inequality.

The country has also seen a fall in self-reported happiness during the past decade. There is still plenty for Americans to be thankful for—but some of their fears about the future are not entirely unfounded."
Unemployment filing failures: New survey confirms that millions of jobless were unable to file an unemployment insurance claim,https://www.epi.org/blog/unemployment-filing-failures-new-survey-confirms-that-millions-of-jobless-were-unable-to-file-an-unemployment-insurance-claim/,"New survey confirms that millions of jobless were unable to file an unemployment insurance claim

Millions of the newly jobless are going without benefits as the unemployment system buckles under the weight of new claims, according to our new national survey, conducted in mid-April.

For every 10 people who said they successfully filed for unemployment benefits during the previous four weeks:

Three to four additional people tried to apply but could not get through the system to make a claim.

Two additional people did not try to apply because it was too difficult to do so.

These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions and the need for economic relief during the coronavirus crisis. To quantify the undercount, we look at the 21.5 million workers who filed for unemployment benefits from March 22 to April 18. Our results suggest:

An additional 7.8 to 12.2 million people could have filed for benefits had the process been easier.

After accounting for these workers—who applied but could not get through or did not try because of the difficult process—about half of potential UI applicants are actually receiving benefits.

When we extrapolate our survey findings to the full five weeks of UI claims since March 15, we estimate that an additional 8.9–13.9 million people could have filed for benefits had the process been easier.

These findings on the millions of frustrated filers and the UI system’s low payment rate highlight the need for policies to improve rather than hinder the UI application process. At a minimum, states should presume everyone is eligible and immediately pay benefits, only verifying eligibility and reviewing claims after the unprecedented wave of claims slows down.

Quantifying reports of frustrated filers for unemployment

An estimated 24.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits from March 15 through April 18. But while the CARES Act significantly expanded workers’ UI eligibility and benefits during the coronavirus crisis, widespread reports indicate that long-neglected state UI systems are unable to handle the volume of applications, preventing laid-off or furloughed workers from receiving necessary unemployment benefits. To gauge how well the UI system is handling the new caseloads, we used Google Surveys to ask 25,000 people, “Did you apply for unemployment benefits in the last 4 weeks?” (Google Surveys collects responses from visitors to news and other internet sites; see Google Survey’s description for more details and see the paper by Brynjolfsson et al. for an application of Google Survey data to measure the prevalence of remote work during the pandemic.) From April 14 to April 24, 24,607 respondents (98%) answered the survey.

To our knowledge, ours is the one of the first national surveys that asks about the social safety net and its performance in the COVID-19 era. In the process of writing this draft, we became aware of another survey, conducted by Navigator and Global Strategy Group April 17–22, that asked 1,022 registered voters about their experience and difficulty with accessing unemployment benefits. In addition, a survey conducted by Bick and Blanden April 22–23 found that many respondents have yet to apply for UI benefits.

Figure A shows the shares of people who responded each of the six answers to the question, “Did you apply for unemployment benefits in the last 4 weeks?” (respondents could select one of the six).

Figure A ‘Did you apply for unemployment benefits in the last 4 weeks?’ : Share of survey participants, by response Survey Question Rate of responses I applied successfully 9.4% I tried but I could not get through 3.4% I tried but my application was rejected 1.6% I did not apply because it was too difficult 1.9% I did not apply because I am not eligible 15.2 I did not apply because I did not lose a job 68.5% Chart Data Download data The data below can be saved or copied directly into Excel.

The 9.4% of survey respondents who said they “applied successfully” for benefits is reassuringly similar to what one would expect based on official UI claims data over a similar time frame. According to Google Surveys, the survey population is balanced to represent the age 18 and older internet-using population of the U.S., or about 254.7 million people according to the latest 2019 Census population estimates. The survey results therefore imply there were about 23.8 million UI claims applications. For comparison, total initial UI claims reported to the U.S. Department of Labor from March 22 to April 18 were only somewhat lower, at about 21.5 million. It makes sense that our survey-based estimate is slightly higher because of the backlog and delays of UI claim determination. Moreover, to the extent that we are overstating the rate of successful applications, we are necessarily understating the rate of unsuccessful attempts to apply for benefits.

The 3.4% share of respondents who tried to apply but could not get through the system represents a clear lower bound on those frustrated by the process and prevented from applying. (If states improve the processing of UI claims, some of these frustrated filers may eventually be able to apply and have their applications accepted.)

To put this number in perspective, if we conservatively equate the 9.4% of the respondents who applied successfully with the total 21.5 million initial UI claims filed over the four weeks ending April 18, then 7.8 million tried to apply and couldn’t get through. Similarly, if we add to this 7.8 million the 1.9% of respondents who did not apply because it was too difficult, a total of 12.2 million people would be UI claimants but were not.

All told, additional 7.8 to 12.2 million people could have applied for benefits had the process been easier. This estimate is conservative, because some of the 1.6% of respondents (3.7 million people) who tried to apply but were rejected may have had their applications rejected because states were unable to process applicants with expanded eligibility under the CARES Act, such as newly covered self-employed workers. When we extrapolate our survey findings to the full five weeks of UI claims since March 15, we estimate that 8.9–13.9 million people could have filed for benefits had the process been easier.

From other research on official UI claims data, we know that only 71% of UI applicants are receiving benefits, in that their initial claims have become continuing insured claims. But this calculation excludes those prevented from applying in the first place. Accounting for the 7.8 to 12.2 million people who could have applied, we estimate that the UI system’s payment rate could be as low as 45% to 52%.

In order to put the “frustrated filers” into perspective, it is helpful to compare them to the number of people who said they applied successfully. Figure B shows the results. For every 10 successful UI applicants, three to four more people tried but couldn’t get through, and two people did not apply because it was too difficult.

Technical details about the survey

We conducted a single-question survey targeted at 25,000 respondents through Google Surveys, beginning April 14. The survey was about 98% complete and had 24,607 respondents as of April 24; the results in this blog post use that data. Google Surveys attempts to make the population representative of the age 18 and older internet-using population, balancing demographics to match the national population sample from the U.S. Census Current Population Survey Computer and Internet Use Supplement; see here for more details.

Our single question survey asked “Did you apply for unemployment benefits in the last 4 weeks?” Respondents could select only one of six answers, which were presented in this order:

I did not apply because I did not lose a job

I did not apply because I am not eligible

I did not apply because it was too difficult

I tried but my application was rejected

I tried but I could not get through

I applied successfully

Using inferred demographics from respondents’ search histories, Google Surveys assigns sample weights to about three-quarters of the sample. In order to use the entire sample of respondents, we presented unweighted results. Table 1 shows the survey results are very similar with or without sample weights.

Two million in Zimbabwe's capital have no water as city turns off taps,https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/07/15/two-million-zimbabwes-capital-no-water-city-turns-off-taps/,"‘The situation is bad, period’, says spokesman for Harare council, as suburbs go weeks without water and cases of typhoid are reported

By Sophie Mbugua

More than two million residents around Zimbabwe’s capital have no access to running water, as drought and breakdowns push the city system to collapse.



Just 50% of 4.5 million people in Harare and four satellite towns currently have access to the municipal water supply, the city authority told Climate Home News.

“There is a rotational water supply within the five towns,” Harare city council corporate communications manager Michael Chideme said. “Some people are getting water five days a week especially in the western suburbs, but the northern suburbs are going for weeks without a drop in their taps.”

Chideme said people were either depending on water merchants, open wells, streams or several council-drilled boreholes. “The situation is bad, period!”

Dr Jean-Marie Kileshye from WaterNet warned Harare’s water was highly polluted: “Water-borne diseases linked to these boreholes are on the rise, but people have had to take in their own hands water supply because the utility has failed to provide water.”

Hardlife Mudzingwa, of Harare’s Community Water Alliance, said 10 typhoid cases were reported during the first week of July in the southwestern suburb of Glen View.

Cities around the world are facing increased water stress. Last week, the Indian city of Chennai began using trains to ferry in emergency supplies after rains failed. In 2018, Cape Town in South Africa avoided a city-wide water network shutdown by just a few months.

Zimbabwe is getting warmer as the climate changes and heavy rains and droughts are becoming more intense. In Harare, rains are expected in October at earliest, according to James Ngoma of the Zimbabwe Meteorological Services Department.

In 2018, a drought warning was issued to Zimbabwe by the Southern Africa Development Community. But those messages were not getting through, said Brad Garanganga, a climate scientist from Zimbabwe. Under-resourced meteorological departments had not been able to help policy makers “make decisions to take action on this type of important information ahead of time rather than wait until a crisis hit”.

Harare obtains raw water from four dams: Harava, Seke, Chivero and Manyame. Harava and Seke are completely dry. This has led Harare city council to decommission the Prince Edward water treatment plant, which is fed by those dams.

This has left only one water treatment works – Morton Jaffray – supplying water to Harare and the four other satellite towns.

The dams that feed Morton Jaffray – Chivero and Manyame – are larger and closer to capacity, said Harare mayor Herbert Gomba. But they are “heavily polluted”, requiring more than 10 chemicals to purify. Upstream towns dump domestic, sewage, agricultural and mining waste into the rivers that feed the capital’s dams. The city is spending $3 million a month on water treatment chemicals, Gomba said, forcing it to restrict the amount released.

Harare’s daily demand is around 1,200 million litres (Ml). Gomba told CHN the city was producing around 450Ml a day. Last month, Harare City Council recommended the water situation be declared a national emergency.

Community organiser Mudzingwa said he believed the city supplies to be less than 100Ml/day. Companies that packaged and sold bottled water to supermarkets and hotels were still receiving municipal supplies, while residents saw their taps turned off, he claimed.

Harare’s water system was designed to service a population of 350,000 people, said Kileshye. The last upgrade was in 1994, but the country has since been in near-constant economic crisis. The city council’s website says some sections of infrastructure have been in use for more than 60 years, “way beyond their economic life of at least 15 years”.

With this in mind, in 2011, the Zimbabwean government signed a loan of $144m from the China Export-Import (Exim) Bank to upgrade its water infrastructure.

The government has accessed $72m, according to Gomba, with which the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was rehabilitated. But five distribution centres and two sewage treatment plants were yet to rehabilitated.

Mudzingwa raised questions over how the other half of the loan was administered, saying: “A 2014 internal audit report produced by City of Harare showed that there was inflating of quotations on materials that were bought through the loan. Corruption marred the water project with commodities overpriced, hence the government was not able to access the full amount.”

Gomba rejected corruption allegations. “We never received liquid money, but equipment procured from China. It was due to the government’s inability to honour previous loans following the economic crisis that hindered access to the balance, not corruption.”

The mayor added that non-payment of residential and commercial rates was hampering his administration from effectively delivering water. Even after rehabilitation, he warned supplies from Prince Edward and Morton Jaffray works would reach only 770Ml per day, leaving a shortfall of 430Ml.

“We have to construct three new dams, to add about 840 million cubic metres. But over time Harare has to decommission the old dams and allow them time to rehabilitate naturally,” said the mayor.

Map: Two of Harare’s four reservoirs, Chivero and Manyame, seen to the west of the city, are heavily polluted.

In 2016, the Zimbabwean government signed a contract with a Chinese contractor Sinohydro to construct a dam northeast of the capital Harare. Mudzingwa said construction of Kunzvi-Musami Dam – 67 km outside Harare – was estimated to cost $850-900 million. But the project was not new.

“The discussion on the construction Kunzvi-Musami Dam as an alternative water source started as early as 1990 but is still not ready,” he said. “The central and local government have failed us on water supply.”

Mudzingwa agreed an urgent infrastructure upgrade was needed to solve the water challenges in Harare but he stressed the need for budget transparency. “We must also ensure citizens are involved actively in water governance framework and smart coordination between water sectors,” he said.

Council spokesperson Chideme said the city was running education programmes for citizens, “to minimize pollution of available water resources and while effectively using the available water sparingly so that we do not run out of water”.

“Technology by itself will not be good enough,” said WaterNet’s Kileshye. “The people across the whole spectrum from households, industries need to be made aware that they are part of the solution to sustainable water in cities.”

"Saudi Arabia is shutting down half of its oil production after drone attack, WSJ says",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/14/saudi-arabia-is-shutting-down-half-of-its-oil-production-after-drone-attack-wsj-says.html,"Saudi Arabia shut down half its oil production Saturday after a series of drone strikes hit the world's largest oil processing facility in an attack claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels.

The closure will impact almost 5.7 million barrels of crude production a day, about 5% of the world's daily oil production, according to Saudi Aramco. In August, Saudi Arabia produced 9.85 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the attacks also led to a halt in gas production that will reduce the supply of ethane and natural gas liquids by 50%.

Saudi Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser said nobody was hurt in the attacks and emergency crews have contained the fires and brought the situation under control.

""Work is underway to restore production and a progress update will be provided in around 48 hours,"" Nasser said.

Early Saturday, the Khurais oilfield operated by Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, and the Abqaiq oil processing facility were attacked by a number of drones. The facility at Abqaiq is crucial for global energy supplies.

Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was one of their largest attacks ever inside the kingdom.

""We promise the Saudi regime that our future operations will expand and be more painful as long as its aggression and siege continue,"" a Houthi spokesman said. The attack deployed 10 drones, the Houthis said.



But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for the attacks.

""Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,"" Pompeo wrote on Twitter. ""Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""

The White House said President Donald Trump spoke with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to offer U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's defense.

""Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust. The United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied,"" the White House said.

The Saudi interior ministry said investigations into the terrorist attack are ongoing.

Saudi Energy Minister Salman said the kingdom will compensate part of the production to its customers from its reserves.

""This is a big deal,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. ""Fearing the worst, I expect that the market will open up $5 to $10 per barrel on Sunday evening. This is 12 to 25 cents per gallon for gasoline.""

Lipow noted over four million barrels per day of Saudi oil exports go to Asia, while the U.S. imports about 600,000 barrels. The biggest importers in Asia are China at 1.3 million barrels and Japan at 1.2 million barrels.

The International Energy Agency said Saturday it is ""closely monitoring"" the situation following the drone attacks, adding markets are ""well supplied with ample commercial stocks.""

The Houthis have been behind a series of attacks on Saudi pipelines, tankers and other infrastructure in the past few years as tensions rise among Iran and the U.S. and its partners like Saudi Arabia.

The Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, has recently attacked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.

The latest attack came as Saudi Arabia moves forward to take Saudi Aramco public in a major shakeup of the kingdom's energy sector. The world's most profitable oil company is expected to be valued at more than $1.5 trillion, CNBC previously reported. Crown Prince Salman has pushed for a valuation of as much as $2 trillion.

UK: Much of the food you and I will be eating next week hasn’t even arrived in the country yet: hardly the sort of system to withstand a sudden crisis.,https://www.notechmagazine.com/2019/10/food-security-in-the-west.html,"“It might seem alarmist, even tasteless, to mention food security in the West when we appear to be enjoying the greatest era of abundance in history. Food security is something we tend to associate with the developing world, and considering how many people worldwide face starvation every day, worrying about our own food supply seems almost obscene… On the face of it, the modern food industry seems to have solved the problem of food supply. Far from waiting anxiously at the quayside to see whether our ship will come in, there is now so much food swilling about in Western cities that most of us are more likely to die of obesity than hunger.”

“What could possibly go wrong? The short answer is: just about everything… Supermarkets supply us with 80 per cent of our food in Britain… Contrary to appearances, we live as much on a knife-edge now as did the inhabitants of ancient Rome or Ancien Régime Paris. Cities in the past did their best to keep stocks of grain in reserve in case of sudden attack; yet the efficiencies of modern food distribution mean that we keep very little in reserve. Much of the food you and I will be eating next week hasn’t even arrived in the country yet. Our food is delivered ‘just in time’ from all over the world: hardly the sort of system to withstand a sudden crisis.”

"Thanks, Humans. It Will Take New Zealand 50 Million Years To Recover Lost Bird Biodiversity.",https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/it-will-take-new-zealand-50-million-years-recover-its-lost-bird-biodiversity-180972827/,"When humans arrived on New Zealand some 700 years ago, they discovered a plethora of unusual birds that could be found nowhere else in the world, having evolved in isolation on the island. There was the giant moa, which could reach a height of seven feet, the Haast’s eagle, an enormous predator that hunted the moa, the laughing owl, known for its piercing cries. All of these birds, along with half of New Zealand’s avian taxa, have since gone extinct. And according to a new study in the journal Current Biology, it would take 50 million years to recover the bird biodiversity that has been lost.

The impact of humans on New Zealand’s avian species is relatively well understood. Because many of the nation’s birds were large and flightless, they were particularly susceptible to habitat alteration, introduced predators and hunting—first by the Polynesian Maori, then by European settlers. Today, some of the nation’s most iconic species remain at risk. The kākāpō, a chunky, flightless parrot, is considered critically endangered, pushed to the brink of extinction due to predation by cats and rats. The kiwi, New Zealand’s unofficial national emblem, is similarly threatened by dogs and ferrets, and is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

But according to the authors of the new study, “little is known about the long-term macroevolutionary impact of anthropogenic extinction. In other words, how far have humans perturbed this unique and isolated biological assembly from its natural state?”

To find out, the research team looked at previously collected archaeological and paleontological data, which pinpoint the times that many of New Zealand’s birds went extinct, according to Roni Dengler of Discover. The researchers also collected DNA sequences for extinct New Zealand birds, published in earlier studies. They then used computers to simulate a variety of human-induced extinction scenarios, estimating natural rates of extinction, speciation (the formation of new species) and colonization (the spread of a species into a habitat or ecological niche).

The team’s simulations showed that it will take an astonishing 50 million years to recover the number of bird species lost since humans arrived on New Zealand, which, as the study authors point out, “far exceed[s] the amount of time that humans have existed.” Additionally, the researchers found that if all of the nation’s threatened avian species were to go extinct, it would take around 10 million years for New Zealand’s birds to bounce back to today’s numbers.

“The fact that it is such a huge amount of evolutionary time lost really puts into perspective the impact that humans have already had on natural isolated systems,” Luis Valente, evolutionary biologist and lead author of the new study, tells Dengler.

Highlighting the scope of the loss is a 2017 study, also led by Valente, that showed it would take eight million years to recover the biodiversity of Caribbean bats—a relatively small amount of time compared to the situation in New Zealand. In fact, the study authors say their findings contradict the notion that species diversity would quickly recuperate if humans would simply leave nature well enough alone.

""[T]he reality is that, at least in New Zealand, nature would need several million years to recover from human actions—and perhaps will never really recover,” Valente says.

Moving forward, the study authors plan to estimate the evolutionary return times for other island nations, with the ultimate goal of helping conservationists prioritize areas where unique evolutionary histories have faced significant pressures. The good news is that New Zealand has in fact been working hard to save its threatened birds—and these efforts have been successful. Kākāpōs, for example, have been moved to predator-free islands off New Zealand’s coast, reported the Washington Post's Marylou Tousignant in March. Scientists keep a close eye on the birds through nest cameras, microchips and transmitters, and eggs are frequently removed to be raised in the safety of incubators. (The moms get a 3D-printed replacement egg to prepare them for hatch time.) In April, the country’s Department of Conservation announced that kākāpōs had their best breeding season on record.

“Regardless of the [conservation] path we choose, our results caution that the policy decisions we make today will have implications far into the future,” the authors of the new study conclude. “Luckily, New Zealand’s pioneering bird conservation efforts may yet prevent millions of years of evolutionary history from further being lost.”"
We are so fucked. Study concludes that by 2030 the climate will be like it was 3 million years ago. (When modern humans didn’t exist). 2-4 C warmer,https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/12/05/1809600115,"Significance The expected departure of future climates from those experienced in human history challenges efforts to adapt. Possible analogs to climates from deep in Earth’s geological past have been suggested but not formally assessed. We compare climates of the coming decades with climates drawn from six geological and historical periods spanning the past 50 My. Our study suggests that climates like those of the Pliocene will prevail as soon as 2030 CE and persist under climate stabilization scenarios. Unmitigated scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions produce climates like those of the Eocene, which suggests that we are effectively rewinding the climate clock by approximately 50 My, reversing a multimillion year cooling trend in less than two centuries.

Abstract As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129–116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 CE), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in RCP4.5 (<1%) but reach 8.7% of the globe under RCP8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, RCP4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as RCP8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity.

By the end of this century, mean global surface temperature is expected to rise by 0.3 °C to 4.8 °C relative to 1986–2005 CE averages, with more warming expected for higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions (1) and substantial effects predicted for the cryospheric (2), hydrologic (3), biological (4, 5), and anthropogenic (6) components of the Earth system. Understanding and preparing for climate change are challenged in part by the emergence of Earth system states far outside our individual, societal, and species’ experience. Traditional systems for designing infrastructure, mitigating natural hazard risk, and conserving biodiversity are often based on implicit assumptions about climate stationarity and recent historical baselines (7), which fail to encompass expected trends and recent extreme events (8, 9). Calls to keep the Earth within a “safe operating space” seek to keep Earth’s climates in the range of those experienced during the Holocene, which encompasses the time of development of agriculture and the emergence of the complexly linked global economy (10, 11). Societally novel climates are expected to emerge first in low-latitude and low-elevation regions (12⇓–14), while locally novel climates (future climates that have exceeded a baseline of local historical variability) are expected to begin to emerge by the mid- to late 21st century (15⇓–17).

However, all prior efforts to quantify the pattern and timing of novel climate emergence have been narrowly restricted to shallow baselines, in which the 20th and 21st century instrumental records are used for reference. This restriction overlooks the deep history of Earth’s climate variation and the societal, ecological, and evolutionary responses to this past variation. By considering only shallow temporal baselines, the evolutionary adaptive capacity of species to future novel climates may be underestimated. Conversely, others have drawn informal analogies between the climates of the future and those of the geological past (18, 19), but there has been no quantitative comparison. Here, we pursue a deeper baseline, formally comparing the projected climates of the coming decades with geohistorical states of the climate system from across the past 50 My. We seek to identify past states of the climate system that offer the closest analogs to the climates of the coming decades, the time to emergence for various geological analogs, and the distribution and prevalence of “geologically novel” future climates (i.e., that lack any close geological analog among the climate states considered here).

Identifying the Closest Paleoclimatic Analogs for Near-Future Earth Earth’s climate system has evolved in response to external forcings and internal feedbacks across a wide range of timescales (Fig. 1). Since 65 Ma, global climate has cooled (20), and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have declined (21). Several warm periods offer possible geological analogs for the future: the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma; hereafter the Eocene), the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (3.3–3.0 Ma; hereafter the Mid-Pliocene), the Last Interglacial (LIG; 129–116 ka), and the Mid-Holocene (6 ka). During the Eocene, the warmest sustained state of the Cenozoic, global mean annual surface temperatures were 13 °C ± 2.6 °C warmer than late 20th century temperatures (22), there was no permanent ice, and atmospheric CO 2 was approximately 1,400 parts per million volume (ppmv) (23). The Mid-Pliocene is the most recent period with atmospheric CO 2 comparable with the present (ca. 400 ppmv) (24), with mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8 °C to 3.6 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures, reduced ice sheet extents, and increased sea levels (25). During the LIG, global mean annual temperatures were approximately 0.8 °C (maximum 1.3 °C) warmer than preindustrial temperatures (26), and amplified seasonality characterized the northern latitudes (27). During the Mid-Holocene, temperatures were 0.7 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures (28), with enhanced temperature seasonality and strengthened Northern Hemisphere (NH) monsoons (27). Fig. 1. Temperature trends for the past 65 Ma and potential geohistorical analogs for future climates. Six geohistorical states (red arrows) of the climate system are analyzed as potential analogs for future climates. For context, they are situated next to a multi-timescale time series of global mean annual temperatures for the last 65 Ma. Major patterns include a long-term cooling trend, periodic fluctuations driven by changes in the Earth’s orbit at periods of 104–105 y, and recent and projected warming trends. Temperature anomalies are relative to 1961–1990 global means and are composited from five proxy-based reconstructions, modern observations, and future temperature projections for four emissions pathways (Materials and Methods). Pal, Paleocene; Mio, Miocene; Oli, Oligocene. Recent historical intervals also provide potential analogs for near-future climates (Fig. 1), including preindustrial climates (ca. 1850 CE) and a mid-20th century snapshot (1940–1970 CE). The preindustrial era represents the state of the climate system before the rapid acceleration of fossil fuel burning and greenhouse gas emissions, while the mid-20th century (“historical”) snapshot represents the center of the meteorological instrumental period that is the foundation for most societal estimates of climate variability and risk. Here, we formally compare projected climates for the coming decades with these six potential geohistorical analogs (Fig. 1) using climate simulations produced by Earth system models (ESMs). We focus on two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and find geohistorical analogs for projected climates for each decade from 2020 to 2280 CE. We analyze simulations for three ESMs with simulations available for the past and future periods considered here: the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2). To assess the similarity between future and past climates, we calculate the Mahalanobis distance (MD) based on a four-variable vector of mean summer and winter temperatures and precipitation (Materials and Methods). The climate for each terrestrial grid location for a given future decade is compared with all points in a reference baseline dataset that comprises the climates of all global terrestrial grid locations from all six geohistorical periods (SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2). For each location, we identify for each future climate its closest geohistorical climatic analog (i.e., the past time period and location with the most similar climate). We apply this global similarity assessment to each future decade from 2020 to 2280 CE. Future climates that exceed an MD threshold are classified as “no analog” (Materials and Methods), indicating that they lack any close analog in the suite of geological and historical climates considered here.

Discussion These analyses illustrate how the policy and societal choices represented by RCP emission scenarios are akin to choosing a geological analog, with higher-end scenarios causing near-future climates to resemble increasingly distant geological analogs. For RCP8.5, the emergence of Eocene-like climates indicates that the unmitigated warming of RCP8.5 is approximately equivalent to reversing a 50-My cooling trend in two centuries. Conversely, stabilization pathways, such as RCP4.5, are akin to choosing a world like the Mid-Pliocene (ca. 3 Ma). These analyses also indicate that the Earth system is well along on a trajectory to a climate state different from any experienced in our history of agricultural civilizations (last 7 ka) (34) and modern species history (360–240 ka) (35). Climate states for which we have good historical and lived experience (e.g., 20th century, preindustrial) are quickly diminishing as best analogs for the coming decades, while being superseded by climate analogs drawn from deeper times in Earth’s geological history (Figs. 2 and 3). Future climates also tend to exhibit greater geographic separation from their closest analogs over the coming centuries (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Efforts to keep the Earth within a safe operating space, defined as climates similar to those of the Holocene (11, 36), seem to be increasingly unlikely. However, most future climates do carry geological precedents, which provide grounds for both hope and concern. The prevalence of future novel climates in these analyses (Figs. 2 and 3) is far lower than in prior studies (13, 14), because the deeper baselines used here encompass a broader range of climate states than for analyses based on shallow baselines that comprise only 20th and early 21st century climates (Fig. 1). Conversely, the novel climates identified here carry greater import, because they highlight regions where projected climates lack any close analog among the geohistorical climate states considered here. These analyses underscore the utility of Earth’s history as a series of natural experiments for understanding the responses of physical and biological systems to large environmental change (37, 38). The availability of geological analogs to future climates also offers some evidence for ecoevolutionary adaptive capacity in that most future climates have equivalents in the deep evolutionary histories of current lineages. All species present today have an ancestor that survived the hothouse climates of the Eocene and Pliocene. However, these analyses also raise serious concerns about adaptive capacity. The large climate changes expected for the coming decades will occur at a significantly accelerated pace compared with Cenozoic climate change and across a considerably more fragmented landscape, rife with additional stresses. Over the past 50 My, evolutionary changes have been driven in part by species adapting away from hothouse climates to a world that was cooling, drying, and characterized by decreasing atmospheric CO 2 . For example, the rise of C 4 grasslands, grazing specialists, and other evolutionary changes during the Miocene (Mio) and the Pliocene are linked to increasing aridity, decreasing CO 2 , and rising temperatures (39). Thermophilous tree species in Europe seem to have been driven to extinction by Pliocene cooling and Quaternary glacial periods (40). The rates of temperature increases expected this century are at the high end of those recorded in geological history, with well-established counterparts only in the abrupt millennial-scale climate variations in the North Atlantic and adjacent regions during the last glacial period (41). Based on thermodynamic first principles, rising heat energy in the atmosphere–ocean system is expected to increase the frequency or intensity of extreme events (42) that are critical controls on species distributions and diversity. High rates of change is a defining feature of the emerging Anthropocene and a key difference between the climates of the near future and those of the geohistorical past.

Materials and Methods Past and Future Climate Simulations. A growing catalog of global climatic experiments with ESMs enables quantitative comparisons of future climate projections with potential analogs drawn from across Earth’s history. Since ESMs are computationally expensive, most paleoclimatic experiments are snapshot-style simulations (102–104 y) run for a sufficiently long time that trends in global mean surface temperature are small. They are used to study the climate response to forcings and feedbacks (e.g., Earth orbital variations, greenhouse gas concentrations) or understand particular phenomena (e.g., reduced zonal and meridional temperature gradients). Formal model intercomparison projects (27, 31, 43) prescribe common boundary conditions for paleoclimatic simulations. The six geohistorical time periods used here have all been the subject of multiple model–model and data–model comparisons (44, 45). Similarly configured ESMs are used to simulate Earth system responses to future scenarios of rising radiative forcings associated with greenhouse gas concentrations (46). RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are transient scenarios of rising radiative forcing associated with changes in greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric composition. RCP4.5 represents a stabilization of radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m2 and CO 2 concentrations of approximately 550 ppmv by 2100 CE (47). RCP8.5 is characterized by high greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in an increase in radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2 and CO 2 concentrations of approximately 1,000 ppmv by 2100 CE relative to the preindustrial (48). Beyond 2100 CE, RCP4.5 is extended assuming concentration stabilization in 2150 CE, and RCP8.5 is extended assuming constant emissions after 2100 CE followed by a smooth transition to stabilized concentrations after 2250 CE (46). Thus, RCP4.5 corresponds to an approximately 4.5 W/m2 total increase in radiative forcing by 2280 CE, while RCP8.5 corresponds to an approximately 12 W/m2 total increase. The atmospheric CO 2 concentrations for 2280 CE correspond to approximately 550 and 2,000 ppmv, respectively. We use a three-ESM ensemble (HadCM3, GISS, CCSM) to assess the similarity of future and past climates and identify best analogs. Analyses are conducted only within model family (e.g., future projections from the CCSM model are compared only with past CCSM simulations), because standard bias correction is not possible due to changes in paleogeography. For all past and future simulations, we create a standard climatology (typically a 30-y mean), with means calculated for four indicator variables: 1.5 m air temperature for December, January, and February (T DJF ); 1.5 m air temperature for June, July, and August (T JJA ); and total monthly precipitation for these two seasons (P DJF and P JJA , respectively). We apply a land–sea mask and an ice mask to restrict the analyses to terrestrial grid cells that are not covered by permanent ice. Simulations were bilinearly interpolated to a common T42 spatial resolution (128 cells longitude × 64 cells latitude; ca. 2.79° at the equator). Before regridding, individual simulations ranged from (72 × 46) to (288 × 192), with higher resolution typically associated with projections of future climate (SI Appendix, Table S1). We analyzed future climate projections for every decade between 2020 and 2280 CE, producing a future climate dataset of approximately 1,900 locations × 27 decades. Each decade is the center of a 30-y climatology; therefore, the entire dataset spans 2005–2295 CE, and individual decadal climatologies overlap their neighbors. The pool of potential past climate scenarios comprises 12,576 focal cells across the six past time periods for the HadCM3, 13,213 for the CCSM, and 10,483 for the GISS (for which no LIG simulation was available at time of this analysis). When multiple ensemble members were available, the first ensemble member was used. Climate Similarity Analyses. We apply the MD metric to quantify multivariate dissimilarity for future projections of climate using a four-variable vector of DJF and JJA temperature and precipitation. MD is calculated for each future climate point (i.e., for a given grid location and decade) relative to all points in a reference baseline of past climates that comprise the climates at all terrestrial grid locations across all geohistorical time periods. MD is calculated as follows: M D i j = ( b j → − a i → ) T S − 1 ( b j → − a i → ) , where a i refers to a vector of indicator variables (n = 4) from focal cell i of the reference baseline dataset, b j refers to a vector of indicator variables from focal cell j of the period for which dissimilarity is being assessed, and S−1 is the covariance matrix of the data estimated from the future and reference climatologies. For each future point, we conduct a series of one-to-many comparisons, where the similarity of each future point is compared with all points in the reference baseline. The past climate point with the minimum MD to the target future climate point is defined as the closest analog. Hence, the past analog can be drawn from any spatiotemporal location, and its selection is based only on climate similarity. See SI Appendix, Fig. S2 for an example location in Eurasia. The choice of multivariate distance metric and variables for climate similarity analyses has received increasing attention in recent years. Standardized Euclidean distance (SED) has been the standard (12, 13), although other metrics, including MD and sigma dissimilarity (14), have gained prominence. These metrics are appealing, because they consider the correlation structure among variables and down weight highly correlated variables. Here, we use MD for the primary analyses but also apply the SED metric as an alternative approach for quantifying multivariate dissimilarity (SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7). Its calculation is as follows: S E D i j = ∑ k = 1 n ( b k j − a k i ) 2 s 2 k , where k indexes the climate variables (n = 4), s k refers to the SD of variable k, and other variables are consistent with MD above. Dividing each variable by its variance seeks to standardize the values to a common scale. Hence, the calculated difference b k j − a k i is only important if it is large relative to s k . Due to the lack of availability of annually simulated climate values for all time periods, we use a modern estimate of interannual variability from 1960 to 1990 CE from the observational Climate Research Unit dataset (CRU TS 3.23) (49) for s k . Focal cells, where s k is zero for at least one variable, are mapped as NA (this happens when precipitation has a value of zero for the entire 30-y climatology). Results are generally similar between the MD and SED metrics, but the SED analyses indicate a slightly earlier arrival of Pliocene-like climates and greater prevalence of geologically novel climates (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Experiments basing climate similarity on two vs. four seasons suggest little effect on novelty (14). Conversely, the use of average annual temperature rather than seasonal minima and maxima tends to reduce the true dimensionality of climate space and underestimate the prevalence of novel climates (14). Hence, by defining climate as a vector of seasonal temperature and precipitation means, we balance the selection of climatic dimensions important to species distribution and diversity (50) with the availability of simulated climate data (30). Minimum and maximum monthly temperature estimates were unavailable for all model simulations included in our analyses. Our inclusion of four indicator variables, therefore, offers the best available assessment of climate analogs and novelty for our study design. Novel Climate Threshold. No-analog climates are defined as best-analog matches with MD values that exceed a prescribed threshold. Here, the no-analog threshold is defined as the 99th percentile of MD or SED values from the population of modern (1970–2000 CE) climates matched to their best analogs in preindustrial climates (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). As such, the climate of a focal location is different beyond nearly any distance that a modern location would exhibit compared with a preindustrial baseline. Paleotemperature Time Series. Fig. 1, used here to illustrate the evolution of the Earth’s climate system over the past 65 My (but not as the basis of any quantitative climate similarity analyses), includes five proxy-based temperature reconstructions (28, 51⇓⇓–54), a modern observational data product (55), and future temperature projections following four radiative concentration pathways (1). The benthic δ18O values were first converted to deep sea temperature approximations and then to surface temperature approximations (56). The European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) and North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) temperature anomalies are presented relative to the last millennium and core top, respectively, and assume a polar amplification factor of two. The Holocene temperature reconstruction shows the 5° × 5° area-weighted global mean temperature anomaly ±1σ. The Hadley Centre and Climatic Research Unit Temperature dataset, v. 4 (HadCRUT4) observational data product shows the 5° × 5° ensemble median and 95% confidence interval of the combined effects of all of the uncertainties described in the HadCRUT4 error model. Projected temperature anomalies after 2005 CE correspond to RCP scenarios 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. Solid lines correspond to multimodel means, and shading corresponds to the 5–95% model range. Discontinuities at 2100 CE are caused by a change in the number of models included in the ensemble. Projected temperature anomalies for RCP scenarios were shifted +0.3 °C to account for warming between the 1961–1990 and 1986–2005 CE reference periods used for the paleoclimatic time series and RCP scenarios, respectively (see ref. 1, table 12.2). Scaling of time varies among five panels to illustrate major features of the Earth’s climate history at different timescales. Geologic ages are expressed relative to 1950 CE. All climate similarity analyses are based on the paleoclimate and 21st century climate simulations from HadCM3, GISS, and CCSM. Figure design is modified from ref. 57 and (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:All_palaeotemps.png). Future Climate Space Mapped by Closest Past Climate Scenario. Plotting of future climates with respect to climate axes (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S5) shows how the global distribution of realized climates changes over the coming decades, with colors indicating the shifting sources of best geohistorical analogs. Due to changes in model forcings, future climate generally warms. Precipitation patterns are less unidirectional, with some regions warming and others drying.

The president’s declaration is likely to draw a court challenge, and Republicans on Capitol Hill had privately and publicly urged Trump to avoid such a move, fearing a future Democratic president could declare a national emergency on climate change, gun control or other liberal priorities.

Europe Is Warming Faster Than Even Climate Models Projected,https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-is-warming-faster-than-even-climate-models-projected,"Climate change is raising temperatures in Europe even faster than climate models projected, according to new research published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The number of summer days with extreme heat in Europe has tripled since the 1950s, while the number of days with extreme cold more than halved.

Extremely hot days in Europe have become hotter by an average of 4.14 degrees Fahrenheit, the study found, while extremely cold days have warmed by 5.4 degrees F. The research examined data from weather stations across Europe from 1950 to 2018, with more than 90 percent of stations showing that the climate was warming.

“Even at this regional scale over Europe, we can see that these trends are much larger than what we would expect from natural variability,” Ruth Lorenz, a climate scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and lead author of the new study, said in a statement. “That’s really a signal from climate change.”

The research comes after an extremely hot summer in Europe. Southern France hit 114.8 degrees F — a new record — in late June. Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium also recorded all-time national temperature highs. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced that July was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.

“In the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the model trends are about two times lower than the observed trends,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate analyst at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt, Netherlands, who was not connected to the new study. “We’re reaching new records faster than you’d expect.”"
Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism. Have we got the stomach for it?,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/ending-climate-change-end-capitalism?,"Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young, such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement, which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents’ generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on. In comparison, the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change. The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years, but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency. The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires, floods and hurricanes.

Today’s children, as they become more politically aware, will be much more radical than their parents, simply because there will be no other choice for them. This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise. The Green New Deal (GND), a term presently most associated with 29-year-old US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the “pro free market” wing, who argue that it’s a Trojan horse, nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation.

Think we should be at school? Today’s climate strike is the biggest lesson of all | Greta Thunberg and others Read more

The criticism feels ridiculous. Partly because the GND is far from truly radical and already represents a compromise solution, but mainly because the radical economics isn’t a hidden clause, but a headline feature. Climate change is the result of our current economic and industrial system. GND-style proposals marry sweeping environmental policy changes with broader socialist reforms because the level of disruption required to keep us at a temperature anywhere below “absolutely catastrophic” is fundamentally, on a deep structural level, incompatible with the status quo.

Right now we can, with a massive investment of effort by 2030, just about keep the warming level below 1.5C. This is “bad, but manageable” territory. Failing to put that effort in sees the world crossing more severe temperature barriers that would lead to outcomes like ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, mass desertification, and coastal cities being flooded into inhabitability.

We will simply have to throw the kitchen sink at this. Policy tweaks such as a carbon tax won’t do it. We need to fundamentally re-evaluate our relationship to ownership, work and capital. The impact of a dramatic reconfiguration of the industrial economy require similarly large changes to the welfare state. Basic incomes, large-scale public works programmes, everything has to be on the table to ensure that the oncoming system shocks do not leave vast swathes of the global population starving and destitute. Perhaps even more fundamentally, we cannot continue to treat the welfare system as a tool for disciplining the supposedly idle underclasses. Our system must be reformed with a more humane view of worklessness, poverty and migration than we have now.

Unfortunately for our children, the people they have to convince of all this are the people who have done very well out of this system, and are powerfully incentivised to deny that it is all that bad. Already, Joke Schauvliege, a Belgian environment minister, has been forced to resign after falsely claiming that she had been told by Belgian state security services that “ghosts” behind the scenes were behind demonstrations in Belgium.

This conspiracism of the elite, these claims that genuine mass movement can’t possibly really exist and must be in some way being guided by agents provocateurs, is just one of the ways in which those currently running things have resorted to a kind of political gaslighting in an attempt to maintain their grip on power.

Play Video 3:18 Dianne Feinstein rebuffs young climate activists' calls for Green New Deal – video

Gaslighting is a term I don’t use lightly, because it describes a genuine form of emotional abuse, where an abuser will deny reality in an attempt to get their victim to literally doubt their own sanity, and this should not be diluted by overuse. Yet I struggle to think of another word that adequately sums up the way in which “sensible” adults are doubling down on their tactic of manufacturing a political reality which bears no relationship to the world we see around us. It’s the Marxism of Groucho rather than Karl: “Who are you going to believe? The serious political professionals or your own lying eyes?”

US Senator Dianne Feinstein’s meeting with schoolchildren petitioning her to take action over the issue went viral because of the way she condescended to them for, basically, asking her to leave them a planet behind to live on. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” she said, “I know what I’m doing.” The obvious response is, of course, that messing something up for 30 years is quite long enough, thanks. Long tenure without results is not the same thing as expertise.

This is a tough and bitter pill to swallow for the political professionals whose feet are firmly under the table. It is increasingly obvious that all their tactics have done almost nothing except run down the clock, but still they insist that it’s the young who just don’t get it and that things aren’t that simple. They’re the living embodiment of the famous New Yorker cartoon, with a suited man sat in a post-apocalyptic landscape telling his young audience “Yes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.”

This is reality v the vested interests of the powerful. Any meaningful policy has to upset the established power base and the political donor class. Any policy that doesn’t upset these people will be useless. To pretend that we can compromise our way through this while we wait for a magical, technological bullet that will keep temperatures down without costing us anything is beyond wilful ignorance now. It is a question of basic morality.

Many of today’s climate strikers won’t even be 30 by the time the 1.5C deadline comes around in 2030. They are asking us to consider a simple question: is their future worth more than preserving our reputations? What will our response to them be?

"World on track to lose two-thirds of wild animals by 2020, major report warns",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/27/world-on-track-to-lose-two-thirds-of-wild-animals-by-2020-major-report-warns,"Living Planet Index shows vertebrate populations are set to decline by 67% on 1970 levels unless urgent action is taken to reduce humanity’s impact

The number of wild animals living on Earth is set to fall by two-thirds by 2020, according to a new report, part of a mass extinction that is destroying the natural world upon which humanity depends.

The analysis, the most comprehensive to date, indicates that animal populations plummeted by 58% between 1970 and 2012, with losses on track to reach 67% by 2020. Researchers from WWF and the Zoological Society of London compiled the report from scientific data and found that the destruction of wild habitats, hunting and pollution were to blame.



The creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders.

The collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the Anthropocene, a proposed new geological era in which humans dominate the planet. “We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,” said Prof Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, in a foreword for the report.

Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, said: “The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse.”

He said humanity was completely dependent on nature for clean air and water, food and materials, as well as inspiration and happiness.

The report analysed the changing abundance of more than 14,000 monitored populations of the 3,700 vertebrate species for which good data is available. This produced a measure akin to a stock market index that indicates the state of the world’s 64,000 animal species and is used by scientists to measure the progress of conservation efforts.

The biggest cause of tumbling animal numbers is the destruction of wild areas for farming and logging: the majority of the Earth’s land area has now been impacted by humans, with just 15% protected for nature. Poaching and exploitation for food is another major factor, due to unsustainable fishing and hunting: more than 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction, according to recent research.

Pollution is also a significant problem with, for example, killer whales and dolphins in European seas being seriously harmed by long-lived industrial pollutants. Vultures in south-east Asia have been decimated over the last 20 years, dying after eating the carcasses of cattle dosed with an anti-inflammatory drug. Amphibians have suffered one of the greatest declines of all animals due to a fungal disease thought to be spread around the world by the trade in frogs and newts.

Rivers and lakes are the hardest hit habitats, with animals populations down by 81% since 1970, due to excessive water extraction, pollution and dams. All the pressures are magnified by global warming, which shifts the ranges in which animals are able to live, said WWF’s director of science, Mike Barrett.

Some researchers have reservations about the report’s approach, which summarises many different studies into a headline number. “It is broadly right, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts,” said Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University in the US, adding that looking at particular groups, such as birds, is more precise.

The report warns that losses of wildlife will impact on people and could even provoke conflicts: “Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources.”

Agriculture and overuse greater threats to wildlife than climate change – study Read more

However, some species are starting to recover, suggesting swift action could tackle the crisis. Tiger numbers are thought to be increasing and the giant panda has recently been removed from the list of endangered species.

In Europe, protection of the habitat of the Eurasian lynx and controls on hunting have seen its population rise fivefold since the 1960s. A recent global wildlife summit also introduced new protection for pangolins, the world’s most trafficked mammals, and rosewoods, the most trafficked wild product of all.

But stemming the overall losses of animals and habitats requires systemic change in how society consumes resources, said Barrett. People can choose to eat less meat, which is often fed on grain grown on deforested land, and businesses should ensure their supply chains, such as for timber, are sustainable, he said.

“You’d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,” Barrett said. Politicians must also ensure all their policies - not just environmental ones - are sustainable, he added.

“The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,” said Barrett. “My hope though is that we don’t throw our hands up in despair - there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.”"
"Oceans Are Warming 40% Faster Than Predicted by ""taking up at least 90 percent of the excess heat in the atmosphere."" Warmer seas absorb less carbon dioxide, so more CO2 will ultimately stay in the atmosphere.",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oceans-are-warming-faster-than-predicted/,"Up to 90 percent of the warming caused by human carbon emissions is absorbed by the world’s oceans, scientists estimate. And researchers increasingly agree that the oceans are warming faster than previously thought.

Multiple studies in the past few years have found that previous estimates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may be too low. A new review of the research, published yesterday in Science, concludes that “multiple lines of evidence from four independent groups thus now suggest a stronger observed [ocean heat content] warming.”

Taken together, the research suggests that the oceans are heating up about 40 percent faster than previously estimated by the IPCC. Since the 1950s, studies generally suggest that the oceans have been absorbing at least 10 times as much energy annually, measured in joules, as humans consume worldwide in a year.

While much of the human concern about climate change focuses on its effects over land—rising air temperatures, changes in weather patterns and so on—accurate estimates of ocean warming are deeply important to scientists’ understanding of global warming. Determining how fast the oceans are warming helps scientists calculate how sensitive the planet is to greenhouse gas emissions and how quickly it may warm in the future.

“The ocean, in many ways, is the best thermometer we have for the planet,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a co-author of the new analysis.

Accelerated warming is also a big concern for ocean ecosystems, driving mass coral bleaching events all over the world and forcing some species to migrate to cooler waters. Warming also causes ocean water to expand in volume, which can contribute to sea-level rise.

For nearly two decades, scientists have used a network of floats distributed throughout the ocean to constantly monitor water temperatures worldwide. But before the early 2000s, when the network was launched, scientists mainly relied on measurements taken from passing ships as they made their way across the seas. This meant ocean temperature observations, worldwide, were sparser and that scientists had to use statistical methods or models to fill in the gaps.

In recent years, improved data from the float network and improvements in the models and statistical tools used to analyze previous measurements have helped scientists develop more accurate reconstructions of ocean warming over the past century.

As the new review reports, multiple studies now agree that the oceans are warming at a faster rate than older estimates suggested. And these revised calculations also match up better with climate model simulations than previous estimates, giving scientists more confidence that model projections for the future are on track.

And if the models are accurate, continuing to emit greenhouse gases at the current rate could result in dire consequences for the global oceans. As the new analysis points out, models suggest that a business-as-usual climate scenario could cause nearly 1.5 degrees of ocean warming—the equivalent of nearly a foot of sea-level rise by the end of the century. Meeting the Paris Agreement’s climate goals, on the other hand, could cut that warming in half.

Scientists aren’t only interested in how much heat the oceans are soaking up. How that heat moves around the planet can reveal important clues about how high the seas might rise in different locations, for instance.

Another study, published earlier this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also concluded that the oceans are taking up at least 90 percent of the excess heat in the atmosphere. It also found that they’ve been warming since at least the late 1800s, although its estimates for the rate of warming may be a bit lower than what some of the other recent studies have suggested.

The study suggests that the oceans’ large-scale currents and circulation patterns have been changing in recent decades—for reasons scientists are still investigating—and that these changes are affecting the places where ocean heat ends up.

The study suggests that up to half the extra heat stored up in the midlatitude regions of the Atlantic Ocean since the 1950s was actually transported there from other parts of the ocean. This means that heat-related sea-level rise in this part of the ocean is being influenced by changing circulation patterns.

That’s important to pay attention to, the researchers note, because future climate change may cause even bigger shifts in ocean currents, many of which are heavily influenced by winds and atmospheric patterns that may be affected by global warming. Monitoring these changes could help scientists predict which parts of the ocean will warm—and expand—the fastest in the future.

“Future changes in ocean transport could have severe consequences for regional sea-level rise and the risk of coastal flooding,” the authors write.

Trump Reveals Plans for Nationwide Crackdown and More Militarized Police,https://www.truthdig.com/articles/trump-reveals-plans-for-nationwide-crackdown-and-more-militarized-police/,"President Donald Trump on Monday said the Justice Department is preparing to launch a sweeping crackdown on crime that he named “the surge,” a term commonly associated with the George W. Bush administration’s decision to send tens of thousands of additional troops into Iraq in 2007.

“In coming weeks, Attorney General Barr will announce a new crackdown on violent crime—which I think is so important—targeting gangs and drug traffickers in high crime cities and dangerous rural areas,” Trump said during the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago. “Let’s call it the surge.”

The president did not provide any details on the plan but said it is going to be “very dramatic.”

“And you’re going to see tremendous results very quickly,” Trump added.

As if to emphasize his view of America’s cities as war zones, Trump went on to tout his administration’s success in putting military equipment into the hands of U.S. police officers and claimed “Afghanistan is a safe place” compared to Chicago.

“To help keep you safe, I’ve made $600 million-worth of surplus military equipment available to local law enforcement,” Trump told the audience of police chiefs. “If you remember, the previous administration didn’t want to do that… They didn’t want to make you look so tough. They didn’t want to make you look like you’re a threat.”

Watch Trump’s remarks:

Trump’s visit to Chicago, the first of his presidency, was met with massive protests led by Indivisible Chicago and other progressive advocacy groups. Striking Chicago public school teachers also cleared their Monday afternoon schedule to take part in demonstrations against the president.

“We have heard that President Donald Trump might be in town,” leaders of the Chicago Teachers Union wrote in an email to members late Sunday. “If any members were inclined to show up outside his fundraiser in red, that would qualify as productive, in our view.”

Thousands of protesters gathered and marched outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in downtown Chicago, where the president attended a big-money campaign fundraiser after the law enforcement conference:

“We’re angry,” Marj Halperin of Indivisible Chicago told The Guardian. “He is taking pleasure in the misery of our city. He doesn’t know us. He’s coming to our city to raise money, largely from people who don’t live in this city, without ever having addressed, supported, listened to the people who really need help.”"
Expert Says Indians Will Soon Become Water Refugees Heading for Water-Rich Europe,https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/j5ygy7/expert-says-indians-will-soon-become-water-refugees-heading-for-water-rich-europe,"This article originally appeared on VICE India

As various reports show India approaching ‘Day Zero’ (the day when a place’s taps dry out and people have to stand in line to collect a daily quota of water), a top Indian expert has warned that Indians may soon become “water refugees” who’ll migrate to water-rich European countries. Rajendra Singh, a Magsaysay-winning conservationist and environmentalist, and popularly known as the “Waterman of India”, made this statement at the recently-concluded Stockholm International Water Institute.

India is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, with almost 50 percent of the country facing drought-like situation. In fact, 21 major Indian cities will start running out of groundwater by next year, affecting millions. But Singh adds that as more than 70 percent of aquifers in India dry up, people are going to start migrating westwards unless we fix it. He compared the situation to parched regions in Africa and Asia, from where people have migrated to European states and precipitated political crisis among and within the EU states. He also added that this may disturb the harmony of the world.

“In India, such migration is taking place from villages to cities. However, the current water crisis may lead to such climatic migration in the future to other countries,” he told The Press Trust of India. In fact, in India, a March 2019 report by the World Resources Institute has warned that the climate change impact will be considerable because of its large population—at 1.37 billion as of September 18—depending heavily on environment-sensitive sectors such as agriculture. “These factors make adaptation critical,” says the report.

Reports have also shown India is facing horrible droughts and floods, both at the same time. “This deadly combination of floods and droughts cannot be tackled by providing piped water but only through community-driven water management,” said Singh. “The responsibility of providing water to everyone can only be fulfilled if the government collaborates with people at the ground level rather than handing over the work to contractors, whose only interest is to earn benefits or profits.”

However, even though it seems like much is lost, Singh says things can still be fixed. One could be to discontinue the use of mechanised herbicides and pesticides, which are messing with the water aquifer system. Other ways to salvage the crisis, he said, would be to develop water harvesting systems to protect our reservoirs from drying up in the sun. This way, the country can develop reserve banks of water even when there’s a drought-like situation. He also stressed on indigenous methods of water management, designed by the local people.

But with the statistics suggesting much is lost, it’s safe to say that India is running out of time. “In fact, we have lost all the time to act,” said Singh. ""A country whose 70 percent aquifers are dry has no time left.”"

Show Caption Hide Caption Suicide can be preventable if we know the warning signs On average, there are 123 suicides per day in the United States. If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK.

Correction & clarification: A prior version of this column misspelled Halle Berry's name.

In September of 2004, I received the call that every person dreads: My father had dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 61. It came at a time when I was already grappling with other issues, including watching my mother fight breast cancer for the preceding six months, a breakup with a boyfriend and a lack of structure in my life as I was freelancing as a consultant while I tried to determine what I wanted to do next with my career.

I was in an emotional free fall, so I visited a psychiatrist. He said the antidepressant my general practitioner prescribed to help with my life-long struggle with anxiety wasn't what I needed, so he prescribed a new one. This seemed to only make things worse. Within a few days, I found myself thinking the unthinkable: I want to die.

I couldn’t imagine a life without my father and our hours-long conversations about, well, everything. The pain was debilitating, getting out of bed was an Olympian event, and life was utterly devoid of meaning. I stopped eating and shed 15 pounds in a month. I couldn’t see any reason to be alive.

I’ve thought a lot about this period following the suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, two people who by public appearances seemed to be living their best lives. We also learned this week that suicide rates have risen nearly 30% since 1999, making it a national crisis.

I decided to share my story after interviewing John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, who happens to be my future brother-in-law. “What people don’t really know is that there is research that shows the media can reduce suicide,” Draper told me. “What creates a contagion effect is when the media focus mostly on the suicide and the way the person killed themselves. If people are more open about talking about coping through suicidal experiences, and the media highlight those stories, the evidence is very clear that this has a very positive effect on getting people through a suicidal crisis.”

Anthony Bourdain's death highlights rising suicide rate among middle-aged adults

So it might help a person contemplating suicide to read that I am thankful I didn’t succumb to my suicidal impulses. Or to learn that people like Halle Berry, Elton John and Drew Barrymore attempted and survived suicide. Or that Oprah, Olympian Michael Phelps and singer Demi Lovato considered suicide but didn’t go through with it.

Many factors in suicide

We often assume that people who commit suicide are mentally ill, but this isn’t always the case. There are many factors that can contribute to suicide that have nothing to do with mental illness, including loss of a relationship, loneliness, chronic illness, financial loss, history of trauma or abuse and the stigma associated with asking for help.

Even for those who do ask for help, friends and family can be flummoxed by “successful people” planning their own deaths. My family and friends told me I was “living the dream” and that I was “too strong” to succumb to suicide. Even my psychiatrist didn’t take my complaints seriously, saying I didn’t present as a suicidal person who was more likely to show up disheveled and unbathed than with a blowout and a fresh manicure.

Never mind that the day before, I had stood pressed against the 20th floor bathroom window of a building where I was consulting for a campaign, sobbing and wishing I could open it and jump to my death. Or that a few days before that, I had turned on the oven and put my head in, pulling it out only when an image of my younger brothers, also grieving my father’s sudden death, flashed in my mind.

Despite my doctor’s claim that nothing was wrong, I insisted that he change my anti-depressant, and within a few weeks my suicidal thoughts diminished. I’ll never know whether the anti-depressant was the cause of my suicidal thoughts or not. What I do know is that every day I didn’t kill myself felt like a victory.

Though my suicidal thoughts passed, an oppressive depression ground me down that year. Life was an agonizing and daily struggle. So, when I hear that Kate Spade was reportedly fighting depression and anxiety for five years, all I can think is that it was nothing short of heroic for her to stay alive as long as she did.

Why we suffer emotional despair

“What a lot of people don’t understand is that a person contemplating suicide is in overwhelming emotional pain and they think very differently than people who are rational,” Draper told me. “It’s cognitive constriction. Your pre-frontal cortex goes off line and you have a flight, fight or freeze impulse. In that case suicide seems like the best way out or the best way to fight for your survival. They think, maybe my afterlife will be better.”

But why are so many more Americans getting to this level of emotional despair than in the past? As journalist Johann Hari wrote in his best-selling book Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression — and the Unexpected Solutions, the epidemic of depression and despair in the Western world isn’t always caused by our brains. It’s largely caused by key problems in the way we live.

We exist largely disconnected from our extended families, friends and communities — except in the shallow interactions of social media — because we are too busy trying to “make it” without realizing that once we reach that goal, it won’t be enough.

In an interview this year, the comedian and actor Jim Carrey talked about “getting to the place where you have everything everybody has ever desired and realizing you are still unhappy. And that you can still be unhappy is a shock when you have accomplished everything you ever dreamed of and more.”

If only we get that big raise, or a new house or have children we will finally be happy. But we won’t. In fact, as Carrey points out, in many ways achieving all your goals provides the opposite of fulfillment: It lays bare the truth that there is nothing you can purchase, possess or achieve that will make you feel fulfilled over the long term.

Rather than pathologizing the despair and emotional suffering that is a rational response to a culture that values people based on ever escalating financial and personal achievements, we should acknowledge that something is very wrong. We should stop telling people who yearn for a deeper meaning in life that they have an illness or need therapy. Instead, we need to help people craft lives that are more meaningful and built on a firmer foundation than personal success.

Yes, there are people who have chemical imbalances who should be supported and treated with medicine. But most Americans are depressed, anxious or suicidal because something is wrong with our culture, not because something is wrong with them.

Changing our culture is critical. Being honest with others about our own personal struggles and dark nights of the soul is the first step. People on the edge need to hear stories that assure them there is a way through the all-consuming pain to a meaningful life.

I’ve told mine, now go tell yours.

"‘There Will Be Mass Starvation,’ Moscow Opposition Warns Mayor as Coronavirus Closes Businesses",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/14/there-will-be-mass-starvation-moscow-opposition-warns-mayor-as-coronavirus-slams-economy-a69975,"Moscow and its 12.7 million residents have been under lockdown since March 30, with all nonessential businesses and activities suspended until at least May 1. Nationwide, the fallout from President Vladimir Putin’s paid “non-working month” could see unemployment numbers rise from 2.5 million to 8 million this year, the country’s Audit Chamber estimates.

A lack of aid for Moscow’s small and medium businesses hit by the coronavirus lockdown will lead to mass starvation and widespread protests, opposition lawmakers have reportedly warned Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.

“Failure to take [support] measures in the coming months may lead to mass starvation,” the Communist Party — the Moscow City Duma’s second-largest faction — told Sobyanin in a letter, the Kommersant business daily reported Monday.

“In the event of spontaneous unsanctioned protests attended by several thousand residents, all responsibility will fall on Moscow’s executive authority,” party leader Nikolai Zubrilin reportedly warned Sobyanin.

Among other steps, the opposition reportedly demanded to hand each Muscovite 20,000 rubles ($250), pay all of their 2020 utility bills out of the city budget and suspend loan payments until Dec. 31. To finance these expenses, the Communists want to reduce spending on Moscow’s sprawling renovation program, metro construction and other non-essential municipal projects.

The Communist Party’s calls follow fellow opposition party Yabloko’s proposal to reroute 300 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) of the city’s infrastructure and entertainment budget toward aid for SMEs and employees on unpaid leave.

About one-third of Russian companies forced employees to take leave without pay from the first week of Putin’s non-working period, according to a survey by the Center for Strategic Research, a think tank close to the government.

In an effort to support entrepreneurs, the government has rolled out tax cuts and offered deferred payments. The Central Bank has released funds for banks so they can offer cheap loans to small businesses.

Lawmakers are due Tuesday to submit legislation to help small and medium-sized businesses, measures that critics say could already be too late for many businesses.

Nearly half of the 1,000 companies surveyed by the Center for Strategic Research have already reduced wages, 16% announced redundancies and 9% anticipated bankruptcy this year.

Sobyanin has warned that “we’re nowhere near the peak” of Moscow’s coronavirus outbreak as Russia has seen accelerated growth in new infections in recent days. Moscow has become the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic within Russia, with 13,002 of the country’s 21,102 cases reported in the capital as of Tuesday.

Emaciated grizzly bears in Canada spark greater concerns over depleted salmon population,https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/americas/emaciated-grizzly-bears-knights-inlet-canada-trnd-scn/index.html,"(CNN) With hibernation fast approaching, a grizzly bear family is spotted searching for fish near the shores of Canada's Knight Inlet. They're emaciated.

The heartbreaking images, captured by a Canadian photographer, have sparked concern from wildlife observers. They worry whether the bear and two cubs will even make it through hibernation.

It also shines light on another victim of the climate crisis and the depletion of wild salmon population.

Knight Inlet is a prime tourist spot in British Columbia, Canada for grizzly bear viewing. Visitors from all over the world come to take in the wilderness and admire the wildlife.

The Mamalilikulla First Nation has been monitoring the bears, specifically those in Hoeya Sound and Lull Bay, for several years.

""They have drastically changed within a couple months,"" Jake Smith, guardian watchman manager for the Mamalilikulla First Nation, told CNN. ""The bears are in trouble.""

Smith said when he saw the images on Friday, he knew he had to try to help. The bears' main food source, salmon, is at an all time low in the area. Commercial fishermen in British Columbia are calling this the worst salmon season in nearly 50 years.

In August, a report released by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada noted that Canada's climate is warming twice as fast as the global average, drastically impacting the salmon's ecosystems. The report also cited marine heatwaves, increased floods and droughts as causing greater stress on the fish.

Smith arranged for 500 salmon, donated by A-Tlegay Fisheries Society on Vancouver Island, to be distributed along the shorelines that the grizzlies frequent. Volunteers on Sunday piled the fish in ice chests and delivered them by boat to the area. Smith said bears were present and started eating the fish right away.

""We were about 30 feet away from them,"" Smith said. ""A little grizzly looked up at us and the mother bear came out to get the fish.""

While this is only a small step to help the bears, the First Nation will now continue to monitor the bears for any updates.

Causes of decline in wild salmon population

The wild salmon population has been steadily declining in the British Columbia area over the past few years. Just last month, advocates for commercial fishing asked the government for disaster relief to help the industry.

""The impacts of this climate change disaster has been coast wide,"" said Joy Thorkelson, president of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union, at a press conference in September.

The warmer weather has impacted the temperature of the water and drastically impacted the salmon run this year, according to CNN news partner CTV.

Another factor for the wild salmon population loss is the open-net fish farming that critics say are spreading disease and pollution in the water.

biologist Alexandra Morton, who has been researching the effects of farming for the past 30 years. This type of farming allows for waste to be added back into the water and exposes the wild salmon population to viruses, according to Morton. ""Everywhere in the world where there is salmon farming you have a decline in the wild salmon population,"" saidwho has been researching the effects of farming for the past 30 years. This type of farming allows for waste to be added back into the water and exposes the wild salmon population to viruses, according to Morton.

farming by 2023 so that the wild salmon population can recover. In December, the British Columbia government along with First Nations created a plan to transition out of open-netfarming by 2023 so that the wild salmon population can recover. The Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance has defended open-net farming as environmentally sustainable, calling plans to phase out open-net farming ""a reckless policy, not grounded in science.""

Bears forced to travel far for food

Rolf Hicker, a wildlife photographer, took the images of the thin bears while giving a boat tour. He posted them on Facebook on September 23.

""We saw this sow with her two little ones a couple of weeks ago and then we saw her again only a few days ago,"" he posted. ""I have no idea how she would make it through the winter without salmon.""

More than half of Canada's grizzly population lives in British Columbia, and their average weight is 220 to 880 pounds, according to the Nature Conservancy of Canada . They forage for berries and plants, but salmon is their main food source.

Hicker told CNN that not all of the bears that he's seen are this thin, but the majority are not healthy.

Smith and Hicker said the grizzlies are starting to relocate and island hop to other areas, including Vancouver Island, looking for food.

""Provincial biologists cannot confirm why the bears appear to be in poor shape,"" said a statement from the province's Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.

""If salmon runs in the area are lower than expected, this will have an added effect and bears may have to travel further to find food.""

Grizzly bears hibernate for five to seven months each year and live off the fat built up during the summer and fall months, according to the National Park Service . If female bears go into hibernation leaner than normal, this might impact how many cubs she has, according to Parks Canada.

""Grizzlies are not native to Vancouver Island,"" said Hicker. "" They are spending all their energy swimming to go to another location. They are being forced to do that for food.""

Swanson Island, about an hour boat ride from Knight Inlet, is another location where grizzlies are showing up, Smith said.

""They were approaching our camps, and we are seeing them in areas we rarely ever see bears,"" Rick Snowdon, owner of Spirit of The West , told CNN. He takes tourists to Swanson Island for camping trips and kayaking.

Snowdon said while they haven't had a negative interaction with the bears, they have had to emphasize to guests to use caution.

""I've seen several grizzles with cubs,"" he said. ""They definitely looked lightweight.""

The natural resources ministry told CNN they will be meeting with First Nations on Thursday to discuss the situation."
"Keystone Pipeline leaks 383,000 gallons of oil in North Dakota",https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/10/31/us/keystone-pipeline-leak-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Part of the Keystone 1 Pipeline in North Dakota was shut down after a leak of about 9,120 barrels of oil -- 383,040 gallons -- was discovered, TC Energy company said in a statement.

Keystone pipeline leak

The oil leak was discovered just north of Edinburg, in the northeast part of the state, and affected about 2,500 square yards of land, the company said. A drop in pressure was detected on Tuesday, and the pipeline was immediately shut down, the company said.

The company is not sure how the leak started, but says an independent party is examining the pipeline.

""We are establishing air quality, water and wildlife monitoring and will continue monitoring throughout the response. There have been no reported injuries or impacted wildlife,"" TC Energy said.

""The safety of the public and environment are our top priorities and we will continue to provide updates as they become available."""
BP and Shell planning for catastrophic 5°C global warming despite publicly backing Paris climate agreement,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bp-shell-oil-global-warming-5-degree-paris-climate-agreement-fossil-fuels-temperature-rise-a8022511.html?fbclid=IwAR1MWXkNtNDhLUIyunY1XsUxKPjHzqQbSCjaofm-wdhYnxrfCq-Zy6hOj2I,"Oil giants Shell and BP are planning for global temperatures to rise as much as 5°C by the middle of the century. The level is more than double the upper limit committed to by most countries in the world under the Paris Climate Agreement, which both companies publicly support.

The discrepancy demonstrates that the companies are keeping shareholders in the dark about the risks posed to their businesses by climate change, according to two new reports published by investment campaign group Share Action. Many climate scientists say that a temperature rise of 5°C would be catastrophic for the planet.

ShareAction claims that the companies’ actions put the value of millions of people's pensions at risk. Two years after BP and Shell shareholders voted resoundingly in favour of forcing the companies to make detailed disclosures about climate risks, the companies have made unconvincing steps forward, according to the reports.

ShareAction said that Shell and BP are meeting their legal requirements, but are putting shareholders’ capital at risk because of numerous failings in their plans for the future.

Neither company sets targets to reduce emissions and BP’s total investment in renewable and clean technologies has actually shrunk since 2005, the reports said. That’s despite the company’s public-facing image of being “beyond petroleum”.

BP invests just 1.3 per cent of its total capital expenditure in low-carbon projects while Shell has pledged to invest 3 per cent of its annual spend on low-carbon by 2020.

Both companies assess the resilience of their businesses against climate models in which temperatures warm by between 3°C and 5°C.

A maximum warming of 2°C beyond pre-industrial levels is the central aim of the landmark Paris climate agreement, which both firms say they support. It is widely believed that any warming beyond 2°C could cause serious and potentially irreversible changes to the climate.

Shell reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement in a statement publicising its most recent AGM. “Shell has a clear strategy, resilient in a 2°C world,” the company said, but its change modelling document states that “the emissions pathways until the middle of the century overshoots the trajectory of a 2°C goal”.

ShareAction’s report also found that top executives at both Shell and BP are still given incentives to pursue strategies centred on oil and gas and are paid bonuses over three to six years for fossil fuel projects that could have damaging effects for shareholders decades later.

Michael Chaitow, senior campaigns officer at ShareAction, said the report revealed an “uncomfortable discrepancy” between Shell and BP’s public support for a low-carbon economy and their actual business planning.

“Shell and BP want to have their oil and drink it too, by advocating for the landmark Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rises to below 2°C degrees, while planning for scenarios that would violate it,” he said.

The group called on Shell and BP shareholders, which include powerful institutional investors, to demand that the two oil companies do more to tackle climate change.

In 2015, more than 98 per cent of shareholders in both Shell and BP voted for resolutions that require the companies to regularly report on their emissions, resilience to climate change, investment in low-carbon technology and executive incentives.

The resolutions helped pave the way for subsequent shareholder resolutions on climate-related disclosure at oil and gas companies including Exxon and Occidental Petroleum.

"More than 4 million Americans file for jobless aid, bringing pandemic total above 40 million",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/4-million-file-unemployment-jobless-claims/,"More than 4 million U.S. workers filed for jobless benefits last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That brings the total number of people applying for aid to more than 43 million, on a seasonally adjusted basis, since the coronavirus pandemic spread across the nation.

Put another way, 1 in 4 U.S. workers has applied for jobless aid in the last 10 weeks.

""Unemployment claims made during the coronavirus crisis have already exceeded the 37 million claims made over the entire 18 months of the Great Recession,"" Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, said in a note. ""[T]he labor market remains in a deep hole it will have to climb out of.""

Some 2.4 million workers applied for regular unemployment insurance in the week ending May 16, marking a slight decrease from the week before. But nearly as many — 2.2 million — applied for aid under Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a new federal program for self-employed and gig workers.

The self-employed were not being counted in previous weekly jobless figures until last week. The true number of jobless self-employed people is likely even higher, as not all states are currently reporting their PUA payout figures, noted economist Heidi Shierholz.

The number of first-time applications for traditional jobless aid has steadily declined each week since peaking in late March, indicating that the waves of layoffs are slowing. However, the figures remain staggering by historical standards, demonstrating that severe economic pain is widespread even as the majority of U.S. states reopen their economies.

""[R]eopening the economy does not necessarily equate with robust rehiring,"" Andy Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, wrote in a note. While 35 states reopened last week, nine of them actually saw an increase in the number of new workers claiming unemployment benefits, he pointed out.

""The unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 14.7% — a figure I hoped that I would never see in my lifetime, and one that is sure to get worse before it gets better,"" John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Thursday morning.

""It's likely that the latest numbers do not reveal the full extent of the financial devastation faced by millions of American families. The data don't capture those who had to leave their jobs, either for their own health or to take care of loved ones,"" Williams said.

A congressional budget watchdog has predicted unemployment will remain above 11% for the rest of the year — higher than its peak during the Great Recession in 2009.

How soon the economy begins to recover, and how fast the recovery is, depends largely on both government economic-stimulus policy and the pace of medical progress against the novel coronavirus, Wall Street analysts say.

""It's not impossible to imagine the economy roaring back to life once a vaccine is widely available,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a note.

The expanded unemployment benefits that have allowed many people to keep supporting themselves despite being out of work run out at the end of July. Democrats in Congress have pushed for an expansion of jobless aid, while Republican lawmakers have called for federal assistance to be phased out as shuttered employers reopen around the country."
Coronavirus sabotages the immune system like HIV in a significant number of patients,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/health/coronavirus-immune-system.html?referringSource=articleShare,"At the beginning of the pandemic, the coronavirus looked to be another respiratory illness. But the virus has turned out to affect not just the lungs, but the kidneys, the heart and the circulatory system — even, somehow, our senses of smell and taste.

Now researchers have discovered yet another unpleasant surprise. In many patients hospitalized with the coronavirus, the immune system is threatened by a depletion of certain essential cells, suggesting eerie parallels with H.I.V.

The findings suggest that a popular treatment to tamp down the immune system in severely ill patients may help a few, but could harm many others. The research offers clues about why very few children get sick when they are infected, and hints that a cocktail of drugs may be needed to bring the coronavirus under control, as is the case with H.I.V.

Growing research points to “very complex immunological signatures of the virus,” said Dr. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania whose lab is taking a detailed look at the immune systems of Covid-19 patients."
"The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs acidified the ocean in a 'flash,' killing most marine life. The seas could see a similar problem a century from now.",https://www.businessinsider.com/asteroid-that-killed-dinosaurs-triggered-ocean-acidification-2019-10,"Vadim Sadovski/Shutterstock

A massive asteroid struck present-day Mexico 66 million years ago. The impact contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs and 75% of life on Earth at the time.

The asteroid crash spurred a mile-high tsunami, wildfires, and the release of billions of tons of sulfur that blotted out the sun and led the planet to cool, killing many land-based species.

A new study reveals that marine species weren’t spared: Acid rain and fallout from the impact acidified the world’s oceans in a „flash.“ That caused marine ecosystems to collapse.

Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more stories.

About 66 million years ago, an asteroid more than 6 miles wide struck modern-day Mexico. The impact sparked wildfires that stretched for hundreds of miles, triggered a mile-high tsunami, and released billions of tons of sulfur into the atmosphere.

Within a minute of hitting the Earth, the Chicxulub asteroid had bored a hole nearly 100 miles wide into the sea floor, creating a bubbling pit of molten rock and super-hot gas. The contents of that fiery cauldron skyrocketed, creating a mountain-high plume that poured acid rain into the oceans.

While scientists knew catastrophic events on land following the asteroid’s impact triggered the mass extinction of 75% of life on Earth (including the dinosaurs), the mechanism by which ocean species perished was less certain. Now, a study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the barrage of acid rain following impact was probably the killer.

After the asteroid crash, the study authors wrote, the oceans underwent rapid and intense acidification. That then disrupted marine food webs and sparked a mass extinction.

„It’s flash acidification, and it transformed ecosystems for millions of years,“ Noah Planavsky, one of the study’s authors, told the New York Times.

Tiny fossil shells reveal what happened after impact

To unravel the mystery of what happened following the fateful asteroid crash, scientists either examine rocks that were deposited during or after the impact, or seek out fossils of creatures that died around the time Chicxulub hit.

In this case, the lead author of the study, Michael Henehan, found a revealing layers of clay in the Geulhemmerberg cave in the Netherlands. The clay contained rocks dating back to both the time right before the impact, as well as the moments after the crash. The rocks in each layer held fossilized shells of microscopic plankton called foraminifera.

Henehan and his team were able to examine levels of chemical isotopes in those shells, which offered clues about the plankton died.

Henehan’s team found that the proportion of boron isotopes — a measurement that can serve as a proxy for ocean acidity — suggested there was an increase in the acidification of the seas over the 100 to 1,000 years following the Chicxulub asteroid impact. He told The Guardian that the walls of the fossilized shells also appeared „much thinner and poorly calcified after the impact.“

Overall, these clues suggest, oceanic pH dropped by 0.25 units on the pH scale within a millennium of the asteroid crash. (The scale starts at 0 for fully acidic and goes up to 14 for fully alkaline; typically, the ocean is alkaline.)

Though a millennium might seem like a long time, it means the oceans‘ surface acidified in a „flash“ on a geologic scale, according to the study authors. That acidification wiped out many plankton species, which triggered the global collapse of marine food chains and the subsequent mass extinction of ocean life.

„We show ocean acidification can precipitate ecological collapse,“ Henehan added. „Before we had the idea, but we did not have the empirical proof.“

Ocean acidification today could trigger a similarly severe collapse

According to the study authors, this discovery has ramifications for our understanding of the current state of our seas.

Earth’s oceans absorb 30% of the carbon-dioxide emissions that humans release. That causes chemical reactions in the water that acidifies the sea. Oceanic pH has already dropped 0.1 units —a 30% increase in acidity — since the start of the Industrial Revolution.

The pH drop that happened 66 million years ago was only 2.5 times the decrease that we’ve seen over the last 250 years. According to the Smithsonian Institute, oceanic pH is expected to drop another 0.3 to 0.4 pH units by the end of the century.

„If 0.25 was enough to precipitate a mass extinction, we should be worried,“ Henehan said.

Ocean acidification is happening at a faster rate than at any point in the last 300 million years, according to a 2012 study. Planavsky told the New York Times that this rate could be comparable to the flash acidification that followed the dinosaur-killing asteroid.

A mass extinction like that one „is on the extreme end of what we could get in the next 100 years,“ he said."
"Noam Chomsky: 'In a couple of generations, organized human society may not survive.'",https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/02/12/features/noam-chomsky-couple-generations-organized-human-society-may-not-survive-has-be,"Join Noam Chomsky and National Observer editor Linda Solomon Wood for a Zoom conversation on April 23, 4 p.m. Pacific Time.



The elegant simplicity of his campus office — a small round table with several straight-backed chairs, a laptop on an uncluttered desk — contrasts with his reputation as one of the world’s leading public intellectuals. Now aged 90, Noam Chomsky continues to write, and is co-teaching a course on politics and global crises at the University of Arizona. Apart from his paradigm-creating work in linguistics, Chomsky has been an outspoken and cogent critic of American foreign policy and its connection with human rights violations and military aggression around the world. With his colleague, the late Ed Herman, Chomsky developed a “propaganda model” of the corporate mass media to help explain the economic and political elite’s ability to maintain ideological legitimacy. A range of “filters” — corporate ownership, advertising dependence, establishment-oriented sourcing practices, flak from right-wing critics, and ideological anti-Communism — cause news media to function as a propaganda system reinforcing elite power. In recent years, Chomsky has turned his prodigious mind to the existential threat of global warming, a “threat to the perpetuation of organized human life,” on par with nuclear war. Now, in an exclusive interview with National Observer on Jan. 22, Chomsky directly addresses the specific relationship between media and the climate crisis.

National Observer: In recent years, you have said a great deal about the severity of the climate crisis — and you’ve offered various examples of how the corporate media are oblivious to its scope. How would you evaluate the general role of corporate media in relation to that crisis? Do the kind of filters identified in your and Ed Herman’s propaganda model of the media help to explain corporate media’s shortcomings on global warming, or do other factors make global warming an especially difficult issue for journalism? Noam Chomsky: Take a standard story. There are reports on what’s happening. So, if you look at the New York Times today, for example, there’s a pretty good article on the new discoveries on the melting of the polar ice caps which happens to be, as usual, more drastic than the (earlier) estimates; that’s been typical for a long time. And it discusses the probable impact on sea level rise, albeit conservatively, given how dramatic it has obviously been. So, there are regular articles that appear — it’s not that global warming is ignored. On the other hand, if you look at a standard article on oil exploration, the New York Times can have a big front page article on how the U.S. is moving towards what they call energy independence, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia in fossil fuel production, opening up new areas, Wyoming, the Midwest, for fracking. They do a long article, maybe 1,000 words — I have one particular example in mind — it will mention environmental consequences, it may harm the local water resources for ranchers, but literally not a word on the effect on global warming. And that happens in article after article in every outlet — the Financial Times, the New York Times, all the major newspapers. So, it’s as if on the one hand, there’s a kind of a tunnel vision — the science reporters are occasionally saying look, ‘this is a catastrophe,’ but then the regular coverage simply disregards it, and says, 'well, isn’t this wonderful, we won’t have to import oil, we’ll be more powerful,' and so on. So, they’re not making the connection? It’s a kind of schizophrenia, and it runs right through society. Take the big banks, JP Morgan Chase, for example. They’re the biggest bank and CEO Jamie Dimon is an intelligent man. I’m sure he knows the basic facts about the dire threat of global warming, yet at the same time they’re pouring investments into fossil fuel extraction, because that’s the business model. They have to make a profit tomorrow. So, the overall role of the corporate media has been to fail to connect the dots?

Of course, I’m talking about the liberal media. If you go to say, Fox News, it’s quite different: global warming is just not happening. And in fact, that shows up in public opinion. About half of Republicans simply deny that global warming is taking place. And, of the other half, a slight majority thinks humans may be involved. Take the hearings, just a couple of days ago, for the new head of the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, who is a guy with a background in the coal industry. A senator asked him, 'What do you think about global warming?' He says, 'Yes it’s probably taking place, humans are probably involved.' And he was asked, 'How urgent do you think it is?' And his answer was, 'It’s probably eighth or ninth in the level of urgency, so it’s something out there.' And the effect is that nothing is being done. In terms of the media themselves, do the kinds of filters you’ve identified in the propaganda model help explain their shortcomings, or are some other factors at work as well? Yeah, but it’s almost transparent. They are wedded to the corporate business model which is: you have to make a profit tomorrow. And society has to grow. They don’t care what kind of growth, it just has to grow. And that’s just kind of internalized. So, yes, the advertisers have an effect, and the fact they are a corporation has an effect. But deeper than that, is a point that George Orwell made, one which I think is underestimated (and which we didn’t actually discuss in our Manufacturing Consent book). I don’t know if you ever read the introduction to Animal Farm — probably not, because it was suppressed — but it came out after it was discovered in his papers about 30 years later, and it’s kind of an interesting introduction. The book is addressed to the people of England and he says this book is, of course, a satire about the totalitarian enemy, but he says we shouldn’t feel too self-righteous about it because — I’m quoting now — in free England, ideas can be be suppressed without the use of force. Noam Chomsky: 'In a couple of generations, organized human society may not survive. That has to be drilled into people’s heads constantly.' Orwell gives some examples, and about two sentences of explanation. One is that the press is owned by wealthy men who have every interest in not wanting certain ideas to be expressed, but the other is just essentially a good education. You go on to the best schools, graduate from Oxford and Cambridge, and you just have instilled into you the understanding that there are certain things it wouldn’t do to say — and you don’t even think about it any more. It just becomes what Gramsci called ""hegemonic common sense,"" you just don’t talk about it. And that’s a big factor, how these things simply become internalized. People who bring them up sound like crazies. What would be the alternative for journalism? How should it operate differently in addressing climate change? Every single journal should have a shrieking headline every day saying we are heading to total catastrophe. In a couple of generations, organized human society may not survive. That has to be drilled into people’s heads constantly. After all, there’s been nothing like this in all of human history. The current generation has to make a decision as to whether organized human society will survive another couple of generations, and it has to be done quickly, there’s not a lot of time. So, there’s no time for dillydallying and beating around the bush. And pulling out of the Paris negotiations should be regarded as one of the worst crimes in history. But isn’t there a risk of disempowering people by just giving them bad news? There is. Bad news should be combined with discussion of the things that can be and are being done. For example, a very good economist, Dean Baker, had a column a couple of weeks ago in which he discussed what China is doing. They are still a big huge polluter, but they are carrying out massive programs of switching to renewable energies way beyond anything else in the world. States are doing it. Or not. Take Arizona here, you drive around here, the sun is shining all the time, most of the year; take a look and see how many solar panels you see. Our house in the suburbs is the only one that has them nearby. People are complaining that they have a thousand dollar electric bill per month over the summer for air conditioning but won’t put up a solar panel; and in fact the Tucson electric company makes it hard to do. For example, our solar (array) has some of the panels missing because you’re not allowed to produce too much electricity. That’s unfortunate. Where would you see the kind of journalism that combines urgency with a sense of what can be done? Where do you see that in our media system?

Well, you find it in small journals. The point is, global warming should be emphasized. You’re quite right when you say you just can’t keep pouring in the bad news; people turn around. But if you combine the bad news with the positive steps that could be taken, and the urgency of taking them, then I think it can have an effect. Is it mainly in alternative independent media where you do see this coverage of climate crisis as a crisis? You get it in the alternative media, but it doesn’t reach enough of the general public.

And not just this crisis, but others as well. A comparable crisis is the threat of nuclear war. On January 24th, it would be a good idea to look at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, that’s the day when they’re supposed to come out with the next setting of the doomsday clock.* It’s already two minutes to midnight; I don’t know what they’re going to do next time, maybe put it past midnight! It’s basically two things, nuclear war and global warming, both of which are increasingly dire. But there’s more. Take the threat of a pandemic. Industrial meat production is first of all inhumane, but secondly, it’s a major contributor to global warming; and it’s also destroying the effectiveness of antibiotics. They have wild overuse of antibiotics, and it’s creating mutant bacteria that are resistant to any antibiotics, showing up in hospitals that could lead to a huge pandemic, like the flu pandemic a century ago which killed tens of millions of people. People talk about a migrant crisis, what’s it going to be like when Bangladesh is flooded, hundreds of millions of people have to flee? South Asia is running out of water, already there are hundreds of millions of people that barely have water; with the glaciers melting and so on, they may lose their water supply. What happens to the world then? It’s just going to be colossal problems. They’re not far off. Are there particular media outlets that you yourself find useful, in the alternative or independent sector or elsewhere, where you get your own information? I read the major media, but it’s really the science journals that keep you up to date. Of course, that’s technical stuff which you wouldn’t normally read, but they have very good reports of it in the Washington Post, the New York Times and of course a lot of the alternative media. Do you think that in the U.S. or other notionally democratic societies, is it possible to reform the media system in some ways that would better facilitate this kind of survival journalism? One way would be for them to become democratic societies. They’re very far from it. Take elections — there’s very convincing work in mainstream political science which shows that elections in the United States are basically bought. You can predict the outcome of an election for Congress or Executive with remarkable precision just by looking at the single variable of campaign spending. That’s why when somebody’s elected to the House of Representatives, the first day in office, she or he has to start gaining donor support for the next election. Meanwhile, legislation is being written by the staff with the lobbyists from the corporations, who are actually often just writing the legislation. It’s a kind of democracy, but a very limited one. Do you see a possibility for media reform apart from broader social and political transformations? Because there is a movement, as you know, specifically for media reform, with Robert McChesney and many others. There’s lots that can be done. The system has to be significantly modified in many ways, even radically modified. Media reform is one of them. Bob McChesney’s important work is a model. There are things that can be done. The increased monopolization of the major media is a serious matter, as you know well, but if you look at Ben Bagdikian’s book on the media monopoly back around 1980, there were maybe 50 sources of news, now it’s down to half a dozen. The advertising-profit model for media has just undermined journalism. You go back to the early days even of the United States — the government recognized the significance of having a free and independent press, and simply subsidized things like free postal rates, which were devices to try to create an independent press. I just recently read a very interesting book, The Framers’ Coup by Michael Klarman. It’s now the gold standard on the formation of the constitution; it goes into tremendous detail on the discussions that were going on, and they’re pretty impressive. There was a pamphlet literature, there was an independent press literature, people were contributing and farmers and craftsmen and everybody getting their two cents in, a model of discussion. Back in the mid-19th century, there was a very lively labour and ethnic press which was doing very interesting things. It pretty much collapsed under the concentration of capital and the advertising model, and the same in England, though in England it lasted even longer, until the 1960s. Do you see much hope for an alternative on the internet and social media? There’s hope, but social media have been very much a two-edged sword. They are clearly creating a kind of echo chamber, a bubble system. We all do it, people gravitate to the things you believe in and don’t hear other views — your own just get reinforced. It’s leading to almost an impossibility of interaction. Some of this is pretty shocking. I was reading some statistics recently, and it turns out according to some recent polls, that the number of Americans who use the major media as their prime information source is single digits, it’s about six per cent. Most of them are going to social media which don’t produce the news, they filter it, they don’t have reporters out in the field. And then of course you have innovations like talk radio and Fox, which are new. They are just really vicious propaganda systems, barely pretending to be anything else. That’s the dark side. The good side is that (social media is) the way organizing goes on. That’s the way you reach out to people, get together, and it’s a very effective tool. Practically all organizing works this way. I mean even teaching, teachers often communicate with the students through social media. That’s all anybody is doing. If you walk around campus, everybody’s (on a device). One university, I think Duke University, started putting on the pavements things that say, Look up!, because they’re all walking around looking down. Definitely what the effects are is hard to say. You see teenage kids sitting in a McDonalds, let’s say, sitting around a table and there are two conversations going on — one in the group, and one that each person is having with whoever’s talking to them on their phone. It just breaks down meaningful social relations. It could perhaps be a potential resource, at least — alternative media using the internet for climate communication. Blogs, Truthout, Truthdig, Common Dreams, Democracy Now, many others, are producing all kinds of information which you can’t get on television. So it’s potentially extraordinarily useful, but it has this negative aspect which is being pressed hard by the Silicon Valley giants on the advertising model, so it’s being forced on you all the time. You search for something on Google and you’re inundated by things you’re supposed to want, and that’s the impact of the big advertisers. What conditions need to be met to enable an effective response to climate crisis? I think there just has to be an energetic mass popular movement, which is going to compel the media to address the crises that we’re facing by constant pressure, or else simply create alternatives which will dominate the information market. And we don’t have a lot of time to waste. So, things like subsidizing independent media which is not a utopian idea, it was done in the United States in its early days; or the kinds of grassroots media movements that, say, Bob McChesney and others are pressing to develop. And it’s an urgent requirement. I start my classes these last couple of years by simply pointing out to the students that they have to make a choice that no one in human history has ever made. They have to decide whether organized human society is going to survive. Even when the Nazis were on the rampage, you didn’t have to face that question. Now you do. Beyond the media, are there other general conditions that have to be met to get out of climate crisis? There are several groups organizing large-scale activism, like Earth Strike, which is planning a series of actions; they already had the first one, big demonstrations in many cities, trying to build up to a mass general strike. The Extinction Rebellion from England has moved here, trying to do the same thing. But these dramatic actions, like demonstrations generally, they’re not of any effect if they’re isolated events. They have to be a stimulus for the constant organizing and education that has to go on day-to-day. And again, just take what we talked about before — Tucson, solar panels. People have to come to understand that they’ve just got to do this, and fast; and it doesn’t harm them, it improves their lives. For example, it even saves money. But just the psychological barrier that says that I can’t look at this, that I have to keep to the common beliefs, and that this is somehow a radical thing that we have to be scared of, is a block that has to be overcome by constant educational organizational activity. The way every other popular movement developed — the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, the feminist movement — just constant, often very small groups, growing into bigger groups for activism. Occasionally they have a dramatic action like a demonstration, but mainly to stimulate ongoing activity. And it can’t be delayed. *Editor's Note: On Jan. 24, the scientists maintained the doomsday clock at two minutes to midnight, warning humanity not to become complacent about the “new abnormal.” Editor's Note: The article was updated on Feb. 14 to correct the spelling of the name of JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon."
Alaska's sea ice has completely melted away,https://mashable.com/article/alaska-sea-ice-melt-2019/,"Alaska's exceptional summer continues.

The most rapidly changing state in the U.S. has no sea ice within some 150 miles of its shores, according to high-resolution sea ice analysis from the National Weather Service. The big picture is clear: After an Arctic summer with well above-average temperatures, warmer seas, and a historic July heat wave, sea ice has vanished in Alaskan waters.

""Alaska waters are ice free,"" said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.

""This is definitely an extreme year — even by more recent standards in a changed Arctic,"" noted Walt Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

In the continually warming Arctic, sea ice has completely melted around the Alaskan coast before, notably during 2017's melt season, but never this early. ""It's cleared earlier than it has in any other year,"" said Thoman. (Sea ice starts regrowing again in the fall, when temperatures drop.)

Arctic sea ice has been either been at record lows or flirting with record lows throughout much of the summer. ""I’m losing the ability to communicate the magnitude [of change],"" Jeremy Mathis, a longtime Arctic researcher and current board director at the National Academies of Sciences, told Mashable in June, when sea ice levels were at their lowest point in the satellite record for that period. ""I’m running out of adjectives to describe the scope of change we’re seeing.""

Even during the winter, historically ice-clad seas were nearly free of ice. The Bering Sea, in early March, was open ocean. That's not normal for winter. ""It's normally pretty much covered completely with ice,"" said Meier.

""I’m losing the ability to communicate the magnitude [of change]""

A fundamental problem is that most of the sea ice around Alaska, and in the greater Arctic, is young. Over the past few decades, the older, thicker, multiyear sea ice has been melted away by warmer ocean and air temperatures. (And this July, the seas around much of Alaska, the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, were some 9 or 10 degrees Fahrenheit above average, noted Meier.) Only the thin, more vulnerable sea ice remains.

""The loss of the multiyear ice is really a big driver here,"" emphasized Thoman. ""First-year ice is much more susceptible to the vagaries of weather.""

The weather, swayed by climate, is often warmer than it was last century. The resulting, relentless ice loss is one of the most conspicuous results of a rapidly heating climate. Just like glaciers.

""This is due to the long-term warming of the Arctic,"" Zack Labe, a climate scientist and PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, explained in June. ""Air temperatures are now rising at more than twice the rate of the global mean temperature — a phenomenon known as 'Arctic Amplification'.""

Last month set the lowest July #Arctic sea ice volume on record in this data set (PIOMAS). The volume was about 47% less than the 1979-2018 average!

The Arctic's warming is especially amplified by the ocean. When reflective, white sea ice vanishes, the darker ocean absorbs solar energy, rather than reflecting it back into space. To boot, this warmth then mixes around with other waters, warming them too, explained Thoman.

It's a vicious cycle. And the consequences are ramping up.

""Things are not necessarily gradual,"" said Thoman, referencing the big changes occurring in and around Alaska ""When thresholds get crossed, changes occur in a hurry."""
[Article from India] As many as 74% of consumers said they are in no mood to spend on anything other than essentials post lockdown.,https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=708584,"New Delhi, May 15 (IANS): Discretionary spending has taken a massive hit as consumers are deferring non-essential purchases due to the uncertainty caused by the spread of coronavirus.

According to a survey by Local Circles, consumers in red zones were asked once the lockdown is relaxed in their areas what items would they spend on, to which 74 per cent consumers said they are in no mood to spend on anything other than essentials post lockdown. The survey received over 24,000 votes from consumers spread across 124 red zone districts of the country.

Overall, the numbers in this survey show a big shift in the consumer mindset post COVID-19 lockdown, as 42 per cent now want to get items of need delivered to their doorsteps so that they could follow the social distancing protocols.

Also, post the lockdown relaxation, when it comes to services, people will spend most on air conditioners, fridge, appliance repairs, home repairs and salon/beauty services.

In cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad and Mumbai which have been under the lockdown for almost 50 days now, the consumer concerns are the highest where many haven't been able to get products and services they need.

Local Circles said as the lockdown is eased out in red zones post May 17, the survey and discussion feedback indicates that there will be a spike in spending on what is called as the secondary essential products and services outlined in this report. Spending on discretionary products and services that are not of primary and secondary need will continue to take a hit in the short to medium term.

Consumers in red zones say they want to buy gadgets, home supplies and office/school supplies post upcoming lockdown relaxations.

Consumers in red zones were asked once the lockdown is relaxed in their areas, what 'products' in specific will they spend on. At least 5 per cent said they would buy gadgets like laptop, printer, tablet, mobile etc., while another 5 per cent said they will buy office/school supplies like stationary, mobile accessories, books etc. A total of 4 per cent said they would buy white goods & appliances like AC, cooler, refrigerator, grinder etc., 1 per cent said automobiles (car/scooter), 6 per cent said home furnishing & supplies while 2 per cent said fashion & apparels. At least 3 per cent said they will spend on other non-essential items.

As many as 74 per cent consumers said they are in no mood to spend on anything other than essentials post lockdown.

Discretionary spending has taken a massive hit as consumers are deferring non-important purchases due to the uncertainty caused by the spread of Coronavirus.

If consumer choices are bifurcated based on only the ones who said they will spend on non-essentials post lockdown relaxations, Local Circles said it can be adjudged that 19 per cent would buy gadgets like laptop, printer, tablet, mobile etc., while another 19 per cent will buy office/school supplies like stationary, mobile accessories, books etc. 15 per cent would buy white goods & appliances like AC, cooler, refrigerator, grinder etc., 4 per cent automobiles (car/scooter), 23% home furnishing & supplies while 8 per cent will spend on fashion & apparels. 12 per cent consumers will spend on other non-essential items.

Consumers in red zones were asked if they are looking at spending post lockdown relaxations in any of the non-essential categories, namely gadgets, office/school supplies, white goods, automobile, home furnishings, fashion etc., how will they purchase them. In response, 33 per cent said they will order via ecommerce while 41 per cent said they will visit a retail store. 9 per cent said they will get it delivered from a retail store while 17 per cent were unsure about it."
Prince says we have 18 months to save the world. Commonwealth leaders will all fly to Rwanda next year for a meeting about it. No rush...,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/07/11/18-months-save-world-prince-charles-urges-commonwealth-leaders,"The Prince of Wales has warned global leaders they have 18 critical months to solve climate change and restore the balance of nature, ensuring the survival of the human race.

The Prince, addressing foreign ministers from around the Commonwealth, said they were ""uniquely positioned"" to lead the world by example, urging them to match ambition with “the practical action that is required”.

Speaking as the future head of the Commonwealth, a position which was confirmed during a convention in London last year, he emphasised that the next 18 months would see ""critical meetings that will collectively determine the global agenda for the coming decade"".

The leaders of Commonwealth countries will gather next year in Rwanda for a week-long summit, at which they will discuss the ""unparalleled challenges caused by rapid climate change and biodiversity loss"".

In a speech during a reception at Clarence House, the Prince said: “Ladies and gentlemen, I am firmly of the view that the next 18 months will decide our ability to keep climate change to survivable levels and to restore nature to the equilibrium we need for our survival."
"Oceans losing oxygen at unprecedented rate, experts warn .",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/07/oceans-losing-oxygen-at-unprecedented-rate-experts-warn,"Oxygen in the oceans is being lost at an unprecedented rate, with “dead zones” proliferating and hundreds more areas showing oxygen dangerously depleted, as a result of the climate emergency and intensive farming, experts have warned.

Sharks, tuna, marlin and other large fish species were at particular risk, scientists said, with many vital ecosystems in danger of collapse. Dead zones – where oxygen is effectively absent – have quadrupled in extent in the last half-century, and there are also at least 700 areas where oxygen is at dangerously low levels, up from 45 when research was undertaken in the 1960s.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature presented the findings on Saturday at the UN climate conference in Madrid, where governments are halfway through tense negotiations aimed at tackling the climate crisis.

Grethel Aguilar, the acting director general of the IUCN, said the health of the oceans should be a key consideration for the talks. “As the warming ocean loses oxygen, the delicate balance of marine life is thrown into disarray,” she said. “The potentially dire effects on fisheries and vulnerable coastal communities mean that the decisions made at the conference are even more crucial.”

All fish need dissolved oxygen, but the biggest species are particularly vulnerable to depleted oxygen levels because they need much more to survive. Evidence shows that depleted levels are forcing them to move towards the surface and to shallow areas of sea, where they are more vulnerable to fishing.

Some ocean areas are naturally lower in oxygen than others, but these are even more susceptible to damage when their oxygen levels are depleted further, the report’s authors said. Species that can more easily tolerate low oxygen levels, such as jellyfish, some squid and marine microbes, can flourish at the expense of fish, upsetting the balance of ecosystems. The natural oceanic cycles of phosphorus and nitrogen are also at risk.

The world’s oceans are already being overfished, and assailed by a rising tide of plastic waste, as well as other pollutants. Seas are about 26% more acidic than in pre-industrial times because of absorbing the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with damaging impacts on shellfish in particular.

Low oxygen levels are also associated with global heating, because the warmer water holds less oxygen and the heating causes stratification, so there is less of the vital mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor layers. Oceans are expected to lose about 3-4% of their oxygen by the end of this century, but the impact will be much greater in the levels closest to the surface, where many species are concentrated, and in the mid to high latitudes.

Intensive farming also plays a major role. When excess artificial fertiliser from crops, or manure from the meat industry, runs off the land and into rivers and seas, it feeds algae which bloom and then cause oxygen depletion as they decompose.

The problem of dead zones has been known about for decades, but little has been done to tackle it. Farmers rarely bear the brunt of the damage, which mainly affects fishing fleets and coastal areas. Two years ago, the meat industry in the US was found to be responsible for a massive dead zone measuring more than 8,000 sq miles in the Gulf of Mexico.

This year’s UN climate conference, known as COP25, was originally billed as the “Blue COP”, with a spotlight on the oceans for the first time in the history of the negotiations. The focus was chosen because of the original location in Chile, a country with more than 4,000km of coastline and a strong reliance on the marine economy.

But the move to Madrid, forced by political unrest in Santiago, has meant many of the planned events have been curtailed. Scientists and activists gathered in landlocked Madrid are trying to highlight the issues by demonstrating how vital the seas are in protecting us from climate chaos – as they absorb so much of the excess carbon dioxide, and excess heat, in the atmosphere – and how much they are at risk from its impacts.

Protecting marine life could help the oceans to function better, soaking up more carbon and providing barriers against sea level rises and storm surges, in the form of coral reefs and mangrove swamps.

“A healthy ocean with abundant wildlife is capable of slowing the rate of climate breakdown substantially,” said Dr Monica Verbeek, the executive director of the group Seas at Risk. “To date, the most profound impact on the marine environment has come from fishing. Ending overfishing is a quick, deliverable action which will restore fish populations, create more resilient ocean ecosystems, decrease CO2 pollution and increase carbon capture, and deliver more profitable fisheries and thriving coastal communities.”

“Ending overfishing would strengthen the ocean, making it more capable of withstanding climate change and restoring marine ecosystems – and it can be done now,” explained Rashid Sumaila, professor and director of the fisheries economics research unit at the University of British Columbia. “The crisis in our fisheries and in our oceans and climate are not mutually exclusive problems to be addressed separately – it is imperative that we move forward with comprehensive solutions to address them.”

A study published at COP25 by Greenpeace International showed that restoring marine ecosystems could play a major role in tackling climate chaos."
US income inequality jumps to highest level ever recorded | Markets Insider,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/income-inequality-reached-highest-level-ever-recorded-in-2018-2019-9-1028559996,"Thomson Reuters

Income inequality in the US last year reached its highest level in more than half a century.

While the economy has expanded steadily over the past decade, it has disproportionately benefited some of the wealthiest Americans.

In February, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said income inequality would be one of the biggest challenges for the US over the next decade.

Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories.

Income inequality last year reached its highest level in more than half a century, as a record-long economic expansion continued to disproportionately benefit some of the wealthiest Americans.

A key measure of wealth distribution jumped to 0.485 in 2018, the Census Bureau said Thursday, its highest reading since the so-called Gini index was started in 1967. The gauge, which uses a scale of 0 to 1, stood at 0.482 a year earlier.

Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas, and Virginia saw income inequality rise significantly last year. Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico saw the highest Gini index readings, while Utah was among the lowest.

Real median household income rose by 0.8%, to $61,937, in 2018, a slightly smaller increase than in the three previous years, the Census Bureau said. The economy has expanded steadily over the past decade, which has helped to push the unemployment rate to historic lows.

But a majority of growth has gone to higher-income earners and the owners of financial instruments, said Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who studies poverty and economic mobility.

""Wages remain low, there is a lack of childcare for single-parent families, and so on. Work alone won't solve poverty — unless wages and earnings pick up substantially,"" he said. ""It still takes government aid for families with children and others who do not earn enough, despite working 40-plus hours a week.""

Jay Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has echoed concerns about economic mobility in the US. In February, he said that income inequality would be one of the biggest challenges facing the US over the next decade.

""We want prosperity to be widely shared,"" Powell said. ""We need policies to make that happen.""

UN chief says world about to hit 'point of no return' on climate change,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/un-chief-says-world-about-to-hit-point-of-no-return-on-climate-change-1.4710249,"MADRID -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Sunday that the world's efforts to stop climate change have been ""utterly inadequate"" so far and there is a danger global warming could pass the ""point of no return.""

Speaking before the start Monday of a two-week international climate conference in Madrid, the UN chief said the impact of rising temperatures -- including more extreme weather -- is already being felt around the world, with dramatic consequences for humans and other species.

He noted that the world has the scientific knowledge and the technical means to limit global warming, but ""what is lacking is political will.""

""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" Guterres told reporters in the Spanish capital. ""It is in sight and hurtling toward us.""

Delegates from almost 200 countries will try to put the finishing touches on the rules governing the 2015 Paris climate accord at the Dec. 2-13 meeting, including how to create functioning international emissions trading systems and compensate poor countries for losses they suffer from rising sea levels and other consequences of climate change.

Guterres cited mounting scientific evidence for the impact that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are already having on the planet, including record temperatures and melting polar ice.

But he insisted that his message was ""one of hope, not of despair. Our war against nature must stop and we know that that is possible.""

Countries agreed in Paris four years ago to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times. Already, average temperatures have increased by about 1C, leaving little room for the more ambitious target to be met.

Guterres said growing demands from citizens, particularly young people, have shown there is widespread desire for climate action.

""What is still lacking is political will,"" he said. ""Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels. Political will to stop building coal power plants from 2020 onwards. Political will to shift taxation from income to carbon. Taxing pollution instead of people.""

Guterres noted that some 70 countries -- many of them among the most vulnerable to climate change -- have pledged to stop emitting more greenhouse gases by 2050.

""But we also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight. And without them, our goal is unreachable,"" he said.

The UN chief said he hoped the meeting in Madrid would see governments make more ambitious pledges ahead of a deadline to do so next year.

He also said that creating a worldwide market for emissions, which is a key element of the sixth article of the Paris accord, remained one of the most contentious issues for negotiators.

""We are here to find answers for article 6, not to find excuses,"" Guterres said.

Guterres also announced that outgoing Bank of England governor Mark Carney will become his new special envoy on ""climate action and climate finance"" from next year.

Organizers expect around 29,000 visitors, including some 50 heads of state and government for Monday's opening, as well as scientists, seasoned negotiators and activists during the two-week meeting.

Some of the world's largest carbon emitters -- the United States, China and India -- will be represented by ministers or lower-level officials.

The U.S. administration of President Donald Trump, which has announced the intention to withdraw from the Paris agreement, is represented by Marcia Bernicat, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is leading a delegation of Democratic lawmakers to the talks.

More than 5,000 police officers are charged with keeping the summit safe, Spain's Interior Ministry said Sunday. Although authorities have stepped-up border controls and cybersecurity measures, authorities have kept the country's terror alert one level under the highest, where it has been ever since extremist attacks in Tunisia and France in mid-2015.

Los Angeles officials want a state of emergency declared as homelessness crisis worsens,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-29/homeless-emergency-declaration-california-gavin-newsom-shelter-encampment,"Facing a deepening quagmire over homeless encampments, Los Angeles elected officials are increasingly looking to sweeping statewide initiatives to shake loose solutions. The latest proposal from Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and City Councilman Joe Buscaino would have the governor declare a state of emergency on homelessness in California.

Supporters view such a declaration as a novel strategy to free up state and federal funding typically reserved for natural disasters, such as earthquakes or wildfires, and to suspend or streamline the regulatory hurdles that often slow down shelter and housing development. It also could block NIMBY opponents from using environmental reviews to sue and delay or block homeless facilities from opening.

But some question whether an emergency declaration would be merely symbolic, given President Trump’s rejections of more federal funding and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s commitment of $1 billion for local homeless programs and support for more regulatory relief.

Last week, Newsom signed a package of legislation that, among other things, exempts from environmental review supportive housing and shelter projects in the city of L.A. that receive funding from certain public sources, including the $1.2-billion Proposition HHH housing bond measure that voters approved in 2016.

Another new law allows cities in Alameda and Orange counties, in addition to the city of San Jose, to declare a shelter crisis so those local governments can eventually bypass some planning and zoning regulations to expedite construction.

“The governor should not sign a declaration of emergency until the proponents identify the specific laws and regulations they want to get around, and the resources they believe the declaration would free up,” said Gary Blasi, a retired law professor who specializes in homelessness issues. “The state statutes regarding emergencies were not designed to respond to long-standing political, leadership and moral disasters.”

Newsom has not taken a stand on the current request for a state of emergency declaration, and Alex Comisar, spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, said it was “a choice for the governor to make.”

“There are more questions that need to be worked through before he could support something like that,” Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said.

In 2015, City Council members and Garcetti announced that they would declare an emergency locally, but then dropped the idea as the mayor sought a statewide declaration from then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who turned him down.

Then in 2018, Los Angeles declared a shelter crisis, which, along with a legislative change, triggered streamlining of red tape around developing emergency beds on public land.

Many in Los Angeles have been frustrated by the sluggish pace of construction of new shelters and housing for the estimated 44,000 residents in the county, including 27,000 in the city, who live outdoors in tents, cars or lean-tos, as opposed to shelters or other temporary housing. Only 477 emergency shelter beds have been added in the last 2½ years for households without children, which form the bulk of the homeless population, according to an inventory released this month.

Buscaino said he had grown particularly frustrated that even temporary tent shelters on public land had become bogged down in multiple approval processes.

“We’re stopping for every red light, instead of treating this like an emergency,” Buscaino said.

Before a meeting Friday of the governor’s task force on homelessness, headed by Ridley-Thomas and Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, Newsom, in a letter, asked members to prioritize getting people off the streets.

He underscored that local communities must “fully enforce” public safety and health laws, touching on the controversial issue of sanitation sweeps of encampments and other police enforcement. He also asked the task force for proposals to break down barriers to building housing and to get more homeless people into treatment.

Steinberg and Ridley-Thomas are championing a legal right to shelter for California, which would require local governments to provide a bed to every homeless person who wants to move indoors. Steinberg also wants to require homeless people to accept shelter if offered, although how that would be enforced remains a question.

Separately, several local governments — including the city and county of L.A. — and business groups also are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a challenge to a federal appeals court ruling out of Boise, Idaho, that has stopped authorities in Western states from arresting homeless people for sleeping in public when shelter space is unavailable.

“We have a tacit public policy it’s OK to live outdoors,” Steinberg said. “I am strongly pushing for a clear public policy that says as a matter of right people should be living under a roof.”

Newsom has said he is not ready to endorse a legal right to shelter.

“What the governor has said is it’s urgent, let’s get started,” Ridley-Thomas said. “I don’t think anything is dead.”

Before the meeting in Willowbrook on Friday, Ridley-Thomas and Steinberg insisted they were not backing off. But Steinberg repeatedly emphasized that he preferred that people be placed in permanent housing, not a vast shelter system, which critics say could blow the state’s budget without ending homelessness.

“The hard reality is that the governor has already done most of what would be done if a state of emergency was to be called,” said Philip Mangano, the former federal homelessness czar in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations and a member of the governor’s task force. “The governor is the homelessness czar in California and the task force’s job is to give him big ideas to make a difference.”

Homelessness emergency declarations in other parts of the U.S. have a mixed record. Hawaii has issued multiple declarations, the last one in 2018, that have allowed the state to suspend permitting and site restrictions, shaving one to two years off shelter and housing projects, said Scott Morishige, the governor’s coordinator on homelessness.

State homeless numbers overall dropped last year, but the number of unsheltered people on Oahu rose 12%. An emergency declaration “is not a silver bullet by any means,” Morishige said.

In Oregon, Portland and the surrounding Multnomah County used an emergency declaration to relax occupancy rules and zoning for homeless projects.

“Shelters were set up in weeks instead of months or longer,” said Denis Theriault, spokesman for the office of homeless services for Portland and the county.

Theriault said the local homelessness budget also doubled, to $70 million over five years. In January, Multnomah County’s homeless count showed a decline of 4% from 2014, but the number of people living in tents or cars and under bridges was up 22% from the year before.

In California, Steinberg said, what is most important is stating a clear public policy that it is not OK for tens of thousands of people to be living outdoors.

“Everybody has a right to live under a roof — preferably in permanent housing, if necessary in navigation centers,” he said. “It starts with that acknowledgment.”"

"Pandemics result from destruction of nature, say UN and WHO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/17/pandemics-destruction-nature-un-who-legislation-trade-green-recovery,"Pandemics such as coronavirus are the result of humanity’s destruction of nature, according to leaders at the UN, WHO and WWF International, and the world has been ignoring this stark reality for decades.

The illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade as well as the devastation of forests and other wild places were still the driving forces behind the increasing number of diseases leaping from wildlife to humans, the leaders told the Guardian.

Coronavirus is a warning to us to mend our broken relationship with nature | Marco Lambertini, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema and Maria Neira Read more

They are calling for a green and healthy recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular by reforming destructive farming and unsustainable diets.

A WWF report, also published on Wednesday, warns: “The risk of a new [wildlife-to-human] disease emerging in the future is higher than ever, with the potential to wreak havoc on health, economies and global security.”

WWF’s head in the UK said post-Brexit trade deals that fail to protect nature would leave Britain “complicit in increasing the risk of the next pandemic”.

High-level figures have issued a series of warnings since March, with the world’s leading biodiversity experts saying even more deadly disease outbreaks are likely in future unless the rampant destruction of the natural world is rapidly halted.

Earlier in June, the UN environment chief and a leading economist said Covid-19 was an “SOS signal for the human enterprise” and that current economic thinking did not recognise that human wealth depends on nature’s health.

“We have seen many diseases emerge over the years, such as Zika, Aids, Sars and Ebola and they all originated from animal populations under conditions of severe environmental pressures,” said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, head of the UN convention on biological diversity, Maria Neira, the World Health Organization director for environment and health, and Marco Lambertini, head of WWF International, in the Guardian article.

With coronavirus, “these outbreaks are manifestations of our dangerously unbalanced relationship with nature”, they said. “They all illustrate that our own destructive behaviour towards nature is endangering our own health – a stark reality we’ve been collectively ignoring for decades.

“Worryingly, while Covid-19 has given us yet another reason to protect and preserve nature, we have seen the reverse take place. From the Greater Mekong, to the Amazon and Madagascar, alarming reports have emerged of increased poaching, illegal logging and forest fires, while many countries are engaging in hasty environmental rollbacks and cuts in funding for conservation. This all comes at a time when we need it most.

“We must embrace a just, healthy and green recovery and kickstart a wider transformation towards a model that values nature as the foundation for a healthy society. Not doing so, and instead attempting to save money by neglecting environmental protection, health systems, and social safety nets, has already proven to be a false economy. The bill will be paid many times over.”

The WWF report concludes the key drivers for diseases that move from wild animals to humans are the destruction of nature, the intensification of agriculture and livestock production, as well as the trading and consumption of high-risk wildlife.

The report urges all governments to introduce and enforce laws to eliminate the destruction of nature from supply chains of goods and on the public to make their diets more sustainable.

Beef, palm oil and soy are among the commodities frequently linked to deforestation and scientists have said avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way for people to reduce their environmental impact on the planet.

Tanya Steele, the head of WWF UK, said the post-Brexit trade deals must protect nature: “We cannot be complicit in increasing the risk of the next pandemic. We need strong legislation and trade deals that stop us importing food that is the result of rampant deforestation or whose production ignores poor welfare and environmental standards in producer countries. The government has a golden opportunity to make transformative, world-leading change happen.”

The WWF report said 60-70% of the new diseases that have emerged in humans since 1990 came from wildlife. Over the same period, 178m hectares of forest have been cleared, equivalent to more than seven times the area of the UK."
“The US budget deficit is up 27% and getting closer to $1 trillion.” The only way that Trump is accomplishing a pitiful 2.1% GDP growth is by massive borrowing,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/the-us-budget-deficit-is-up-27percent-and-getting-closer-to-1-trillion.html,"The U.S. budget deficit widened another $119.7 billion, good for a 27% increase over a year ago, according to government figures released Monday.

Total outlays increased by 22.8% over last July as receipts grew 11.6%. For the year, receipts were up 3% in the October to July period, totaling $2.86 trillion, while expenditures were at $3.73 trillion, an 8% rise.

That brings the fiscal year deficit through July to $866.8 billion, a little over a year and a half after the Trump administration ushered through a $1.5 trillion tax cut that the White House has vowed would pay for itself. At this point last year, the deficit was $684 billion.

There are two months left in this fiscal year, and the Treasury Department is projecting a deficit of just over $1 trillion.

The monthly rise was in line with Wall Street estimates.

The deficit increase came largely due to increased spending on health care and the military. Medicare outlays rose 11% to $66 billion. Defense spending also was up $10 billion year over year to $53 billion.

A two-year budget deal that Trump negotiated with Congress earlier in August likely will only add to the red ink as the spending plan authorized increased spending on defense and domestic programs.

Though the tax cut lowered the rate corporations have to pay from 36% to 21%, tax receipts actually are up 3.2% year to date. Individual income tax receipts have risen just shy of 1%."

""Averaged as a whole, the global land and ocean surface temperature for March 2020 was 1.16°C (2.09°F) above the 20th century average of 12.7°C (54.9°F) and the second highest in the 141-year record. Only March 2016 was warmer at 1.31°C (2.36°F). The 10 warmest Marches have all occurred since 1990, with Marches of 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 having a global land and ocean surface temperature departure from average above 1.0°C (1.8°F). The March 2020 global land and ocean surface temperature departure tied with February 2020 and December 2015 as the third highest monthly temperature departure from average in the 1,683-month record. Only February and March 2016, when a strong El Niño was present in the tropical Pacific Ocean, had higher temperature departures.

""March 2020 marked the 44th consecutive March and the 423rd consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average. According to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, ENSO-neutral conditions were present across the tropical Pacific Ocean during March 2020. The March 2020 global land and ocean surface temperature departure from average tied with February 2020 as the highest monthly temperature departure without an El Niño present in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The three highest ENSO neutral temperature departures from average have all occurred in 2020. CPC states that ENSO-neutral is favored during the Northern Hemisphere spring (Southern Hemisphere fall). This forecast focuses on the ocean surface temperature between 5°N and 5°S latitude and 170°W to 120°W longitude, called the Niño 3.4 region.

""The global land-only and global ocean-only temperature departures from average for March 2020 were also near-record warm, behind the record set in March 2016. The global land-only March 2020 temperature departure of +2.05°C (+3.69°F) was also the fifth highest for any month for land surfaces in the 1,683-month record. The 10 highest monthly land-only temperature departures have occurred since December 2015. Meanwhile, the March 2020 global ocean-only temperature departure of +0.83°C (+1.49°F) tied with February 2016 and July 2019 as the seventh highest for any month for ocean surface on record.

""Regionally, South America and the Gulf of Mexico had their warmest March on record, surpassing their previous records set in 2010 and 1945, respectively. This was also South America's fifth and the Gulf of Mexico's fourth highest temperature departure for any month in the regional 1,323-month record. The Caribbean had its second highest March on record at 0.90°C (1.62°F) above average. Only March 2016 was warmer. Meanwhile, Europe, Africa, and Asia had a March temperature that ranked among their nine highest on record.""

NOAA/NCEI annual global analysis for 2018:

The 2017 average global temperature across land and ocean surface areas was 0.84°C (1.51°F) above the 20th century average of 13.9°C (57.0°F), behind the record year 2016 (+0.94°C / +1.69°F) and 2015 (+0.90°C / +1.62°F; second warmest year on record) both influenced by a strong El Niño episode. The year 2017 is also the warmest year without an El Niño present in the tropical Pacific Ocean.

2017 also marks the 41st consecutive year (since 1977) with global land and ocean temperatures at least nominally above the 20th century average, with the six warmest years on record occurring since 2010. Since the start of the 21st century, the global temperature has been broken five times, three of those being set back to back (2014–2016). The yearly global land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07°C (0.13°F) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase is twice as great since 1980. From 1900 to 1980 a new temperature record was set on average every 13.5 years; however, since 1981 it has increased to every 3 years.

Overall, the global annual temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07°C (0.13°F) per decade since 1880 and at an average rate of 0.17°C (0.31°F) per decade since 1970.""

[NOAA/NCEI global analysis for 2018 accessed February 18, 2019].

""Globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 shattered the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.23 degrees Fahrenheit (0.13 Celsius). Only once before, in 1998, has the new record been greater than the old record by this much.""

~ NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [NASA post of January 20, 2016]

Before the end of 2015, scientists projected that average global temperature increase for 2015 will exceed 1°C above pre-industrial levels. The years 1850-1900 are used as the pre-industrial baseline by the MET Office and Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the UK. The MET Office released this statement in November 2015:

""This year marks an important first but that doesn't necessarily mean every year from now on will be a degree or more above pre-industrial levels, as natural variability will still play a role in determining the temperature in any given year. As the world continues to warm in the coming decades, however, we will see more and more years passing the 1 degree marker - eventually it will become the norm.""

"""Nature's recovery will exceed the time that humans have existed"" - 50 Million years",https://i.stuff.co.nz/science/114956013/could-take-50-million-years-to-recover-nzs-lost-bird-diversity,"New Zealand bird diversity could take 50 million years to recover from extinctions caused by humans, a new study has found.

""The conservation decisions we make today will have repercussions for millions of years to come,"" says Luis Valente​ of Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin.

""Some people believe that if you leave nature alone it will quickly recuperate, but the reality is that, at least in New Zealand, nature would need several million years to recover from human actions – and perhaps will never really recover.""

The researchers are not saying moa, Haast eagles or huia will re-emerge through evolution.

* Digital species: Unravelling the mysteries of kākāpō through genetics

* Huia-like bird could sing from the branches once again, but what are the limits?

* New research finds Kiwi evolved to cope with nocturnal life

Rather they are saying evolution will eventually produce novel bird species and it will take up to 50m years for the number of different bird species – diversity – to equal the number of bird species that lived on Zealandia prior to human arrival.

""Our study … clearly reveals that the recovery of New Zealand's diversity will not be quick and will, for example, far exceed the amount of time that humans have existed,"" the scientists reported in the journal Current Biology.

""While the number of lost or threatened bird species often has been quantified, the broad-scale evolutionary consequences of human impact on island biodiversity rarely have been measured,"" say the researchers, among them Juan Carlos Garcia-Ramirez of Massey University.

They used statistical tools and techniques to analyse the DNA of existing and extinct NZ birds. Among other things, they calculated the speed at which Zealandia birds diversified before human arrival, as well as their natural extinction rate.

In addition to the 50m year figure, they also predicted it would take 4m years to recover the diversity lost since European arrival and up to 10m years to recover the diversity that is currently under threat if it actually goes extinct.

A closer look at some of the native birds we've come to know and love.

""While the impact of humans on New Zealand's extinct and threatened bird species numbers is relatively well understood, little is known about the long-term macroevolutionary​ impact of anthropogenic extinction,"" the authors wrote. ""In other words, how far have humans perturbed this unique and isolated biological assembly from its natural state?""

""This is an interesting question and concept,"" said Dr Nic Rawlence, a senior lecturer in ancient DNA at the University of Otago, who was not involved in the research.

The researchers excluded migratory, vagrant, marine, and introduced birds.

Excluding introduced birds was interesting because it could be argued that the 37 introduced species have already returned diversity to pre-human levels.

""We didn't count those species because we were interested in the natural processes,"" said Garcia-R in an email.

""Those species were brought to NZ by humans and as such, they don't have the 'equivalent value' for those processes,"" he wrote.

Excluding shore and seabirds was necessary for technical reasons but the researchers predicted their diversity would recover along ""similar"" time periods.

The only other similar study to measure the evolutionary impact of humans on an island system found that 8m years have been lost in Caribbean bats.

The researchers hoped to apply their techniques and tools to other islands globally.

""As conservation funds are limited, measuring the evolutionary time under threat in multiple islands worldwide may contribute to conservation efforts by prioritising the preservation of islands that currently have the most evolutionary history under threat,"" they wrote.

""Our results caution that the policy decisions we make today will have implications far into the future. Luckily, New Zealand's pioneering bird conservation efforts may yet prevent millions of years of evolutionary history from further being lost."""

Global risks report 2020: Our elites are perfectly aware of what's coming,http://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-report-2020/chapter-one-risks-landscape/,"The world cannot wait for the fog of geopolitical and geo-economic uncertainty to lift. Opting to ride out the current period in the hope that the global system will “snap back” runs the risk of missing crucial windows to address pressing challenges. On key issues such as the economy, the environment, technology and public health, stakeholders must find ways to act quickly and with purpose within an unsettled global landscape.

Powerful economic, demographic and technological forces are shaping a new balance of power. The result is an unsettled geopolitical landscape—one in which states are increasingly viewing opportunities and challenges through a unilateral lens. What were once givens regarding alliance structures and multilateral systems no longer hold as states question the value of longstanding frameworks, adopt more nationalist postures in pursuit of individual agendas and weigh the potential geopolitical consequences of economic decoupling.

Beyond the risk of conflict, if stakeholders concentrate on immediate geostrategic advantage and fail to reimagine or adapt mechanisms for coordination during this unsettled period, opportunities for action on key priorities will slip away.

Turbulence: The new normal

For much of the post–Cold War period, all but a few societies shared the aspiration of stable development in the context of formally agreed (if not universally observed) rules governed by multilateral institutions. Geopolitical challenges—from border conflicts to terrorist attacks—were often addressed through cooperative institutions and in ways that sought to minimize interruptions to cooperation for global economic progress. And some have argued that greater economic interconnectedness and interdependence in the last 20 years—fostered by multilateral institutions—has acted as a check on great power conflict.

But new dynamics—in certain cases, underlying forces that are the result of progress over the last three decades—are causing states to re-evaluate their approach to geopolitics. Today’s emerging economies are expected to comprise six of the world’s seven largest economies by 2050. Rising powers are already investing more in projecting influence around the world. And digital technologies are redefining what it means to exert global power. As these trends are unfolding, a shift in mindset is also taking place among some stakeholders—from multilateral to unilateral and from cooperative to competitive. The resulting geopolitical turbulence is one of unpredictability about who is leading, who are allies, and who will end up the winners and losers.

As states respond to the challenges and opportunities offered by today’s epochal power-shift, some view multilateral institutions as obstacles rather than instruments for promoting their interests. The challenge to these institutions is rooted in concern within some societies about globalized systems and mechanisms of cooperation—what the International Monetary Fund (IMF) dubs a “trust recession”. According to the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer, just one in five people believe “the system” is working for them.

Expanding geopolitical frontiers

The current period of geopolitical change presents opportunities—for instance, to re-evaluate frameworks in which some stakeholders have been under-represented. Yet the turbulence threatens to undermine the international community’s ability to mitigate critical global risks by multiplying the domains in which rivalries can play out and limiting stakeholders’ capacity to address global challenges. Unless stakeholders can adapt to the present—while still preparing for the future—time will run out to address some of the most pressing economic, environmental and technological challenges.

The economic frontier

The global economy is showing signs of vulnerability (see Chapter 2, The Fraying Fundamentals). At the time of writing, the IMF expected growth to be 3.0% in 2019—the lowest rate since the economic crisis of 2008-2009. At a time when global coordination in the form of more efficient trade could help boost growth, trade has instead been turned into an instrument for rivalry. The World Trade Organization (WTO) projected that growth in merchandise trade will slow to 1.2% in 2019 from 3.0% in 2018.

While there was progress late last year towards a “Phase One” US-China trade deal, tensions between the two have harmed the economies of both countries and the global economic outlook as well: the tensions could cost US$700 billion in lost output in 2020 —almost the amount of GDP lost by the entire European Union due to the financial crisis (US$757 billion between 2008 and 2009). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warns, “Escalating trade conflicts are taking an increasing toll on confidence and investment, adding to policy uncertainty, aggravating risks in financial markets and endangering already weak growth prospects worldwide.” Respondents to the Global Risks Perception Survey do not expect overall economic tensions to cease—over 78% of them see “economic confrontations” increasing in 2020 (see Figure 1.1).

Note: The Global Shapers Community is the World Economic Forum’s network of young people driving dialogue, action and change.

The environmental frontier

In late 2019, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that a “point of no-return” on climate change is “in sight and hurtling toward us”. Respondents to the Forum’s Global Risks Perception Survey also are sounding the alarm. For the first time in the history of the survey, climate-related issues dominated all of the top-five long-term risks by likelihood among members of the Forum’s multistakeholder community (see Figure 1.2). And members of the Global Shapers Community—the Forum’s younger constituents—show even more concern, ranking environmental issues as the top risks in both the short and long terms (see Figure III, The Global Shapers Risk Landscape).

Source: World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey 2019-2020. See Appendix B for details.

Yet, although immediate multilateral and multistakeholder coordination is needed to address global warming (see Chapter 3, A Decade Left, and Chapter 4, Save the Axolotl), global fracture—most recently exhibited at the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid—and a growth in nationalist policies risk preventing meaningful action.

States are adapting to one of the most dramatic effects of climate change—the melting of Arctic ice—not by redoubling efforts to prevent further environmental degradation, but by exploiting the region for geostrategic advantage. The Arctic Council, which for more than 20 years has served as an important multilateral mechanism for collaboration among the eight Arctic States, is under stress. A new cold war is developing as countries—including China, Norway, Russia and the United States—compete for fish, gas and other natural resources; for the use of new shipping lanes; and to establish a strategic footprint in the region. Russia and China have prioritized developing the Northern Sea Route, with the latter dubbing its initiative the “Polar Silk Road”. The U.S. Department of Defense released its Arctic strategy in July; that document did not mention climate change but did present a strategy in which the “end-state for the Arctic is a secure and stable region in which U.S. national security interests are safeguarded.”

The digital frontier

Both sets of respondents to the Global Risks Perception Survey—the multistakeholder community and the Global Shapers—identify cyber-related issues, such as cyberattacks and data fraud or theft, within the list of top 10 long-term risks (see Figure 1.2). Indeed, while the growth of digitalization offers opportunities that can best be captured through coordinated approaches among stakeholders, it also creates areas in need of coordinated solutions.

One such area is artificial intelligence (AI). According to the UN’s International Telecommunication Union, it will take “massive interdisciplinary collaboration” to unlock AI’s potential. But because AI can also bring significant risk, multilateral cooperation is needed to address challenges such as security, verification, “deepfake” videos, mass surveillance and advanced weaponry.

Despite the need for a common set of global protocols, AI has become a new frontier for competitive geopolitics. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” China has strongly encouraged companies to invest in AI, making it a national security priority ; AI is a pillar of its current five-year plan (2016–2020) for science and technology development and its “made in China 2025” industrial plan. In the United States, the Defense Department’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center recently requested that its budget be tripled to US$268 million, citing the rapid development of AI capabilities by China and Russia as a reason for urgency.

There is some progress. Already, stakeholders are coming together to design shared protocols for AI. The World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution has worked with the government of the United Kingdom to formulate guidelines for more ethical and efficient procurement of AI. These guidelines will be piloted in countries across Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. And, in May 2019, the OECD’s 36 member states adopted Principles on AI—the first common set of principles that governments have adopted—to promote AI “that is innovative and trustworthy and that respects human rights and democratic values.” However, challenges remain. Eleonore Pauwels of the United Nations University Centre for Policy Research warns that “the resurgence of nationalist agendas across the world may point to a dwindling capacity of the multilateral system to play a meaningful role in the global governance of AI.”

A coming decoupling?

Geopolitical turbulence related to trade tensions and technological rivalries is part of a larger risk for the global community—the risk of the United States and China decoupling. Together, these two countries account for over 40% of global GDP, and they are the world’s leading innovators. They are also the world’s top two emitters of greenhouse gases. Expanding the global economy, addressing climate change and realizing the full benefits of technology, therefore, depend on their ability to coordinate as part of a common global system that is capable of including other stakeholders.

However, the trend today is not one in which these two countries are just competing across common domains but one in which each is looking to design its own systems—its own supply chains, 5G networks and global investment institutions. Already investment flows between the two have dropped, each has moved to restrict technology from the other, and some analysts predict China will look to reduce its dependence on the US dollar by holding more foreign currencies.

Even if the current trade tensions cool, we risk heading towards an era in which the two countries disentangle their economies and create barriers between one another. While leaders in Beijing and Washington have expressed disapproval of an economic decoupling, the policy measures being put in place are paving a road towards that destination.

A return to a kind of cold war or iron curtain economic landscape would fundamentally change the way in which global business and security have functioned over the past three decades. Countries would need to decide which economic system to be part of—something many have already said they do not want to do—and businesses would have to develop separate protocols.

The decline of economic integration would also remove what many see as a check against outright conflict.

A need for adaptive geopolitics

As the outlines of the next geopolitical era start to emerge, there is still uncertainty about where the distribution of power will settle and from where influence will emanate, but a snap back to the old order appears unlikely. If stakeholders attempt to bide their time, waiting for the old system to return, they will be ill-prepared for what lies ahead and may miss the point at which key challenges—economic, societal, technological or environmental—can be addressed. Instead, longstanding institutions must adapt to the present and be upgraded or reimagined for the future.

There are signs of adaptation in the creation of new institutions designed to function in this turbulent geopolitical climate. One example is the Franco-German “Alliance for Multilateralism”, a group of nations working to boost international cooperation in areas such as disarmament, digitalization and climate change. Another is the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, which will bring together the 55 member states of the African Union to form the largest free trade area since the formation of the WTO. Narrower, issue-specific, ad-hoc “coalitions of the willing” are proliferating—including Asian regional trade and investment instruments, the “Quad” (consultation among Australia, India, Japan and the United States), and the Global Coalition against Daesh. While aiming to address collective priorities, however, such adaptive approaches run the risk of being less effective because they lack the legitimacy of broad-based multilateral institutions. Still, they point to the need for continued coordination and partnership during an unsettled time."

PLANET PLASTIC - How Big Oil and Big Soda kept a global environmental calamity a secret for decades,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/plastic-problem-recycling-myth-big-oil-950957/,"Every human on Earth is ingesting nearly 2,000 particles of plastic a week. These tiny pieces enter our unwitting bodies from tap water, food, and even the air, according to an alarming academic study sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, dosing us with five grams of plastics, many cut with chemicals linked to cancers, hormone disruption, and developmental delays. Since the paper’s publication last year, Sen. Tom Udall, a plain-spoken New Mexico Democrat with a fondness for white cowboy hats and turquoise bolo ties, has been trumpeting the risk: “We are consuming a credit card’s worth of plastic each week,” Udall says. At events with constituents, he will brandish a Visa from his wallet and declare, “You’re eating this, folks!”

With new legislation, the Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act of 2020, Udall is attempting to marshal Washington into a confrontation with the plastics industry, and to force companies that profit from plastics to take accountability for the waste they create. Unveiled in February, the bill would ban many single-use plastics and force corporations to finance “end of life” programs to keep plastic out of the environment. “We’re going back to that principle,” the senator tells Rolling Stone. “The polluter pays.”

The battle pits Udall and his allies in Congress against some of the most powerful corporate interests on the planet, including the oil majors and chemical giants that produce the building blocks for our modern plastic world — think Exxon, Dow, and Shell — and consumer giants like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Unilever that package their products in the stuff. Big Plastic isn’t a single entity. It’s more like a corporate supergroup: Big Oil meets Big Soda — with a puff of Big Tobacco, responsible for trillions of plastic cigarette butts in the environment every year. And it combines the lobbying and public-relations might of all three.

Americans have occasionally crusaded against “problem plastics” — scapegoating packing peanuts, grocery bags, or drinking straws for the sins of our unsustainable consumer economy. We’ve been slow to recognize that we’re actually in the midst of a plastic pandemic. Over the past 70 years, we’ve gotten hooked on disposable goods and packaging — as plastics became the lifeblood of an American culture of speed, convenience, and disposability that’s conquered the globe. Plastic contains our hot coffee and frozen dinners. It is the material of childhood, from Pampers to Playmobil to PlayStation 4. It cloaks our e-commerce purchases and is woven into our sneakers, fast fashion, and business fleece. Humans are now using a million plastic bottles a minute, and 500 billion plastic bags a year — including those we use to bag up our plastic-laden trash.

But the world’s plastic waste is not so easily contained. Massive quantities of this forever material are spilling into the oceans — the equivalent of a dump-truck load every minute. Plastic is also fouling our mountains, our farmland, and spiraling into an unmitigatable environmental disaster. John Hocevar is a marine biologist who leads the Oceans Campaign for Greenpeace, and spearheaded the group’s response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf. Increasingly, his work has centered on plastics. “This is a much bigger problem than ‘just’ an ocean issue, or even a pollution issue,” he says. “We’ve found plastic everywhere we’ve ever looked. It’s in the Arctic and the Antarctic and in the middle of the Pacific. It’s in the Pyrenees and in the Rockies. It’s settling out of the air. It’s raining down on us.”

More than half the plastic now on Earth has been created since 2002, and plastic pollution is on pace to double by 2030. At its root, the global plastics crisis is a product of our addiction to fossil fuels. The private profit and public harm of the oil industry is well understood: Oil is refined and distributed to consumers, who benefit from gasoline’s short, useful lifespan in a combustion engine, leaving behind atmospheric pollution for generations. But this same pattern — and this same tragedy of the commons — is playing out with another gift of the oil-and-gas giants, whose drilling draws up the petroleum precursors for plastics. These are refined in industrial complexes and manufactured into bottles, bags, containers, textiles, and toys for consumers who benefit from their transient use — before throwing them away.

“Plastics are just a way of making things out of fossil fuels,” says Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network. BAN is devoted to enforcement of the Basel Convention, an international treaty that blocks the developed world from dumping hazardous wastes on the developing world, and was recently expanded, effective next year, to include plastics. For Americans who religiously sort their recycling, it’s upsetting to hear about plastic being lumped in with toxic waste. But the poisonous parallel is apt. When it comes to plastic, recycling is a misnomer. “They really sold people on the idea that plastics can be recycled because there’s a fraction of them that are,” says Puckett. “It’s fraudulent. When you drill down into plastics recycling, you realize it’s a myth.”

Since 1950, the world has created 6.3 trillion kilograms of plastic waste — and 91 percent has never been recycled even once, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances. Unlike aluminum, which can be recycled again and again, plastic degrades in reprocessing, and is almost never recycled more than once. A plastic soda bottle, for example, might get downcycled into a carpet. Modern technology has hardly improved things: Of the 78 billion kilograms of plastic packaging materials produced in 2013, only 14 percent were even collected for recycling, and just two percent were effectively recycled to compete with virgin plastic. “Recycling delays, rather than avoids, final disposal,” the Science authors write. And most plastics persist for centuries.

As the globalized economy boomed, the toxic reality was hidden overseas. Plastics tossed out here were picked over at domestic recycling facilities, which targeted easier-to-sort-and-reprocess clear plastic bottles, milk jugs, and detergent containers. The leftovers were tied up in dirty bales and shipped to Asia. “China took them because there was some high value of material in there,” a former Waste Management executive tells Rolling Stone. Oftentimes, he says, Chinese recyclers “would dump those bales into the river to separate the materials and pick the better stuff out. And then they simply let the rest just go downstream.” The target plastics weren’t recycled in state-of-the-art facilities, rather shredded and melted down in rudimentary factories — often staffed by whole families, children included — eking out a toxic living amid mountains of imported trash.

Seeing political danger in its growing pollution crisis, China blocked most plastic imports in 2018, and this “National Sword” policy roiled international recycling markets. Attempts to re-create the China model in less authoritarian economies of Southeast Asia have backfired in pollution and protest — pulling back the curtain on what one waste executive describes to Rolling Stone as “our dirty little secret”: Americans who believed they were diverting plastic from the trash were, ironically, fueling a waste crisis half a world away. “It is easy to find American and European packaging polluting the countryside of Southeast Asia,” states a 2019 report from the Break Free From Plastics coalition, which coordinates an annual global audit of plastic waste. “When people in the global north throw something ‘away,’ much of it ends up in the global south because there is no such thing as ‘away.’”

The worst of our global plastics crisis is borne by the oceans. Roughly 8 billion kilograms of plastics enter the world’s waters every year, and the problem is most acute in emerging coastal economies. The volume entering oceans can be hard to comprehend, admits Jenna Jambeck, an engineering professor at the University of Georgia who has published pathbreaking science that quantifies plastic “leakage” to the oceans. “It’s equal to five grocery-size bags full of plastic for every foot of coastline in the world,” she says. “If you imagine us all standing, hand-to-hand, covering the coastline of the entire world, this is what’s in front of each one of us.”

Marine plastics picked up by the currents collect in massive ocean “gyres” — the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is now twice the size of Texas. These are swirling petrochemical spills, but unlike crude oil, the long molecular chains in plastics don’t exist in nature and don’t meaningfully biodegrade. “The same properties that make plastics so versatile,” the Science Advances authors, including Jambeck, write, “make these materials difficult or impossible for nature to assimilate.” Instead, bulk plastics wear down into microplastics — a category for particles smaller than 5 millimeters, or roughly the width of your pinkie fingernail — deteriorating further into nanoplastic particles.

In the open water, plastics are consumed by fish, seabirds, and mammals — which are washing up dead in harrowing numbers. Last year, whales in Italy and the Philippines died just weeks apart, their stomachs packed with indigestible plastic bags. In December, a sperm whale washed ashore in Scotland with more than 200 pounds of plastic in its gut. The pollution visible on the ocean surface represents just one percent of what humans have dumped into the oceans. The rest lies beneath, including seven miles deep in the Mariana Trench, where researchers have spotted plastic bags and measured microplastics at concentrations of 2,000 parts per liter. Without dramatic change, the amount of plastics entering the oceans every year, already intolerable, is projected to more than double by 2025.

The story on dry land is hardly more comforting. Plastics are widely used in agriculture and “microplastic pollution is somewhere between four and 23 times higher in the soil than in the sea,” says Lili Fuhr, editor of Plastic Atlas, which documents the reach of global plastic pollution. Microplastics, thought to be carried by the winds, have been found in pristine terrestrial environments, including the polar ice caps. In Colorado, plastic fibers have been discovered in precipitation. “It’s in the rain, it’s in the snow,” lamented United States Geological Survey researcher Greg Wetherbee. “It’s a part of our environment now.” Even landfills may be creating long-term hazards. A 2019 study in Water Research found microplastic contamination as high as 24 parts per liter in landfill runoff, offering “preliminary evidence…that landfill isn’t the final sink of plastics,” the researchers wrote, “but a potential source of microplastics.”

This pollution is planetwide, impossible to fully remediate, and threatens to disrupt natural systems — including those that allow the oceans to remove carbon from the atmosphere. “Humans are conducting a singular uncontrolled experiment on a global scale,” write the researchers in Science Advances, “in which billions of metric tons of material will accumulate across all major terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the planet.”

We are all guinea pigs in this experiment, as plastics accumulate in the food web, appearing in seafood, table salt, and ironically even in bottled water. Many plastics are mixed with a toxic brew of colorants, flame retardants, and plasticizers. Joe Vaillancourt is the CEO of a company that refines waste plastic into fuel — a process that requires removing such contaminants from curbside recycling. “In one little 10-pound batch,” he says, “we found a thousand different chemicals.” Some of these additives are linked to cancer and severe health problems. As plastics break down over time, they can also absorb toxins from the environment, including PCBs.

The threat to human health is complex and poorly understood. “There are a lot more questions than answers at this point,” says Mark Hahn, a toxicologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who studies microplastics. Some plastic likely passes through the human gut like so much sand, he says. But scientists have found that tiny plastic particles can insinuate themselves into the bloodstream of mussels and the organs of fish. Airborne nanoplastics can also be inhaled into the lungs. “Are they lodging somewhere and physically blocking something, or causing an inflammatory reaction,” Hahn asks, “or are they carrying their additives and contaminants and delivering them somewhere — you know, to the brain?” Hahn, a sober and skeptical scientist, is concerned about the rising tide of plastic in the environment. “If there is a problem now,” he says, “it’s only going to get worse.”

The story of how we got into this fix is short, modern — and American as hell. In the late 1860s, a bush-bearded inventor in New York sought to claim a $10,000 prize by developing an alternative to ivory. With a primitive polymer, John Wesley Hyatt created — and later peddled to the consuming public — plastic billiard balls, piano keys, and false teeth.

Plastics were industrialized in the early 1900s by Leo Baekeland, a Belgian immigrant whose Bakelite polymer withstood high temperatures and insulated against electricity. Touted as “the material of a thousand uses” — its logo a “B” floating above the mathematical symbol for infinity — Bakelite became integral to the automotive and electric industries, as well as to consumer goods like dominoes, telephone receivers, and 78 rpm records.

Plastics wove themselves deeper into American life with the invention of nylon in the 1930s. And their versatility made them indispensable to the military in World War II, featuring in parachutes, tires, and Plexiglas windows. Plastics boomed as a hallmark of America’s postwar consumer culture, yet this material of abundance also became a marker of soulless excess that horrified Dustin Hoffman’s character in The Graduate when buttonholed about his future career prospects at a party — and pitched on “Plastics…There’s a great future in plastics.”

The virtues of plastic are as real now as they were then. “Plastic allows us to do more with less,” insists Steve Russell, vice president of the Plastics Division at the American Chemistry Council, which represents petrochemical companies. (Russell announced his retirement in early 2020.) “Whether it’s to make cars lighter so they use less energy or buildings more efficient. They allow us to deliver a safe and sanitary drinking water through plastic pipes that don’t corrode.” Pointing to the pervasive use of plastics in medicine, he highlights their peerless “benefits of hygiene and health and safety.”

Yet beyond this slate of essential, durable, or technically demanding cases, plastic has also twinned itself to modern throwaway culture. As much as 40 percent of plastics produced today go into packaging. The Graduate debuted in 1967, and that era marks a pivot point for the industry. At the First National Conference of Packaging Wastes in 1969, Dow Chemical’s chief environmental manager presented a paper on the explosive growth of single-use plastics in “cafeterias…universities, hospitals, airlines, restaurants, etc.” While praising the performance of these “durable materials that might conceivably last forever,” he sounded an alarm about “disposal problems.” He foresaw a coming deluge of plastic waste and called out the industry for turning a blind eye — “and there are those who have elected to do just that.” He insisted that incineration was the “ultimate solution,” but confessed, “It’s going to cost somebody a lot of money.”

Far from financing a solution for plastic waste, the broader corporate response was to fund public relations blaming consumers for the pollution instead. Keep America Beautiful — a nonprofit quietly funded by industry — began airing famous public-service announcements in 1971 of a crying “Indian” (actually a spaghetti-Western star) paddling through waters strewn with refuse like styrofoam cups, with the tag line “People start pollution. People can stop it.”

In fact, KAB had been founded to head off state bans on single-use packaging, according to notes reviewed by Rolling Stone. And industry boosters from the era were proclaiming the end of refillable beer and soda bottles as a “growth frontier” because every reusable bottle taken out of circulation “means the sale of 20 one-way containers.” By 1978, Coca-Cola adopted its first plastic soda bottle — sparking a shift that has conquered the planet. Four decades later, the world is using half a trillion plastic bottles a year.

To help keep pollution out of sight, the top companies of Big Plastic have continued to fund KAB, which organizes volunteer labor to pick up trash on land, as well as the Ocean Conservancy, which sponsors volunteer international coastal cleanups. Since 2017, the top 10 categories of trash collected in the beach cleanups has been made of one material: plastic.

Ocean Conservancy says it is dedicated to “ending the flow of trash at the source,” but critics accuse the group of a sin of omission. The cleanups tally waste down to the last plastic bottle (1,754,908 in the most recent effort), but don’t link the waste to the corporations that produced it. Only in recent years has Break Free From Plastics launched a competing network of cleanups, recording the branding they discover. In 2019, its audit called out a trio of the world’s richest consumer brands as the top plastic polluters: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé. “I was personally saddened by it,” says Bea Perez, Coca-Cola’s chief sustainability officer, of the company’s number-one ranking. “We don’t want to be that number.”

Both KAB and Ocean Conservancy insist their work is not compromised by corporate funding. A representative for KAB — whose directors include executives from Keurig, Dr. Pepper, Mars Wrigley, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé Waters, Dow, Philip Morris, and the American Chemistry Council — rejects the “narrative” that KAB is a corporate front group: “We’re not. We’re an independent organization.” A vice president at Ocean Conservancy — which placed executives from Coca-Cola, Dow, and the American Chemistry Council on the steering committee of a recent report on ocean plastics — tells Rolling Stone that the problems of plastic waste are so systemic and complex that “we need everyone — including corporations — at the table.”

I’m peering down from a crane operator’s chair on the third floor of a waste-to-energy facility — into what looks like a real-life version of the trash compactor in the Death Star.

Far below lies a rectangular pit, 35 feet deep, where municipal garbage trucks dump their loads. The trash there awaits “the claw” — a 7,500-pound grapple with six retractable steel talons that scoops up to two-and-a-half tons of garbage on every lift. The operator next to me hoists trash out of the pit, releasing it onto a mountainous mixing pile, “fluffing” the waste to create a blend that will burn evenly. With each pass, the grapple pops Glad bags like pustules of trash, leaving behind ragged streamers of plastic.

The top alternative to burying plastic in a landfill is not recycling. It’s fire. Over the past six decades, far more plastic has been incinerated than collected for reuse. This incinerator, outside of Oregon’s capital, Salem, is operated by Covanta, which runs similar waste-to-energy plants on the East Coast that burn trash for New York and Philadelphia. For months after China roiled recycling markets in 2018, Philadelphia tasked Covanta with burning half the city’s “recycling” that had nowhere else to go.

Roughly a third of the trash is plastic. Households served by this plant have recently been instructed to toss out hard-to-recycle plastics (yogurt containers, beer cups — anything with a recycling number higher than 2), and those items now come here to burn. When the operator is satisfied with the mix, he hoists a grapple load to a height of 90 feet and dumps it into the hopper — fueling the incinerator that generates electricity for the local grid. The extreme temperature of the burner, 2,000 degrees, creates a near-complete combustion that neutralizes most toxic compounds in plastic. But incineration returns plastic to its origins as a fossil fuel, creating carbon pollution that escapes through a candy-striped smokestack, in a white wisp that’s visible for miles.

The greenhouse-gas profile of plastics is simply unsustainable. As the world begins to wean itself off of fossil fuel for transportation, Big Oil giants from Texas to Saudi Arabia are turning to plastic to support future growth. The International Energy Agency predicts that “oil demand related to plastic consumption overtakes that for road-passenger transport by 2050,” and its top executive warns plastics are “one of the key blind spots in the global energy debate.”

The industry is counting on a tidal wave of new demand from emerging economies. A 2018 IEA report underscores that advanced economies use up to 20 times more plastic per capita than consumers do in India or Indonesia. And it warns that increased recycling and single-use bans in places like Europe and Japan “will be far outweighed by developing economies sharply increasing their shares of plastic consumption (as well as its disposal).”

Global plastics production and incineration currently creates the CO2 pollution of 189 coal plants. By 2050, that’s expected to more than triple, to the equivalent of 615 coal plants. At that rate, plastics would hog about 15 percent of the world’s remaining “carbon budget,” or what can be emitted without crossing the 2-degrees Celsius threshold in global temperature rise that scientists warn can trigger calamity.

The plastic industry’s damage to the planet is vast, but not immeasurable. In fact, the industry has published a detailed accounting that reveals its pollution is on pace to cause trillions in environmental harm by midcentury.

The American Chemistry Council is a trade group that represents the large oil and petrochemical companies that produce plastic resins — the back end of Big Plastic. In 2016, the ACC commissioned a study by the consultancy Trucost — “the world’s leading experts in quantifying and valuing the environmental impacts” from industry. The ACC paid for the study to demonstrate that plastics are not easily replaceable, and that many common substitutes — particularly glass — carry higher environmental costs when factoring in weight for transportation.

The Trucost finding that the ACC does not trumpet? “The environmental cost to society of consumer plastic products and packaging was over $139 billion in 2015,” the report reveals. Without a dramatic change in course, Trucost predicts, that annual figure will soar to “$209 billion by 2025.”

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Steve Russell, the ACC’s vice president for plastics, acknowledged that $139 billion “is a big number.” An attorney, Russell has an affect more folksy than slick. But that’s far from straightforward. The giant sum, he says, is “not a literal debt on the balance sheet.” But that is precisely the point. Trucost measured externalities — or the costs that companies don’t have to pay for, but instead slough off on society — including those created by “greenhouse-gas emissions; air pollution; land and water pollution; water depletion; [and] ocean impacts.”

Trucost warns that the business model of the plastics industry would be upended if new government regulations, or consumer backlash, forced it to “internalize” and pay for these costs — a development that would pose “a serious risk to the future profitability of the plastics industry.”

Much of the world is waking up to the plastics crisis. As China has shut its doors to the global plastic-waste trade, the European Union, Canada, and India are stepping up bans on single-use plastics like cutlery, plates, straws, and ear swabs. “How do you explain dead whales washing up on beaches across the world, their stomachs jam packed with plastic bags?” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked, introducing his country’s initiative. “As a dad, it is tough trying to explain this stuff to my kids.”

But under President Trump, the United States is lurching in the opposite direction, promoting the plastic industry’s aggressive expansion. “It’s war,” says Puckett of BAN, “between policies that are totally at odds with each other — of making more plastics and banning plastic.”

American fracking is literally fueling the global surge in plastics. The glut of cheap natural gas here has sparked an explosion in new plastics infrastructure. Since 2010, according to the ACC, U.S. companies have ramped up “334 chemical and plastics projects cumulatively valued at $204 billion.” Europe has built new plastics plants fed by fracked U.S. exports. Environmentalists warn that these facilities will lock in demand for fossil-fuel consumption for a generation.

Trump is an unabashed booster of plastics — in keeping with his service to the fossil-fuel industry. The former CEO of Dow led Trump’s manufacturing council. And last July, the president visited a new Shell plastics complex outside Pittsburgh. “This facility will transform abundant natural gas — and we have a lot of it — fracked from Pennsylvania wells into plastic,” Trump said. That material, he boasted, would be embossed with “that very beautiful phrase: ‘Made in the USA.’”

With the president championing its interests in Washington — and even triggering the libs with Trump 2020 campaign-branded plastic straws — the plastics industry is working to undermine grassroots activism in cities and states across the country.

The Plastics Industry Association, or PLASTICS, is a top trade group headquartered on K Street in Washington, D.C. Hiding its handiwork inside a nesting doll of front groups, PLASTICS has worked to thwart state and municipal bans on single-use plastics. PLASTICS has gotten an assist from the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, which pushes right-wing state legislatures to pass nearly identical bills. In 2013, the plastic trade group wrote a pitch to ALEC members, arguing a ban on plastic “results in the picking of winners and losers in a ‘not-so-free’ marketplace.” By 2015, ALEC began advocating state laws best known for “banning bans” on plastic bags, but which are often far more sweeping, prohibiting limits on styrofoam and “auxiliary containers” — a catchall term for to-go packaging.

PLASTICS obscures its involvement in these state fights through a “special purpose” front group called the Progressive Bag Alliance, which rebranded in January as the American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance. The organization runs public relations through another front group, Bag the Ban, which touts plastic as “the most environmentally friendly option at the checkout.” (The bag alliance claims it is self-funding, but PLASTICS employs its director, per IRS filings, and the groups share offices and overhead.)

Plastic bags get caught in trees and clog gutters, and for cities they’re an obvious target for regulation. “They’re a visible reminder of consumer single-use culture, and something that people feel like they can do something about,” says Jennie Romer, an environmental lawyer who built PlasticBagLaws.org and now directs plastic-pollution projects for Surfrider. Banning bags is often the first step in a radicalizing journey, says Romer, as consumers become vigilant about the harms of single-use plastics more broadly. “Plastic-bag laws have been a gateway to other laws on plastics,” she says. San Jose, for example, passed a 2011 ban on bags that spawned a statewide California ban, later defended by voters in a 2016 referendum the Bag Alliance spent more than $6 million to put on the ballot. Last year, California nearly passed a ban on single-use plastics. “I don’t think we get there,” Romer says, “unless we can start with the plastic bags.”

The success of blue states, from Hawaii to New York, in banning plastic bags has been countered by the industry-led push. PLASTICS says it has parted ways with ALEC, but some 15 red states now have laws pre-empting local plastic bans, with Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Tennessee joining the pack in 2019. (ALEC did not respond to questions from Rolling Stone.)

For now, the state bans on bans are holding up in court. The city of Coral Gables, adjacent to Miami, has seen a pair of ordinances struck down under Florida’s plastics pre-emption law, and Mayor Raúl Valdés-Fauli is furious. “We have 200 miles of coastline,” he tells Rolling Stone. “We banned plastic bags. We also banned styrofoam. We’re going onto plastic straws. It’s vital for us to prevail on these in order to preserve our environment.” Coral Gables is taking the fight to the state Supreme Court.

Florida’s powerful Retail Federation insists it shouldn’t have to contend with a patchwork of local regulations. But Romer sees a darker motivation at play. “It’s hard to change a statewide law,” she says, “if you don’t have the ability to work locally.” By striking in statehouses, she adds, “the industry is able to kill the grassroots movements.”

As the global plastics crisis grows — and photos of albatross chicks decomposing around the indigestible plastic waste that killed them go viral — the industry is quietly agonizing over backlash from the metal-straw and Hydroflask-toting members of Generation Z. “The [plastic] water bottle has, in some way, become the mink coat or the pack of cigarettes,” a senior sustainability manager for Nestlé Waters confessed at a conference last year. “It’s socially not very acceptable to the young folks, and that scares me.”

In contrast to climate change, the plastics crisis has not been met with corporate denial. The companies of Big Plastic are instead seeking to convince consumers and regulators that — despite having unleashed this torrent of pollution on the planet — they can be trusted to pioneer solutions that will make plastic use sustainable. They’re touting a “circular economy,” in which used plastic doesn’t become waste but, instead, a feedstock for new products. A cynic might translate the concept into: Recycling, but for real this time. “There are a lot of different corporate commitments,” says Shilpi Chhotray, a leader of the Break Free From Plastics movement. While some show promise, others “are just greenwashing,” she insists, with the intent of giving the industry cover for its true aim: “growth.”

There’s a marked split in the seriousness of the industry response between the back-end producers of plastics and the consumer brands closest to the backlash. On the producer side, the American Chemistry Council has taken on a global role in crisis management. It has adopted voluntary commitments that give its members decades to change habits. ACC members have pledged to make all plastic packaging “recyclable or recoverable” by 2030, aiming for this material to be “reused, recycled, or recovered” in practice by 2040. “They’re very ambitious,” the ACC’s Russell insisted of the goals. “There was a lot of heartburn in articulating them, because we didn’t know that we could go that quickly.”

Yet even as it promotes “the drive toward a circular economy,” the ACC is also championing technology that turns waste-plastic back into fossil fuels, including diesel. The ACC calls this “advanced recycling.” Puckett, the BAN chief, calls that malarkey: “They’re going to try and market burning plastic as some kind of green coal,” he warns.

The ACC also helped launch the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Its members are primarily producers — ExxonMobil, Shell, Dow, Total, BASF — but also include Procter & Gamble. Like many consumer brands, P&G is targeting emerging economies by selling single-serve plastic packets of soaps and detergents. These “sachets” are unrecyclable and a top form of trash in plastic waste in Asia. Alliance members are vowing to spend $1.5 billion over five years to “minimize and manage plastic waste…to keep it out of the environment.” Large on its face, this $1.5 billion commitment represents a fraction of the damage the industry is causing to the oceans in a single year — $13 billion, per the United Nations. And a pilot project to keep plastics out of the Ganges relies in part on distributing equipment to turn waste into fuel. No one from the Alliance would speak to Rolling Stone. But the ACC’s Russell admitted that “$1.5 billion is not enough,” emphasizing, “It’s a start. It’s not the end.”

A more ambitious initiative comes from the consumer-facing brands of Big Plastic. The New Plastic Economy is run through the London-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation and supported by corporate giants like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Unilever, as well as the U.N. Environmental Program. Remarkably, the project has gotten plastic-dependent companies to reveal for the first time just how much they use each year. The tallies are staggering, led by Coca-Cola at 3 billion kilograms, PepsiCo at 2.3 billion, Nestlé at 1.7 billion, and Unilever at 700 million.

The New Plastic Economy’s goals include eliminating some problem plastics, committing to a 2025 “ambition level” of 100 percent “reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic packaging.” Sander Defruyt, the project’s leader, is quick to call bullshit on plastics-to-fuel initiatives — “that’s not recycling,” he says, “and it is not part of a circular economy” — and admits that project members have shown “an enormous lack of progress” on pioneering essential models for reuse. He insists the world cannot recycle its way out of this problem. The circular economy is “not about keeping today’s system and increasing the recycling rate,” he says. “It’s about fundamentally changing the system.”

No company stands astride the currents of the global plastic crisis quite like Coca-Cola. The company’s plastic dependence is stark. It produced 117 billion plastic bottles in 2018, according to its sustainability report. The company boasts a 52 percent recycling rate for these bottles — far above average. But the same math indicates that more than 56 billion of its bottles became waste. That’s roughly seven containers for every human on the planet.

Coca-Cola recently ended its membership in the Plastics Industry Association — “our values did not align,” Perez, the company’s chief sustainability officer, tells Rolling Stone. It has also committed to its own World Without Waste initiative, vowing to “collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells globally” by 2030.

Perez’s brief is expansive: She also serves as the company’s chief of communications, public affairs, and marketing assets. Coca-Cola’s sustainability initiatives likewise seem nested within a marketing context. In a recent investor presentation, the company was pressed on whether young people adopting refillable flasks was a threat to the bottom line: “What’s interesting,” Perez replied, “is the more educated they become around the circular economy and turning it into something else, the more receptive they become” to plastic.

Coca-Cola deflected questions about switching to a material like aluminum that has more intrinsic value and is less hazardous as waste. Perez highlights, instead, the company’s efforts to make its plastic bottles lighter and easier to recycle. Leaving open that the “bottle of the future” might be made of a “more responsible” material, Perez insists that plastic is “a viable package as long as we get to the circular economy.” But getting there, she adds, will take coordinated global action. “We’re going to act, and we’re going to ask others to join us. We need everyone to play the part,” she insists, “because time is running out.”

Across the plastics industry, executives buzz about the potential of “chemical recycling” — a process that breaks down plastic to its molecular components, which can then be reprocessed to make like-new plastic. “We could truly keep all of these materials in circularity without any degradation,” Kim Holmes, the vice president of sustainability for PLASTICS, tells me. “I like to think of it as getting us to that infinite polymer state.”

To assess the viability of the technology, I visit an Oregon company called Agilyx, which sells itself as providing “the world’s only circular-economy solution for plastics.” As I pull into the parking lot, in an industrial zone outside Portland city limits, I encounter a middle-aged man unloading long styrofoam blocks, nearly as tall as he is, from his van into a grubby dumpster marked “Public Polystyrene Drop Off.”

Agilyx recycles that notorious eco-villain, styrofoam. The feedstocks here include coolers from transporting frozen fish, foam packaging for TVs, and styrofoam bricks used by the timber industry to grow seedlings for replanting. On the day of my visit, these weathered bricks are piled some 20 feet high inside the company’s warehouse. “We don’t need to preprocess it,” says CEO Joe Vaillancourt. “We don’t need it cleaned. We’re going right back to the molecule.”

The process begins by crushing styrofoam and breaking it into pebbles that resemble quartz. This material is mixed with shredded pieces of unfoamed polystyrene — material used to make red Solo cups. The mix travels up a conveyor belt and gets dumped into a reactor that turns the plastic into a gas, unzipping the plastic polymer to produce a styrene oil that’s cooled and pumped into black barrels for shipment back to a styrofoam manufacturer.

The factory handles 10 tons of material a day. But it’s not waste-free. The reactor spits out a heavy, black-carbon residue from the contaminants in the plastic, and produces a propane-like waste gas that’s flared into the atmosphere. The gasification process — known as pyrolysis — is also energy-intensive, relying on heat and high pressure. But Agilyx insists its product creates 70 percent less greenhouse pollution than starting with fossil fuels.

Vaillancourt pitches chemical recycling as environmental-harm reduction. Those who dream of a plastic-free world are doing just that, dreaming: “There are 7 billion people in the world whose daily lives increasingly depend on it,” he says. “It won’t go away.” The world is using nearly 400 billion kilograms of plastics a year — and demand is growing. “You can ban single-use all you want,” he says. “It’s really not going to get rid of the amount of plastics appreciably.”

Chemical recycling is in its infancy. And many environmentalists dismiss it as a “distraction” that has yet to prove itself as anything other than an expensive niche technology — joining bioplastics and compostable alternatives that have long been hyped as offering a path to sustainability, but failed to claim any real market share. Coca-Cola recently touted a batch of soda bottles made with chemically recycled waste from the sea. But it made just 300 of the containers, underscoring questions of cost and scalability.

Villaincourt admits that “the existing waste and recycling industries have never been set up” to supply companies like his, and that many companies can make more money landfilling waste plastic. “For this to really scale very large,” he says, will require disruption — including from the government. “Some companies are just gonna wait till it’s legislated,” he says. “Because of the profit motive, there’s no reason to change.”

The industry’s voluntary actions to curb plastic pollution are driven by two clear motives: One is protecting the environment, the other is protecting profits from regulation. “None of us want to live in a world where waste is unmanaged,” says Steve Russell of the ACC. “None of us want to have either the environmental or the legislative consequences of an unmanaged system.”

In Washington, the plastics industry is asking government, and American taxpayers, to foot the bill to revitalize the moribund recycling industry. The RECOVER Act — backed by both PLASTICS and the ACC — would offer $500 million in federal-matching funds for investment in new infrastructure. This summer, PLASTICS showed off a demonstration project with high-tech, near-infrared scanning machines that can segregate plastics by their polymer type, improving on human sorters who can’t distinguish between two identical-seeming yogurt cups, each made from different plastics.

For Sen. Tom Udall, our involuntary ingestion of plastic waste is proof that the country can’t wait decades for plastic polluters to reform their own practices, or rely on half-measures to bolster the current recycling system. “We are beyond the crisis point on plastic waste,” he says, “and people are starting to wake up.” Udall wants consequences for an industry that has sloughed its environmental harms onto the rest of us for long enough.

Washington is late to the game when it comes to plastics regulation, and Udall’s strategy is to adopt best practices from across the globe. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act would mimic Europe in banning commonly polluted single-use plastics, including plastic bags, styrofoam cups and carry-out containers, and plastic utensils. Plastic straws would be allowed only by request.

The bill would expand the market for recycled plastics by creating a minimum recycled content for beverage containers, while also imposing a 10-cent deposit on each container sold — roughly nationalizing the models of Michigan and Oregon, where residents return nearly nine in 10 containers for recycling.

The bill would create “extended producer responsibility” — making the industry responsible for the waste it creates by requiring that producers “design, manage, and finance programs to collect and process waste that would normally burden state and local governments.” Udall emphasizes that today’s industry is hardly trying, often slapping an unrecyclable label on an otherwise recyclable bottle. He insists regulation will drive innovation, so that recyclability becomes a top goal of product design. “We’re trying to turn the industry around,” he says, “to do this in a more environmentally sustainable way.”

The legislation would formally ban the U.S. from exporting plastic waste to developing countries, in alignment with the Basel Convention. Perhaps most controversially, the bill would halt construction of new plastics facilities, giving the EPA time to craft new regulations. Udall insists his bill can return value to the economy, and save consumers a lot of money, noting that every year plastic worth up to $120 billion “is lost after one short use.”

The senator is not naive. He knows he’s going up against some of the deepest pockets in the corporate world. “This is not going to be easy,” he says. “Major industry players are going to oppose some of our efforts.” Indeed, PLASTICS is already blasting the single-use ban in his bill, insisting that “bans of otherwise completely recyclable materials will not solve our country’s waste-management issues.” But Udall believes the issue of remediating plastic pollution has the potential to transcend the bitter divides of our current politics. The notion that we’re all consuming a credit card a week turns the stomachs of Republicans just as much as it does Democrats. “We don’t know the human health impacts,” he says. “But we can only imagine they aren’t good.”

The bill’s lead sponsor in the House, Rep. Alan Lowenthal of California, insists his motivation isn’t punitive. He points to regulations he helped pass as a state legislator to clean up air pollution at the Port of Los Angeles, which improved public health while modernizing a port that now makes more money than ever: “We’re not interested in destroying the people who provide products to bring our goods to market,” he says. But Lowenthal insists change is coming: “We have to start this process. There’s no quick fix, but we also know that time is not on our side.”

The companies of the plastics industry, Lowenthal says, are ultimately “going to have to deal with the sticker shock that they are now responsible and they’re going to have to pay” to keep plastics out of the environment. The alternative, he insists, has become untenable: “What we have in plastic is something that has made our lives more convenient and easier. But unless we figure out how to keep this out of the waste stream, it’s just going to kill us.”"

"Plankton, responsible for 70 percent of Earth's oxygen, are fleeing the mid latitudes and headed north. ""It means that even if we manage to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, which is doubtful, ecosystems around the globe are likely to be profoundly affected.""",https://phys.org/news/2019-05-migration-north-climate-plankton.html,"Comparison between modern plankton communities and ocean floor sediment suggest plankton species have migrated north as the water temperature there became more like their original habitats

Climate change that has warmed the world's oceans has prompted a ""worrying"" northward migration among some communities of the smallest organisms in the sea: plankton.

That is the conclusion of new research published Thursday in the journal Nature examining the make-up of plankton communities across the northern hemisphere.

The unassuming creatures are sometimes referred to as the ""building blocks"" of the ocean because of their importance in the food chain, and their apparent migration is another indicator of the profound effect of climate change on the planet.

""This isn't good news for marine ecosystems,"" said Lukas Jonkers, the study's lead author and a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Bremen's Center for Marine Environmental Sciences.

""We see that we have pushed marine ecosystems, or at least this group of zooplankton, away from their natural state. I think that's very worrying,"" he told AFP.

""It means that even if we manage to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, which is doubtful, ecosystems around the globe are likely to be profoundly affected.""

The subject of the research is the organism known as planktonic foraminifera, a kind of plankton with a distinctive hard shell.

When these ubiquitous creatures die, they fall to the ocean floor like snow, and their hardy shells are able to resist the ravages of time.

That means they create an indispensable and unparalleled record of what plankton communities in different parts of the world have looked like going back centuries.

And that record solves a long-standing problem for researchers trying to examine how marine life has been affected by climate change—a clear baseline.

Jonkers decided to harness the record and compare samples collected in the modern era, between 1978 and 2013, with ocean floor sediment going back centuries.

What he found was that modern communities of plankton often bore little resemblance to the communities recorded in the sediment below.

A team studying whales and seals in the Arctic found the animals were being forced to shift their feeding habits as the ocean warms

Instead, the modern communities looked like the sediment record in waters further south, suggesting plankton species have migrated north as the water temperature there became more like their original habitats.

Clear pattern of change

""Everything moved towards the north,"" said Jonkers.

""At one location you always find many different species, but we now see that this species community is composed of different species that like warmer water better.""

For example, the modern species that were seen near Greenland are the same as those in the pre-industrial sediment found further south.

The study looked at nearly 4,000 samples from a range of zones across the northern hemisphere, so it is not yet clear how modern plankton communities in southern waters compare to their predecessors in those tropical locations.

But Jonkers said the pattern of change in the locations studied was clear.

""Where the temperature has changed more, the species has changed more.""

It was not possible to pinpoint a precise timeline for the change, but Jonkers said it appeared to be gradual.

And so far, he said, there was not evidence of species extinction, just movement of communities from one location to another.

But the migration could pose a problem for plankton and the animals that rely on them for food if the new arrivals don't adapt quickly enough to survive among the other residents of their warmer environments.

The research joins a growing body of evidence about the way climate change affects the ocean.

In March, a team studying seals and whales in the Arctic found the animals were being forced to shift their feeding habits as the ocean warms, melting ice and prompting fish stocks to move.

The Staggering Worldwide Decline of Insects Is a Warning of Ecosystem Collapse,https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a26323324/insect-population-ecosystem-collapse/,"Thirty years ago, in the book , Bill McKibben proposed the idea of nature—like a species—going extinct. “Our comforting sense of the permanence of our natural world, our confidence that it will change gradually and imperceptibly if at all, is the result of a subtly warped perspective,” McKibben wrote. “Changes that can affect us can happen in our lifetime in our world.”



One of those changes has been brought to the fore in an alarming study published in the journal Biological Conservation, which claims that more than 40 percent of the world’s insect species could go extinct in the next three decades. Scientists from the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the universities of Sydney and Queensland reviewed 73 existing reports of insect declines from around the world. They found that insect biomass is falling by 2.5 percent a year since McKibben published his seminal work, eight times faster than the rate of decline for mammals, birds, or reptiles.

The reasons for such a staggering rate of extinction will come as a surprise to no one. Loss of habitat (due to intensive agriculture, deforestation, and urbanization) takes the number one spot, with pollution from synthetic pesticides and fertilizers a close second. The new classes of insecticides introduced in the past 20 years (e.g., neonicotinoids and fipronil) have been especially damaging because they are used routinely and sterilize the soil, killing everything in it. The study also cites biological factors such as introduced species and disease-causing microorganisms. Climate change, which is naturally affected by all of the above, is also a cause.

While these practices have always been environmentally unfriendly, they have generally been pursued under the notion that nature is fundamentally and infinitely resilient. As McKibben puts it: “In the past, we spoiled and polluted parts of that nature, inflicted environmental ‘damage.’ But that was like stabbing a man with toothpicks: though it hurt, annoyed, degraded, it did not touch vital organs, block the path of lymph or blood. We never thought that we had wrecked nature. Deep down, we never really thought we could.”

But it turns out we can, and have. Lead author of the new study, Francisco Sánchez-Bayo, an honorary associate at the School of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Sydney, bluntly translates the findings in an interview with The Guardian: “In 10 years, you will have a quarter less, in 50 years only half left, and in 100 years, you will have none.”

Insects represent 70 percent of all animal species on the planet. They pollinate 75 percent of all the crops in the world, which of course become the food that fills up our grocery store shelves and our bodies and our children’s bodies. Insects comprise the base of many food chains and webs, without which countless other species can’t survive: birds, bats, fish, reptiles, and mammals of every size and description. It’s absurd to even attempt to catalog the cascading effects of catastrophic insect die-off here. Best to resort to the study’s “highlights” (an irony if there ever was one):



In addition to the 40 percent threatened with extinction, one third are currently classed as Endangered.

“Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species.” We’re not talking about a rare moth with a crazy-long proboscis that pollinates some deep-jungle orchid. We’re talking about the insects in your backyard: Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), and Coleoptera (beetles).

“Four aquatic taxa are imperiled and have already lost a large proportion of species.” That’s four separate taxonomic groups either threatened or gone.

Fast-breeding pests that are tolerant of pollutants, like flies and cockroaches, will likely fill the vacancies left behind and continue to thrive due to warmer global temperatures and the disappearance of their slow-to-breed predators. Entomologist Don Sands underscores the importance of “insects as moderators of other pest populations.” Without them, he told CNN, “we have insect populations that flare up and ruin crops.”

While the study presents a comprehensive and systematic look at the drivers behind these dramatic declines, it is based on reports primarily from North America and Europe. More research is needed in Africa, South America, and Asia to generate a truly accurate assessment of global insect populations.

Even without that data, however, Sánchez-Bayo doesn’t mince words about the implications of continued species losses: “This will have catastrophic consequences for both the planet’s ecosystems and for the survival of mankind.”

In other words, what we will experience in our lifetimes goes beyond McKibben’s idea of an end; it is the actual structural and functional collapse of the natural systems which have supported life on Earth for the last 400 million years.

The study urges the “rethinking of current agricultural practices” in favor of “sustainable, ecologically-based practices” to “safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide.” Yes, even scientists feel compelled to refer to natural systems as “services.” A 2017 study reporting Germany's decline of total flying insect biomass went so far as to calculate that such “ecosystem services provided by wild insects have been estimated at $57 billion annually in the USA.”

Frame it as a get-and-spend scenario that threatens the long-term viability of human life, and maybe, just maybe, Monsanto will listen. But probably not. Time to convert your property to an insect-friendly island.

"The Trump administration announced plans to significantly weaken the Endangered Species Act, the nation’s bedrock conservation law",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/12/donald-trump-administration-weaken-endangered-species-act/1985543001/,"Trump administration overhauls Endangered Species Act as critics fear animal extinction

Doyle Rice | USA TODAY

Show Caption Hide Caption These are the most endangered mammals on the planet Poachers forced this rhino subspecies down to two. Now scientists are in a race to save them before it’s too late.

The Trump administration announced a major overhaul Monday to the Endangered Species Act that it said would reduce regulations. Environmentalists said the changes would push more animals and plants to extinction because of threats from climate change and human activities.

The changes end blanket protections for animals newly deemed threatened and allow federal authorities for the first time to take into account the economic cost of protecting a particular species.

The Endangered Species Act protects more than 1,600 species in the USA and its territories.

“The best way to uphold the Endangered Species Act is to do everything we can to ensure it remains effective in achieving its ultimate goal – recovery of our rarest species,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt said in a statement. “The act’s effectiveness rests on clear, consistent and efficient implementation.”

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said, “The revisions finalized with this rulemaking fit squarely within the president’s mandate of easing the regulatory burden on the American public, without sacrificing our species’ protection and recovery goals.""

The act helped save the bald eagle, California condor, the grizzly bear and dozens of other animals and plants from extinction since President Richard Nixon signed it into law in 1973.

At least 10 attorneys general joined conservation groups in protesting an early draft of the changes, saying they would put more wildlife at greater risk of extinction.

“These changes crash a bulldozer through the Endangered Species Act’s lifesaving protections for America’s most vulnerable wildlife,” said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “For animals like wolverines and monarch butterflies, this could be the beginning of the end.

""We’ll fight the Trump administration in court to block this rewrite, which only serves the oil industry and other polluters who see endangered species as pesky inconveniences,” he said. “We’ll do everything in our power to get these dangerous regulations rescinded, including going to court.”

Drew Caputo of the environmental group Earthjustice said, ""This effort to gut protections for endangered and threatened species has the same two features of most Trump administration actions: It's a gift to industry, and it's illegal. We'll see the Trump administration in court.”

The Endangered Species Act has prevented more than 99% of listed species from going extinct, according to Earthjustice. It is also wildly popular: 90% of Americans support the act, the group said.

Late Monday, both California and Massachusetts said they’ll go to court to fight the Trump administration’s overhaul of the act.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official Margaret Everson said during a media call Monday that the changes “provide the maximum degree of regulatory certainty” while protecting species.

The Property and Environment Research Center praised the changes. ""Our interest is getting this landmark wildlife protection law to work better,” Executive Director Brian Yablonski said. “That means fostering conditions so landowners become more enthusiastic in their role as stewards for species recovery, not worried if they find an endangered species on their land.”

Media Just Can’t Stop Presenting Horrifying Stories as ‘Uplifting’ Perseverance Porn,https://fair.org/home/media-just-cant-stop-presenting-horrifying-stories-as-uplifting-perseverance-porn/,"“THIS IS AWESOME!” That’s how Fox 5 DC described its story (5/28/19) about Logan Moore of Cedartown, GA, a disabled two-year-old whose parents were unable to afford to buy him a walker, so employees at Home Depot fashioned one together themselves for him.

The story closely resembles another recent CNN report (4/1/19): “A Two-Year-Old Couldn’t Walk on His Own. So a High School Robotics Team Built Him a Customized Toy Car.” That piece noted how Minnesotan toddler Cillian Jackson couldn’t walk due to a genetic condition, and how his parents couldn’t afford treatment. It described the ingenuity of the school children who built him a car, and Cillian’s new found freedom, but did not explore why a baby with a disability had been abandoned by US society.

The clear implication in these stories was that those children would have been left permanently unable to move if not for the help of underpaid employees or the kindness of other children. How many disabled American children with poor parents were not so lucky? The articles did not ask. Instead, they were presented as “uplifting” human interest pieces.

Cillian’s story is part of CNN’s Good Stuff series, which asks its readers:

Want more inspiring, positive news? Sign up for The Good Stuff, a newsletter for the good in life. It will brighten your inbox every Saturday morning.

Unfortunately, these stories are part of a popular trend of unintentionally horrifying “uplifting” news, which we at FAIR have catalogued before (FAIR.org, 8/3/17; 3/25/19), where out-of-touch corporate media give us supposedly charming, wholesome and positive news that actually, upon even minimal retrospection, reveals the dire conditions of late capitalism so many Americans now live under, and makes you feel worse after reading it.

A lot of these stories involve mothers and the extremely difficult circumstances of raising children in the US while poor. CNN’s “feel good” story (8/24/18) about a teacher sitting in a car with her student’s baby so the new mom could attend a job fair raised far more questions than it asked (which was zero). Why is there so little public childcare in the US? Should a new mother really need to immediately find a job so badly? Is this good for infants’ development?

On a similar subject, Good Morning America (7/17/18) describes the “trendy” new baby-shower gift of donating your pregnant co-worker your days off to give her maternity leave. Every country in the world except the US and Papua New Guinea guarantees paid maternity leave, meaning the trend is unlikely to catch on abroad.

Many outlets (CBS, 5/20/16; Huffington Post, 8/6/16; People, 4/11/16) cheerfully reported on how one man did at least 15 years of backbreaking labor as a night shift janitor at Boston College so his children could attend for free. But none even mentioned that if he lived in nearly any country in Western Europe, this wouldn’t have been necessary, as university there is free or virtually free to attend.

In fact, rather than discussing ballooning tuition costs, Yahoo! (11/15/17) used the story to take jabs at disloyal millennials:

Millennials move from job to job in order to climb the ladder…. For baby boomers and other generations…loyalty and dedication to a single company or career drove, and still drives, much of their working lives.

Any of these stories could have been used to explore the pressing social and economic realities of being poor in the United States, and having to work for things considered fundamental rights in other countries. But instead they are presented as uplifting features, something only possible if we unquestionably accept the political and economic system.

Kids Do the Darndest Things

Many of what Think Progress (8/2/18) labels “feel-good feel-bad stories” involve children doing things they wouldn’t have to in any reasonable society. CBS invites us to enjoy an account of a boy selling his Xbox computer to help his (single) mom (4/2/19), and another repairing his town’s ravaged roads himself (4/12/19). The Hill (6/10/19), meanwhile, describes a nine-year-old saving his pocket money to pay off his school friends’ “lunch debts.”

NBC (5/22/19) likewise shared the story of homeless Tennessee teen Tupac Moseley graduating high school as a valedictorian and earning many college scholarships, something that was widely reported (BBC, 5/22/19; Newsweek, 5/21/19; Business Insider, 5/21/19). NBC matter-of-factly noted that after his father died, Moseley’s family’s home was foreclosed and they were on the streets, accepting this situation without comment. This was still among the most critical of the reports, however, as many did not even describe why a child in the richest society in history became homeless. CNN’s report (5/22/19), for example, did not explain the background circumstances, let alone comment on them, and frames the story with the sentence, “Hardships were never an excuse for Moseley.”

This sentence is telling: To corporate media, even the trauma of losing a parent and being forced onto the streets is merely an excuse, not a cause for poor grades. The implication is that poor housing, a lack of an adequate safety net, underfunded schools and a decimated public education system are simply excuses from bellyaching lazy people as to why they did not attend the private Boston University (at over $54,000 per year tuition), like the article’s author did.

“No excuses” is a common phrase in “perseverance porn” stories. For example, Today (2/20/17) used it in the headline of a story about a Texas man who is forced to walk 15 miles to work every day. It reveals the ultimate bootstrap ideology of the media, where societal factors are irrelevant and everyone is where they are on merit.

Thus Moseley’s story is effectively weaponized by CNN against anyone who would question the system. Terrible work conditions? No excuses! Homeless? Stop complaining!

In case you thought homeless children were something of an aberration in America, CNN (7/2/19) also recently ran a story about how over 100 homeless children graduated high school in New York City this year alone—again without comment on what this says about US society.

Another reprehensible story treated as heroic by media was that of a Michigan mother who had to quit her job to look after her terminally ill son, who died of leukemia. She could not afford a headstone, so his best friend, 12-year-old Kaleb Klakulak, worked many jobs to attempt to pay for one. Many media outlets (e.g., Associated Press, 12/8/18; Fox News, 12/9/18; NBC Chicago, 12/12/18) celebrated Kaleb’s spirit, but none asked why children are performing hard, outdoor labor through a Michigan winter so other children can have adequate burials. Such reporting implicitly normalizes this situation, and the system that allows it to happen.

“Sweet” Stories

A common media trope is presenting kids selling lemonade as cute, sweet stories, no matter how horrifying or depressing the reason, including to pay off school lunch debts (Yahoo! News, 5/21/19; MSN, 5/22/19), or to raise money for their baby brother’s medical treatment (New York Post, 5/28/18; CBS, 5/29/18) or their mother’s chemotherapy (KTSM El Paso, 8/4/18).

Or how about the story of a New Mexico girl selling lemonade trying to fund her mother’s kidney transplant? People magazine (5/9/18) applauded her resolve, and local radio described it as “heartwarming” that she had raised over $1,000. The massive problem is a kidney transplant in America can cost over $400,000. To anyone with a heart, what this story actually represents is the desperate struggle of a child trying in vain to save her dying mother. Worse still is the fact that if she lived in Sweden, Spain or Saskatchewan, she would be given a kidney free of charge and without question.

Any of the numerous other outlets (ABC, 4/30/18; Good Morning America, 5/1/18; Albuquerque Journal, 4/30/18) that picked it up could have used the story to discuss the dysfunctional healthcare system that is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the country, while producing some of the worst health outcomes in the developed world, or to scrutinize how corporate healthcare gouges the sickest and most vulnerable Americans, including children. Surely the most basic function of government should be to prevent its citizens from needlessly dying? Not if you wholly accept the tenets of neoliberalism, where education, housing and healthcare are not basic, inalienable human rights, but commodities to be bought and sold and bargained for on the market.

To be clear, while we can admire the never-say-die attitude of those in tough conditions, this is no substitute for guaranteed public programs to help those in dire need. The problem with perseverance porn is not the brave subjects of the articles, but the lack of any journalistic scrutiny examining the failings of society that placed them in such desperate circumstances to begin with.

What these articles highlight so clearly is not only the grim, inhuman and unnecessary conditions so many Americans are forced to live under, but the degree to which mainstream corporate journalists have completely internalized them as unremarkable, inevitable facts of life, rather than the consequences of decades of neoliberal policies that have robbed Americans of dignity and basic human rights. Because corporate media wholly accept and promote neoliberal, free-market doctrine, they are unable to see how what they see as “awesome” is actually a manifestation of late-capitalist dystopia."

Lynn Eden is Senior Research Scholar (Emeritus) at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. Her scholarly work focuses on the military and society; science, technology, and organizations; and US nuclear weapons history and policy. Eden’s Whole World on Fire: Organizations, Knowledge, and Nuclear Weapons Devastation won the American Sociological Association’s 2004 Robert K. Merton award for best book in science and technology studies. Her current research and writing (mostly historical) asks how a specific US military planning organization has enabled good people to plan what, if put into action, could or would result in the deaths of tens or hundreds of millions of people. In other words, how do US military officers make plans to fight and prevail in nuclear war? Eden argues that the answer is three-fold: 1) because nuclear war has not occurred, the horrific human, societal, and ecological consequences of use are not fully vivid to most planners, most of the time; 2) deadline-driven, depersonalized, and quantitative organizational routines focus war planners on abstract operations and entities; and, 3) U.S. intention is not to destroy cities and to kill vast numbers of people per se. This provides some moral comfort, even though many “civilian objects” would be destroyed in the course of striking leadership and command and control structures in and near cities.

Plummeting insect numbers threaten collapse of nature,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature?,"The world’s insects are hurtling down the path to extinction, threatening a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, according to the first global scientific review.

More than 40% of insect species are declining and a third are endangered, the analysis found. The rate of extinction is eight times faster than that of mammals, birds and reptiles. The total mass of insects is falling by a precipitous 2.5% a year, according to the best data available, suggesting they could vanish within a century.

The planet is at the start of a sixth mass extinction in its history, with huge losses already reported in larger animals that are easier to study. But insects are by far the most varied and abundant animals, outweighing humanity by 17 times. They are “essential” for the proper functioning of all ecosystems, the researchers say, as food for other creatures, pollinators and recyclers of nutrients.

Insect population collapses have recently been reported in Germany and Puerto Rico, but the review strongly indicates the crisis is global. The researchers set out their conclusions in unusually forceful terms for a peer-reviewed scientific paper: “The [insect] trends confirm that the sixth major extinction event is profoundly impacting [on] life forms on our planet.

“Unless we change our ways of producing food, insects as a whole will go down the path of extinction in a few decades,” they write. “The repercussions this will have for the planet’s ecosystems are catastrophic to say the least.”

The analysis, published in the journal Biological Conservation, says intensive agriculture is the main driver of the declines, particularly the heavy use of pesticides. Urbanisation and climate change are also significant factors.

“If insect species losses cannot be halted, this will have catastrophic consequences for both the planet’s ecosystems and for the survival of mankind,” said Francisco Sánchez-Bayo, at the University of Sydney, Australia, who wrote the review with Kris Wyckhuys at the China Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.

The 2.5% rate of annual loss over the last 25-30 years is “shocking”, Sánchez-Bayo told the Guardian: “It is very rapid. In 10 years you will have a quarter less, in 50 years only half left and in 100 years you will have none.”

One of the biggest impacts of insect loss is on the many birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish that eat insects. “If this food source is taken away, all these animals starve to death,” he said. Such cascading effects have already been seen in Puerto Rico, where a recent study revealed a 98% fall in ground insects over 35 years.

The new analysis selected the 73 best studies done to date to assess the insect decline. Butterflies and moths are among the worst hit. For example, the number of widespread butterfly species fell by 58% on farmed land in England between 2000 and 2009. The UK has suffered the biggest recorded insect falls overall, though that is probably a result of being more intensely studied than most places.

Bees have also been seriously affected, with only half of the bumblebee species found in Oklahoma in the US in 1949 being present in 2013. The number of honeybee colonies in the US was 6 million in 1947, but 3.5 million have been lost since.

There are more than 350,000 species of beetle and many are thought to have declined, especially dung beetles. But there are also big gaps in knowledge, with very little known about many flies, ants, aphids, shield bugs and crickets. Experts say there is no reason to think they are faring any better than the studied species.

A small number of adaptable species are increasing in number, but not nearly enough to outweigh the big losses. “There are always some species that take advantage of vacuum left by the extinction of other species,” said Sanchez-Bayo. In the US, the common eastern bumblebee is increasing due to its tolerance of pesticides.

Most of the studies analysed were done in western Europe and the US, with a few ranging from Australia to China and Brazil to South Africa, but very few exist elsewhere.

“The main cause of the decline is agricultural intensification,” Sánchez-Bayo said. “That means the elimination of all trees and shrubs that normally surround the fields, so there are plain, bare fields that are treated with synthetic fertilisers and pesticides.” He said the demise of insects appears to have started at the dawn of the 20th century, accelerated during the 1950s and 1960s and reached “alarming proportions” over the last two decades.

He thinks new classes of insecticides introduced in the last 20 years, including neonicotinoids and fipronil, have been particularly damaging as they are used routinely and persist in the environment: “They sterilise the soil, killing all the grubs.” This has effects even in nature reserves nearby; the 75% insect losses recorded in Germany were in protected areas.

The world must change the way it produces food, Sánchez-Bayo said, noting that organic farms had more insects and that occasional pesticide use in the past did not cause the level of decline seen in recent decades. “Industrial-scale, intensive agriculture is the one that is killing the ecosystems,” he said.

In the tropics, where industrial agriculture is often not yet present, the rising temperatures due to climate change are thought to be a significant factor in the decline. The species there have adapted to very stable conditions and have little ability to change, as seen in Puerto Rico.

Sánchez-Bayo said the unusually strong language used in the review was not alarmist. “We wanted to really wake people up” and the reviewers and editor agreed, he said. “When you consider 80% of biomass of insects has disappeared in 25-30 years, it is a big concern.”

Other scientists agree that it is becoming clear that insect losses are now a serious global problem. “The evidence all points in the same direction,” said Prof Dave Goulson at the University of Sussex in the UK. “It should be of huge concern to all of us, for insects are at the heart of every food web, they pollinate the large majority of plant species, keep the soil healthy, recycle nutrients, control pests, and much more. Love them or loathe them, we humans cannot survive without insects.”

Matt Shardlow, at the conservation charity Buglife, said: “It is gravely sobering to see this collation of evidence that demonstrates the pitiful state of the world’s insect populations. It is increasingly obvious that the planet’s ecology is breaking and there is a need for an intense and global effort to halt and reverse these dreadful trends.” In his opinion, the review slightly overemphasises the role of pesticides and underplays global warming, though other unstudied factors such as light pollution might prove to be significant.

Prof Paul Ehrlich, at Stanford Universityin the US, has seen insects vanish first-hand, through his work on checkerspot butterflies on Stanford’s Jasper Ridge reserve. He first studied them in 1960 but they had all gone by 2000, largely due to climate change.

Ehrlich praised the review, saying: “It is extraordinary to have gone through all those studies and analysed them as well as they have.” He said the particularly large declines in aquatic insects were striking. “But they don’t mention that it is human overpopulation and overconsumption that is driving all the things [eradicating insects], including climate change,” he said.

Sánchez-Bayo said he had recently witnessed an insect crash himself. A recent family holiday involved a 400-mile (700km) drive across rural Australia, but he had not once had to clean the windscreen, he said. “Years ago you had to do this constantly.”"
"“By slashing enviro rules/regs (95 so far as of Dec 2019) Trump is stimulating/enhancing the likelihood of a veritable outbreak of chronic illnesses, well beyond current massive numbers; expect multiple chronic illnesses per person to mushroom, creating a drug-infested nation full of Mad Hatters.”",https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/02/28/forever-chemicals-tap-water/,"by

Throughout the history of Western Civilization there are times, but only on rare occasions, when people en masse feel compelled to run into the streets, similar to the storming of the Bastille 1789, screaming at the top of their lungs: “Stop the Madness!”

Now is one of those times, as only recently Feb 2020 the Trump administration signed a regulation to remove America’s water resources from federal protection. This is the largest rollback of the Clean Water Act since passage into law in 1972. No other administration over the past 50 years has removed federal control over certain key aspects of the all-important landmark legislation known as the Clean Water Act.

“This will be the biggest loss of clean water protection the country has ever seen,” according to the Southern Environmental Law Center.

“This is not just undoing the Obama rule. This is stripping away protections that were put in place in the ’70s and ’80s that Americans have relied on for their health.” (Source: EcoWatch, Jan. 23, 2020)

Trump’s disgusting and kinda creepy reversal of one of America’s longest-standing policies protecting the public from environmental muck, crud, slime, sludge, oozing glop and most significantly “manmade chemicals” affects every citizen all across the land. It goes right to the heart of the morality of the country.

Still, many Americans are already drinking chemically laced water, aka: Forever-Chemicals, straight out of the tap, yet they don’t know.

According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG) Washington, DC, for the first time: Toxic fluorinated chemicals, known as PFAS (a family of manmade Forever Chemicals – lasting forever in the environment) have been discovered in drinking water in dozens of cities, including the major metropolitan areas of America. These studies have not previously been reported to the public at large.

Accordingly, the number of Americans exposed to toxic chemicals has been drastically underestimated in prior studies by both the EPA and by EWG’s own research. This is not good news.

Making matters more challenging, recent tests exposed multiples of festering problems that include newly discovered toxic chemicals

“… that are not commonly tested for presence in drinking water.” (EWG)

In other words, testing for drinking water toxicity has been deficient for years. By all appearances, governmental rules and regulations should be greatly enhanced and expanded, not diminished or abolished, as has been the case over the past couple of years.

America’s president (Trump) comically boasts: “America is the cleanest. Our air is the cleanest. Our water is the cleanest in the world.” Trump’s misinformed, deeply disturbing blatant lying proves that he is the most dangerous uniformed ill-equipped president of all time.

Not only that, across the board, Trump has reversed decades of solid, established policies designed to safeguard U.S. citizens. Yes, he actually abolishes policies that protect the health of the very same voters who belly up, squeezing into tiny voting booths, to blindly vote for him. It’s horrific on the scale of Greek tragedies where the main character is eventually brought to ruin as a consequence of: (1) tragic character flaws, (2) moral weakness and (3) inability to cope. Trump scores on all counts.

Only recently, the self-congratulatory tragi-comic Trump pounded his chest for being the first president to successfully open up drilling to America’s most pristine wildlife refuge, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). For decades, Congress steadfastly forbade drilling on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Anybody with the slightest sensibility and moral courage would fight tooth and nail to prevent despoiling ANWR, which Trump flailed while admitting he’d never heard of ANWR, but he had no compunction whatsoever about removing restrictions for drilling and mining and/or private development, even though he’d never heard of ANWR. Presidential?

Trump’s lack of sensitivity, awareness, consciousness borders on the absurd and exposes a deep level of stupidity or maybe just plain ole ignorance that is seldom, if ever, exposed in the highest echelons of political office.

And, even worse, much-much worse, without giving a second thought, “congressional Trumpers” voted to reverse the long-standing policy of protecting America’s most pristine wilderness. Members of Congress achieved it via attachment to an “unrelated” 2017 tax bill, which is the weasel-out methodology for underhandedly killing policies that Americans are sensitive about. Hands down, ANWR is one of those.

Meanwhile, as for toxic water, EWG’s testing found 44 locations in 31 states; all but one had detectable PFAS in public drinking water with some of the highest levels found in Miami, Philadelphia, New Orleans, northern NJ, and suburbs of NYC.

Not only that, it gets worse, as 34 locations that tested positive for PFAS toxic contamination had not been previously reported to the public by the EPA or by state environmental agencies.

Coincidentally, but not at all surprising since toxic chemicals disrupt, alter, and destroy healthy human cells, the number of Americans (150,000,000) diagnosed with chronic illness in America is off the charts.

Along those same lines, it’s instructive to consider that the top three causes of death in 1900 were infectious diseases pneumonia and flu, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal infections. Chronic diseases were not prevalent. Antibiotics led to dramatic declines in those infectious diseases. Whereas today, it’s no longer an infectious disease that kills, its chronic disease like heart disease and cancer as the leading causes of death which are not caused or spread person-to-person, not infectious, and not fixed with antibiotics.

By all appearances, humanity’s modern-day surge in chronic diseases is due to alteration/destruction of bodily cell structure, which brings to mind somber troublesome questions about life environments.

According to Earthjustice, a San Francisco-based nonprofit environmental law org: “Toxic chemicals known as PFAS are found in everyday products… They’re linked to cancer, and they’ve contaminated drinking water sources across the country.” (Source: Breaking Down Toxic PFAS, Earthjustice, Feb. 12, 2020)

PFASs are chemical substances that don’t easily break down and persist in the human body, similar to ionizing radiation, where accumulation occurs over the years and leads to a series of chronic conditions in people, for example, cancer and Alzheimer’s.

Studies are just now starting to show links, connecting the dots for the first time, to chemical substances like PFAS to testicular cancer (every male’s biggest nightmare), kidney cancer, and endocrine disruption. Clearly, somebody somewhere should take responsibility for diligently cleaning up America’s water systems with more restrictive rules, not less enforcement.

Good news, bad news: The good news: PFASs have proven so toxic that manufacturers phased them out entirely by 2015, but (bad news) the contamination of water supplies is already a fait accompli, no turning back after decades of toxic exposure.

More bad news: Against the protests of 200 scientists, chemical companies have replaced older PFAS with new chemicals in the PFAS family called GenX, which, unfortunately, act a lot like the old PFAS and may be equally dangerous. (Source: Earthjustice)

The industrial release of PFAS is one major source of water contamination. For example, in 2016, researchers discovered “troubling levels of GenX in North Carolina’s Cape Fear River. The source was a PFAS manufacturing plant owned by The Chemours Company, a spin-off of DuPont.” (Earthjustice)

PFASs also accumulate in the human body via food and food packaging, as discovered in a 2017 study when PFASs were found in 1/3rd of all fast food wrappers.

As for America’s Trump-crippled-EPA, more bad news: There are no PFAS listed on the EPA’s important “Toxics Release Inventory,” which is the primary tool for alerting communities across the country to toxic problems.

Not only that, and possibly making matters much worse (other than having Trump as president) on Feb. 14th, 2019 the EPA unveiled a long-delayed Nationwide Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Action Plan. “However, the plan is too little, too late, and falls short of what is needed to protect communities from a class of chemicals that are polluting drinking water and air, while exposing families, particularly children, to a myriad of heath risks, including cancer.” (Earthjustice)

All of which highlights gross incompetence, carelessness and/or heartlessness via governmental regulatory agencies under leadership of the White House.

EPA was first alerted to the toxic drinking water problem 20 years ago but ever since has failed to set an enforceable nationwide legal limit. In 2016 (pre-Trump) the EPA issued a drinking water advisory of 70 ppt, whereas, in sharp controversial contrast, independent studies and labs say the recommended safe level for PFAS in drinking water should be 1 ppt, and certainly, absolutely not 70 ppt!

EWG has already mapped PFAS toxic contamination of drinking water or groundwater in 1.400 sites in 49 states. Older EWG studies concluded that 110 million Americans were drinking toxic water, an estimate that is probably way too low based on the more recent findings.

All of which, not alarmingly, coincides with the aforementioned Rand Corp study indicating that 150,000,000 Americans have chronic illnesses, like Alzheimer’s, arthritis, asthma, cancer, COPD, Crohn’s disease, diabetes, epilepsy, heart disease, bipolar mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease.

Henceforth, by slashing environmental rules and regulations (ninety-five [95] so far according to the New York Times, as of Dec. 21, 2019) the Trump administration is stimulating/enhancing the likelihood of a veritable outbreak of chronic illnesses, well beyond the current massive numbers; expect multiple (2-3) chronic illnesses per person to mushroom, creating a drug-infested nation full of Mad Hatters.

Postscript: The EPA’s outside scientific advisory board issued a negative draft report (Dec. 2019) stating the Trump water rule proposals were “…in conflict with established science… and the objectives of the Clean Water Act.” The majority of those members of the advisory board are handpicked Trump appointees. Will they be fired?

Post-Postscript: “This will be the biggest loss of clean water protection the country has ever seen,” Southern Environmental Law Center lawyer Blan Holman told The New York Times. “This puts drinking water for millions of Americans at risk of contamination from unregulated pollution. This is not just undoing the Obama rule. This is stripping away protections that were put in place in the ’70s and ’80s that Americans have relied on for their health.” (Source: EcoWatch, Jan. 23, 2020)"
Large freshwater animal populations are down 88% since 1970.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14753,"Freshwater ecosystems are among the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. At the same time, they are among the most threatened ecosystems but remain underrepresented in biodiversity research and conservation efforts. The rate of decline of vertebrate populations is much higher in freshwaters than in terrestrial or marine realms. Freshwater megafauna (i.e., freshwater animals that can reach a body mass ≥30 kg) are intrinsically prone to extinction due to their large body size, complex habitat requirements and slow life‐history strategies such as long life span and late maturity. However, population trends and distribution changes of freshwater megafauna, at continental or global scales, remain unclear. In the present study, we compiled population data of 126 freshwater megafauna species globally from the Living Planet Database and available literature, and distribution data of 44 species inhabiting Europe and the United States from literature and databases of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and NatureServe. We quantified changes in population abundance and distribution range of freshwater megafauna species. Globally, freshwater megafauna populations declined by 88% from 1970 to 2012, with the highest declines in the Indomalaya and Palearctic realms (−99% and −97%, respectively). Among taxonomic groups, mega‐fishes exhibited the greatest global decline (−94%). In addition, freshwater megafauna experienced major range contractions. For example, distribution ranges of 42% of all freshwater megafauna species in Europe contracted by more than 40% of historical areas. We highlight the various sources of uncertainty in tracking changes in populations and distributions of freshwater megafauna, such as the lack of monitoring data and taxonomic and spatial biases. The detected trends emphasize the critical plight of freshwater megafauna globally and highlight the broader need for concerted, targeted and timely conservation of freshwater biodiversity."
"""The end of the world is no longer a fanciful hypothesis. It is the most plausible scenario.""",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/climate-strike-protests-arctic-melting-a8825936.html,"The end of the world is no longer a fanciful hypothesis. It is the most plausible scenario. In the last week, the UN Environment assembly announced its finding that, even if the Paris Agreement targets were met, global temperatures would rise by three to five degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Worse, even if all carbon emissions stopped immediately, the Arctic would be 5 degrees warmer at the end of the century than in the period between 1986 and 2005. The Arctic, that “Ice Temple of the polar regions” as the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen dubbed it, is particularly sensitive to global heating. As the Cambridge polar researcher Peter Wadhams has shown, the “Arctic death spiral” is well underway. This ice will soon disappear, beginning with an ice-free September any year now.

The loss of ice-cover reduces albedo, wherein solar radiation is reflected back into space. More dark water surface absorbs heat rather than deflecting it. Thawing permafrost releases warming methane into the atmosphere. The warming of the oceans, coupled with their ongoing carbonic acidification due to carbon emissions, will kill off a lot of marine life. The last of the remaining coral will be bleached, thus destroying one of the most biologically productive areas of the planet. It will also kill much of the phytoplankton that produce about half of the oxygen we breathe. The simple act of breathing will most likely become far more effortful, far more of a struggle, in the future.

Every ecological crisis in the ‘web of life’ impacts on every other. Consider some other recent findings. As a research team at the MIT has found, billions would regularly suffer deadly heatwaves by 2070, and half a billion would be struck by temperatures that would kill in the shade within six hours. Last year, the UN announced that it will take just 60 harvests for the erosion of fertile top soil to make the feeding of humanity impossible.

This exacerbates what one research team calls “biological annihilation”, the terrifying loss of vertebrate populations amid the sixth mass extinction. Previous mass extinction events have taken place in pulses lasting for tens of thousands of years, separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Our current mass extinction event is faster: 60 per cent of animal populations have been wiped out since 1970. All of this, combined with dropping insect biomass, desertification and more regular flooding and weather disasters, will likely congeal with capitalism’s regular crises to produce chronic and worsening breakdowns in the means of life. In the short to medium term, that raises dark questions about the political future. In the long term, it suggests that the chances for human survival are very slim.

As Christophe Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz have shown, we knew about these issues all along. And as the writer David Wallace-Wells points out, the majority of carbon emissions in the entire history of humanity have taken place since 1992: after the first UN climate framework for climate change was agreed, and during the reign of Kyoto and Paris. Even the UN’s finding is not entirely new. Previous studies have discovered that, on average, Paris Agreement measures would lead to 3.7 degrees of warming. What is different now is that the estimate is official. Previous official estimates have tended to systematically underestimate the extent of Arctic melting, thus unfortunately reducing the pressure to do anything about it.

World powers view this disaster as a commercial and military opportunity to be deliriously pursued. Nato conducts grandstanding exercises in the region, the US and Canada invest in new fleets of ice-cutters, Denmark successfully trials its first commercial voyage in the transpolar sea route, and Russia re-opens military bases. The British government anticipates $100bn worth of investment in the new, blue Arctic, while the US looks forward to mining vital oil and gas reserves hidden under the thinning ice. This is not that different in practice from the Trump administration, which admitted that it expected a catastrophic 4 degrees of global warming by 2100, but only in order to justify ditching fuel-efficiency standards as a waste of time. Since the planet is doomed, capitalist nihilism seems to suggest, we may as well party now."
"""Ocean ecosystems likely to collapse in 2020s and land species in 2040s unless global warming stemmed.""",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/wildlife-destruction-not-a-slippery-slope-but-a-series-of-cliff-edges,"New study finds ocean ecosystems likely to collapse in 2020s and land species in 2040s unless global warming stemmed

Wildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought.

Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.

Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen.

By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest.

“It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature.

'Tipping points' could exacerbate climate crisis, scientists fear Read more

What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse.

The authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005.

Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.

“Despite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn’t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one – or a few – snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,” Pigot explained.

“In our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.”

The scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an “abrupt exposure event”, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage.

But at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures.

That means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by “flattening the curve” of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt.

“It is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,” said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study.

Oceans losing oxygen at unprecedented rate, experts warn Read more

“Our research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.”

Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting.

This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating.

Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss.

“The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”"

World leaders urged to 'step back from precipice' of ecological ruin,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/18/world-leaders-urged-to-step-back-from-precipice-of-ecological-ruin-aoe,"As governments prepare to negotiate a Paris-style UN agreement on nature, 23 former foreign ministers have issued a call for urgent action

Humanity’s ongoing destruction of nature threatens the survival of our species, a group of former foreign ministers has warned, calling on leaders to step back from “the precipice” of irreversible ecological ruin and protect the planet.

The planet’s rapidly warming oceans must be the focus of increased conservation efforts due to their importance in producing oxygen and food for billions of people, the former ministers added, as governments prepare to begin negotiations for a Paris-style UN agreement on nature next week.

In a statement signed by 23 diplomats – including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind – world leaders are urged to back the draft UN agreement to protect almost a third of the world’s oceans and land.

Q&A What is the Kunming biodiversity conference 2021? Show Hide In 2021, hundreds of biodiversity experts and government ministers are expected to negotiate new targets on biodiversity at a meeting in the Chinese city of Kunming. The aim of the accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, is to stop and reverse rampant biodiversity loss around the world. Why is it a big deal?

In 2017 scientists said humans were causing the sixth mass extinction event in the Earth’s history. Now the UN has reported that the world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Are only governments worried?

No. At the 2020 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity, ahead of infectious diseases, terror attacks and interstate conflict. What might the Kunming agreement look like?

In January, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity published a 20-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. But critics say this does not go far enough. Is this agreement part of a long term plan?

Yes. The UN has an overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The 2030 goals relate to that ambition in five ways: ensuring no net losses in the integrity and size of freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems; reducing the number of species threatened with extinction; enhancing genetic diversity; achieving the targets of the Paris agreement; and sharing the benefits of genetic resources and traditional knowledge.

Next week’s meeting in Rome – originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China but moved to the Italian capital in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak – will be the first time governments formally react to the 20-point proposals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.

UN draft plan sets 2030 target to avert Earth's sixth mass extinction Read more

The current draft commits countries to protect 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species, and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%.

“The loss and degradation of nature jeopardises human health, livelihoods, safety and prosperity. It disproportionately harms our poorest communities while undermining our ability to meet a broad range of targets set by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. We must rise above politics and ideology to unite the global community around the urgent cause of protecting our planet and way of life,” reads the statement, which was released through non-profit thinktank Aspen Institute.

The former ministers highlighted the climate crisis, the “excessive exploitation” of natural resources, and ecosystem degradation as grave threats to international security, warning they “imperil the future for our grandchildren”.

“Humanity sits on the precipice of irreversible loss of biodiversity and a climate crisis that imperils the future for our grandchildren and generations to come. The world must act boldly, and it must act now,” the statement continues.

The comments follow those by indigenous groups, scientists and business leaders ahead of the meeting in Rome.

“The marine environment deserves special attention, as it covers 70% of our planet, and even people who live far inland depend on the ocean to produce half of the oxygen we breathe, to serve as the primary source of protein for over 3 billion people, and to help maintain a liveable climate,” the statement continues.

“In addition to protecting 30% of the ocean, we also call on nations of the world to manage the entirety of their ocean territories in a manner that is sustainable, equitable, and integrated across sectors. This combination of protection and sustainable management will ensure the health and productivity of the global ocean on which we all depend.”

Last month, the UN’s new biodiversity chief warned humanity will have “given up” on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.

When asked what not taking action would mean, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, told the Guardian: “The risks will be major. One is that we will not have listened to the science and the evidence provided. Because we will not have listened, it means the global community will have said: let biodiversity loss continue, let people continue to die, let the degradation continue, deforestation continue, pollution continue, and we’ll have given up as an international community to save the planet.

“I hope that’s not where any of us would want to be.”

Greenland, home to the world's second largest ice sheet, is melting at such an alarming rate that scientists are warning it's on track with worst-case scenario models for the year 2070.

On Wednesday alone, the island lost 11 billion tons of ice, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI). That's enough water to fill 4,400,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.

Video from science journalist Laurie Garrett went viral, showing melt water gushing under a bridge in Kangerlussiauq, a small town in western Greenland at the eastern end of a deep fjord.

Greenland has been enduring the heat wave that last week baked Europe, breaking temperature records in five countries. Now, it is accelerating the annual summer melt of the ice sheet and causing massive ice loss.

""The current melt rate is equivalent to what the model projects for 2070, using the most pessimistic model,"" Xavier Fettweis, a Belgian climate researcher at the University of Liège, said.

There is ice melt every year in the Arctic with slightly warmer months. But temperatures across the ice sheet have reached above freezing, even climbing into the 70's Fahrenheit on parts of the coast, and warmer winter months mean that the ice is less likely to recover.

Since June, 240 billion tons of ice have melted, per DMI. In comparison, 290 billion tons were lost in all of 2018, and August, the last month in peak melting season, has just begun. Melting season also began a month earlier than usual this year, according to DMI.

Scientists are noticing that these kinds of heat waves are becoming ""more and more frequent,"" Marco Tedesco, a polar scientist specializing in Greenland for the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University in New York, told ABC News in June. At the time, another pocket of air led to clear skies and therefore more solar radiation, baking the eastern part of Greenland and melting 2 billion tons of the ice sheet.

While that melt was shocking, it pales in comparison to the one on Wednesday, as evident in the chart above.

Researchers believe these events are connected to the jet stream, or polar vortex, becoming less stable, which creates high-pressure systems that can be sustained for longer periods of time and leads to the ""exceptional melting,"" Tedesco said.

A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has contributed to more than a half-inch of rising ocean waters since 1972, making it the largest contributor of new water into the ocean every year.

The warming has accelerated so much in recent years that about a quarter inch of the additional water occurred in the last eight years, the study found.

(MORE: Pompeo cancels trip to Greenland after saying climate change presents economic 'opportunities')

On average, the Greenland ice sheet produces about 270 gigatons of discharge in the oceans per year, Tedesco said. Since 2003, the ice sheet has contributed about 10 millimeters over the last 15 years, and scientists expect that number to increase as the earth continues to warm, which would equate to about a 1 meter sea rise by the end of the century, said Martin Stendel, senior climate and arctic researcher with DMI.

President Donald Trump has continually cast doubt on the science behind climate change and rather than address it, has relaxed environmental regulations and withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.

During the Arctic Summit in April, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heralded the melting of the sea ice as an economic opportunity: ""Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade,"" he said during a speech on the sidelines of the summit in Finland. ""Arctic sea lanes could come before -- could [become] the 21st Century Suez and Panama Canals.""

Pompeo was scheduled to visit Greenland, but he canceled hours before to fly back to Washington for White House meetings."

Then you were there again less than a year later. Then you’re there with the new pair ripped across the knees, less than 2 months after you bought them, embarrassed but also confused. Are you imagining it, or was this different before?

I remember acutely the moment in 2010 when I put on a pair of what looked like black brogues and discovered they were nothing but a kind of vinyl sac with a rubber pad for a sole. They aren’t shoes, I realized with a chill, looking around the sleek glass box of a Manhattan store. They just look like them. And no wonder. For $20 you can’t buy shoes, not really. You’re buying a facsimile designed to get you out the door and back again in a couple of weeks, when brogues are out of style and ballet flats are in. You aren’t imagining it: clothes have changed, and what has happened is a whodunit where the stakes are very, very high.

In the 1950s, Americans spent a whopping ten percent of their income on clothes. These garments were relatively expensive, compared to what we expect now, but they also lasted longer. When people had to choose a new skirt or suit for the office, they might not be able to afford another one for quite some time. In fact, as journalist Elizabeth Cline wrote in her 2012 book Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion, for much of the twentieth century, many people often did not buy clothes more than a few times a year. Even until relatively recently—as late as the 1980s—new clothes were usually occasional purchases. Labor has always been the most expensive part of clothing, and an irreducible one at that: It is actually impossible to mechanize a seamstress, beyond giving her a sewing machine. “Because clothing is so labor-intensive, the price of labor directly affects the retail price of clothes,” says Cline, who has continued to cover the social and environmental impact of modern fashion.

However, in 1993 came a turning point. With the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it became much, much easier to import clothing. Over the next ten or so years, a quota system that had limited the number of imported items entering the US was abolished. Very swiftly, US-based textile mills and factories went out of business. Around the world, similar events happened in developed countries with free-trade agreements. Labor, that limiting factor, was at least ten or 20 times cheaper in other places. Companies that didn’t move their operations out of the US could not compete. Not long afterward, one of the most successful business models of this century took advantage of this change to shoulder its way to the front of the pack: it is now called “fast fashion.”

Fast-fashion companies such as Zara and H&M make their money by shortening the time between trends and encouraging customers to buy inexpensive clothes that, in many cases, appear to be made to last no longer than the lifetime of the fad. Currently, H&M alone makes between 550 and 600 million items of clothing a year. And thanks to the fact that most clothes today are made by people working for low wages, developed-world consumers have never spent so little on their wardrobes. It might surprise you to learn that Americans now buy at least one item of clothing a week.

Run this clock forward over the years, however, and you start to see a problem (beyond the humanitarian one—companies continue to use factories like the one in which more than 1,000 workers died in a building collapse in Bangladesh in 2013). Already, says Cline, “global clothing consumption has doubled in the past 15 years.” The industry, driven by fast fashion, has steadily become one of the most serious polluters in the world. Clothing manufacture was never exactly tidy, what with toxic dyes, copious amounts of water needed for growing fiber and processing fabrics, and waste from factories. But in 2015, carbon emissions from clothes surpassed those emitted from all international flights and all maritime shipping combined. Cotton, for example, uses more pesticides than any other crop—and organic cotton takes up more land and much more water than conventionally grown cotton. At the same time, clothes are worn for less time than they ever have been previously. Every year, 12.7 million tons of textiles enter American landfills; in 2015 in the UK, 300,000 tons of clothes went in, about ten pounds per person. Giving old clothes to charity isn’t the charitable act you might think it is—many of the clothes made today are of such poor quality that they cannot be sold again.

You might not think of yourself as the kind of person who cares much about clothes. I know I didn’t. As someone who has always felt like a brain inconveniently hampered by a body, I can’t say I ever thought much about them—except to wonder why, as an averagely shaped human being, I found it so hard to find things that fit. But even if you don’t spend much time thinking about fashion, this concerns you."
"American millennials' mental and physical health is on the decline — and they're on track to die faster than Gen X, a new report says",https://www.businessinsider.com.au/millennials-gen-x-mortality-rate-mental-health-depression-2019-11?r=US&IR=T,"Radu Bighian/EyeEm/Getty Images Millennials’ physical and mental health is suffering, a report said.

American millennials aren’t exactly the picture of health.

They’re seeing their physical and mental health decline at a faster rate than Gen X did as they age, a new Blue Cross Blue Shield report found.

The report used a baseline projection representing historical outcomes of “health shocks” and an adverse projection of current trends. It’s possible this decline could be rectified with proper management and treatment, but without intervention, millennials could see a 40% increase in mortality compared with Gen Xers of the same age, the adverse projection showed.

In this scenario, millennials could end up shelling out a third more in treatment costs than Gen Xers of the same age, because of a greater need for treatment and rising healthcare costs.

Healthcare is one of four key costs plaguing millennials. In 1960, the average annual cost of healthcare per person was $US146 – in 2016, it hit $US10,345. When adjusted for inflation, that’s a ninefold increase. Costs are expected to further increase to $US14,944 in 2023.

Poorer health could also make millennials less likely to participate in the US labour market, resulting in higher unemployment and a loss of annual income by more than $US4,500 per person, the Blue Cross report said.

The report attributed this millennial health decline to both physical conditions, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, and behavioural health – particularly rises in rates of depression, hyperactivity (such as anxiety or ADHD), and substance abuse.

Rises in depression and ‘deaths of despair’

The report found that rates of depression and hyperactivity among American millennials increased by about 30% from 2014 to 2017.

These findings are underscored by previous reports that analysed data from Blue Cross Blue Shield’s Health Index. One found that major-depression diagnoses were rising at a faster rate for millennials and teens than they were for any other age group.

There has also been a rise in accidental deaths, which overall make up a larger share of mortality among millennials than they did for Gen Xers at the same age, the latest Blue Cross report found. It’s worth noting that accidental deaths from heroin and other opioid overdoses specifically have increased by 1,400% among all generations from 2010 to 2017.

A report by the public-health groups Trust for America’s Health and Well Being Trust yielded similar findings earlier this year. It found that more millennials were dying “deaths of despair,” or deaths related to drugs, alcohol, and suicide, Jamie Ducharme reported for Time in June.

While these deaths have increased across all age groups in the past 10 years, they have increased the most among younger Americans, accounting for the deaths of about 36,000 American millennials in 2017 alone, the report said. Drug overdoses were the most common cause of death.

Millennials struggle to afford the help they need

There are several reasons for the upticks in “deaths of despair,” according to the Trust for America’s Health and Well Being Trust report. Young adults are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behaviours, represent the highest percentage of enrolled military personnel, and disproportionately live in “high-stress environments” like correctional facilities.

But there are other structural factors at play, the report said – namely the myriad financial problems millennials are facing, like student-loan debt, healthcare, childcare, and an expensive housing market.

This affordability crisis has become so bad that some millennials can’t afford treatment. One in five millennials diagnosed with major depression doesn’t seek treatment, a Blue Cross report published earlier this year found, and it’s likely because they can’t afford to do so.

It’s a vicious cycle: Money struggles aren’t only hurting millennials’ health, but preventing them from seeking help for those very issues.

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or has had thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life, get help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) provides 24/7 free, confidential support for people in distress, as well as the best practices for professionals and resources to aid in prevention and crisis situations.

"Climate change: ‘We’ve created a civilisation hell bent on destroying itself – I’m terrified’, writes Earth scientist",http://theconversation.com/climate-change-weve-created-a-civilisation-hell-bent-on-destroying-itself-im-terrified-writes-earth-scientist-113055,"The coffee tasted bad. Acrid and with a sweet, sickly smell. The sort of coffee that results from overfilling the filter machine and then leaving the brew to stew on the hot plate for several hours. The sort of coffee I would drink continually during the day to keep whatever gears left in my head turning.

Odours are powerfully connected to memories. And so it’s the smell of that bad coffee which has become entwined with the memory of my sudden realisation that we are facing utter ruin.

It was the spring of 2011, and I had managed to corner a very senior member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) during a coffee break at a workshop. The IPCC was established in 1988 as a response to increasing concern that the observed changes in the Earth’s climate are being largely caused by humans.

The IPCC reviews the vast amounts of science being generated around climate change and produces assessment reports every four years. Given the impact the IPPC’s findings can have on policy and industry, great care is made to carefully present and communicate its scientific findings. So I wasn’t expecting much when I straight out asked him how much warming he thought we were going to achieve before we manage to make the required cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

“Oh, I think we’re heading towards 3°C at least,” he said.

“Ah, yes, but heading towards,” I countered: “We won’t get to 3°C, will we?” (Because whatever you think of the 2°C threshold that separates “safe” from “dangerous” climate change, 3°C is well beyond what much of the world could bear.)

“Not so,” he replied.

That wasn’t his hedge, but his best assessment of where, after all the political, economic, and social wrangling we will end up.

“But what about the many millions of people directly threatened,” I went on. “Those living in low-lying nations, the farmers affected by abrupt changes in weather, kids exposed to new diseases?”

He gave a sigh, paused for a few seconds, and a sad, resigned smile crept over his face. He then simply said: “They will die.”

That episode marked a clear boundary between two stages of my academic career. At the time, I was a new lecturer in the area of complex systems and Earth system science. Previously, I had worked as a research scientist on an international astrobiology project based in Germany.

In many ways, that had been my dream job. As a young boy, I had lain on the grass on clear summer evenings and looked up at one of the dots in the night sky and wondered if around that star a planet orbited with beings that could look up from the surface of their world and similarly wonder about the chances of life being found within the unremarkable solar system we call home in the universe. Years later, my research involves thinking about how surface life can affect the atmosphere, oceans and even rocks of the planet it lives on.

That’s certainly the case with life on Earth. At a global scale, the air we all breathe contains oxygen largely as a result of photosynthetic life, while an important part of the UK’s national identity for some – the white cliffs of Dover – are comprised of countless numbers of tiny marine organisms that lived more than 70m years ago.

So it wasn’t a very large step from thinking about how life has radically altered the Earth over billions of years to my new research that considers how a particular species has wrought major changes within the most recent few centuries. Whatever other attributes Homo sapiens may have – and much is made of our opposable thumbs, upright walking and big brains – our capacity to impact the environment far and wide is perhaps unprecedented in all of life’s history. If nothing else, we humans can make an almighty mess.

Change within a lifetime

I was born in the early 1970s. This means in my lifetime the number of people on Earth has doubled, while the size of wild animal populations has been reduced by 60%. Humanity has swung a wrecking ball through the biosphere. We have chopped down over half of the world’s rainforests and by the middle of this century there may not be much more than a quarter left. This has been accompanied by a massive loss in biodiversity, such that the biosphere may be entering one of the great mass extinction events in the history of life on Earth.

What makes this even more disturbing, is that these impacts are as yet largely unaffected by climate change. Climate change is the ghosts of impacts future. It has the potential to ratchet up whatever humans have done to even higher levels. Credible assessments conclude that one in six species are threatened with extinction if climate change continues.

The scientific community has been sounding the alarm over climate change for decades. The political and economic response has been at best sluggish. We know that in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to rapidly reduce emissions now.

Robbie Andrew

The sudden increase in media coverage of climate change as a result of the actions of Extinction Rebellion and school strike for climate pioneer Greta Thunburg, demonstrates that wider society is waking up to the need for urgent action. Why has it taken the occupation of Parliament Square in London or children across the world walking out of school to get this message heard?

There is another way of looking at how we have been responding to climate change and other environmental challenges. It’s both exhilarating and terrifying. Exhilarating because it offers a new perspective that could cut through inaction. Terrifying as it could, if we are not careful, lead to resignation and paralysis.

Because one explanation for our collective failure on climate change is that such collective action is perhaps impossible. It’s not that we don’t want to change, but that we can’t. We are locked into a planetary-scale system that while built by humans, is largely beyond our control. This system is called the technosphere.

The technosphere

Coined by US geoscientist Peter Haff in 2014, the technosphere is the system that consists of individual humans, human societies – and stuff. In terms of stuff, humans have produced an extraordinary 30 trillion metric tons of things. From skyscrapers to CDs, fountains to fondue sets. A good deal of this is infrastructure, such as roads and railways, which links humanity together.

Along with the physical transport of humans and the goods they consume is the transfer of information between humans and their machines. First through the spoken word, then parchment and paper-based documents, then radio waves converted to sound and pictures, and subsequently digital information sent via the internet. These networks facilitate human communities. From roving bands of hunter-gatherers and small farming tribes, right up to the inhabitants of a megacity that teams with over 10m inhabitants, Homo sapiens is a fundamentally social species.

Just as important, but much less tangible, is society and culture. The realm of ideas and beliefs, of habits and norms. Humans do a great many different things because in important ways they see the world in different ways. These differences are often held to be the root cause of our inability to take effective global action. There is no global government, for a start.

But as different as we all are, the vast majority of humanity is now behaving in fundamentally similar ways. Yes, there are still some nomads who roam tropical rainforests, still some roving sea gypsies. But more than half of the global population now lives in urban environments and nearly all are in some way connected to industrialised activities. Most of humanity is tightly enmeshed into a globalised, industrialised complex system – that of the technosphere.

Importantly, the size, scale and power of the technosphere has dramatically grown since World War II. This tremendous increase in the number of humans, their energy and material consumption, food production and environmental impact has been dubbed the Great Acceleration.

The tyranny of growth

It seems sensible to assume that the reason products and services are made is so that they can be bought and sold and so the makers can turn a profit. So the drive for innovation – for faster, smaller phones, for example – is driven by being able to make more money by selling more phones. In line with this, the environmental writer George Monbiot argued that the root cause of climate change and other environmental calamities is capitalism and consequently any attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately fail if we allow capitalism to continue.

But zooming out from the toil of individual manufacturers, and even humanity, allows us to take a fundamentally different perspective, one that transcends critiques of capitalism and other forms of government.

Humans consume. In the first instance, we must eat and drink in order to maintain our metabolism, to stay alive. Beyond that, we need shelter and protection from physical elements.

There are also the things we need to perform our different jobs and activities and to travel to and from our jobs and activities. And beyond that is more discretional consumption: TVs, games consoles, jewellery, fashion.

The purpose of humans in this context is to consume products and services. The more we consume, the more materials will be extracted from the Earth, and the more energy resources consumed, the more factories and infrastructure built. And ultimately, the more the technosphere will grow.

The emergence and development of capitalism obviously lead to the growth of the technosphere: the application of markets and legal systems allows increased consumption and so growth. But other political systems may serve the same purpose, with varying degrees of success. Recall the industrial output and environmental pollution of the former Soviet Union. In the modern world, all that matters is growth.

The idea that growth is ultimately behind our unsustainable civilisation is not a new concept. Thomas Malthus famously argued there were limits to human population growth, while the Club of Rome’s 1972 book, Limits to Growth, presented simulation results that pointed to a collapse in global civilisation.

Today, alternative narratives to the growth agenda are, perhaps, getting political traction with an All Party Parliamentary Group convening meetings and activities that seriously consider de-growth policies. And curbing growth within environmental limits is central to the idea of a Green New Deal, which is now being discussed seriously in the US, UK, and other nations.

If growth is the problem, then we just have to work at that, right? This won’t be easy, as growth is baked into every aspect of politics and economics. But we can at least imagine what a de-growth economy would look like.

My fear, however, is that we will not be able to slow down the growth of the technosphere even if we tried – because we are not actually in control.

Limits to freedom

It may seem nonsense that humans are unable to make important changes to the system they have built. But just how free are we? Rather than being masters of our own destiny, we may be very constrained in how we can act.

Like individual blood cells coursing through capillaries, humans are part of a global-scale system that provides for all their needs and so has led them to rely on it entirely.

If you jump in your car to get to a particular destination, you can’t travel in a straight line “as the crow flies”. You will use roads that in some instances are older than your car, you, or even your nation. A significant fraction of human effort and endeavour is devoted to maintaining this fabric of the technosphere: fixing roads, railways, and buildings, for example.

In that respect, any change must be incremental because it must use what current and previous generations have built. The channelling of people via road networks seems a trivial way to demonstrate that what happened far in the past can constrain the present, but humanity’s path to decarbonisation isn’t going to be direct. It has to start from here and at least in the beginning use existing routes of development.

This isn’t meant to excuse policymakers for their failure of ambition, or lack of bravery. But it indicates that there may be deeper reasons why carbon emissions are not decreasing even when there appears to be increasingly good news about alternatives to fossil fuels.

Think about it: at the global scale, we have witnessed a phenomenal rate of deployment of solar, wind, and other sources of renewable energy generation. But global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. This is because renewables promote growth – they simply represent another method of extracting energy, rather than replacing an existing one.

The relationship between the size of the global economy and carbon emissions is so robust that US physicist Tim Garrett has proposed a very simple formula that links the two with startling accuracy. Using this method, an atmospheric scientist can predict the size of the global economy for the past 60 years with tremendous precision.

But correlation does not necessarily mean causation. That there has been a tight link between economic growth and carbon emissions does not mean that has to continue indefinitely. The tantalisingly simple explanation for this link is that the technosphere can be viewed like an engine: one that works to make cars, roads, clothes, and stuff – even people – using available energy.

The technosphere still has access to abundant supplies of high energy density fossil fuels. And so the absolute decoupling of global carbon emissions from economic growth will not happen until they either run out or the technosphere eventually transitions to alternative energy generation. That may be well beyond the danger zone for humans.

A repugnant conclusion

We have just come to appreciate that our impacts on the Earth system are so large that we have possibly ushered in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. The Earth’s rocks will bear witness to humans’ impacts long after we disappear. The technosphere can be seen as the engine of the Anthropocene. But that does not mean we are driving it. We may have created this system, but it is not built for our communal benefit. This runs completely counter to how we view our relationship with the Earth system.

Take the planetary boundaries concept, which has generated much interest scientifically, economically, and politically. This idea frames human development as impacting on nine planetary boundaries, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and ocean acidification. If we push past these boundaries, then the Earth system will change in ways that will make human civilisation very difficult, if not impossible, to maintain. The value of, say, the biosphere here is that it provides goods and services to us. This represents what we can literally get from the system.

Steffen, W., et al, 2015. Planetary boundaries: Guiding human development on a changing planet. Science, 347(6223), p.1

This very human-centric approach should lead to more sustainable development. It should constrain growth. But the technological world system we have built is clever at getting around such constraints. It uses the ingenuity of humans to build new technologies – such as geoengineering – to reduce surface temperatures. That would not halt ocean acidification and so would lead to the potential collapse of ocean ecosystems. No matter. The climate constraint would have been avoided and the technosphere could then get to work overcoming any side effects of biodiversity loss. Fish stocks collapse? Shift to farmed fish or intensively grown algae.

As defined so far, there appears nothing to stop the technosphere liquidating most of the Earth’s biosphere to satisfy its growth. Just as long as goods and services are consumed, the technosphere can continue to grow.

And so those who fear the collapse of civilisation or those who have enduring faith in human innovation being able to solve all sustainability challenges may both be wrong.

After all, a much smaller and much richer population of the order of hundreds of millions could consume more than the current population of 7.6 billion or the projected population of nine billion by the middle of this century. While there would be widespread disruption, the technosphere may be able to weather climate change beyond 3°C. It does not care, cannot care, that billions of people would have died.

And at some point in the future, the technosphere could even function without humans. We worry about robots taking over human’s jobs. Perhaps we should be more concerned with them taking over our role as apex consumers.

Escape plan

The situation, then, may all seem rather hopeless. Whether or not my argument is an accurate representation of our civilisation, there is the risk it produces a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because if we believe we can’t slow down the growth of the technosphere, then why bother?

This goes beyond the question of “what difference could I make?” to “what difference can anyone make?” While flying less, cutting down on eating meat and dairy and cycling to work are all commendable steps to take, they do not constitute living outside the technosphere.

It’s not just that we give tacit consent to the technosphere by using its roads, computers, or intensively farmed food. It’s that by being a productive member of society, by earning and spending, above all by consuming, we further the technosphere’s growth.

Read more: Climate change: yes, your individual action does make a difference

Perhaps the way out from fatalism and disaster is an acceptance that humans may not actually be in control of our planet. This would be the vital first step that could lead to a broader outlook that encompasses more than humans.

For example, the mainstream economic attitude about trees, frogs, mountains, and lakes is that these things only have value if they provide something to us. This mindset sets them up as nothing more than resources to exploit and sinks for waste.

What if we thought of them as components or even our companions in the complex Earth system? Questions about sustainable development then become questions about how growth in the technosphere can be accommodated with their concerns, interests, and welfare as well as ours.

This may produce questions that seem absurd. What are the concerns or interests of a mountain? Of a flea? But if we continue to frame the situation in terms of “us against them”, of human well-being trumping everything else in the Earth system, then we may be effectively hacking away the best form of protection against a dangerously rampant technosphere.

And so the most effective guard against climate breakdown may not be technological solutions, but a more fundamental reimagining of what constitutes a good life on this particular planet. We may be critically constrained in our abilities to change and rework the technosphere, but we should be free to envisage alternative futures. So far our response to the challenge of climate change exposes a fundamental failure of our collective imagination.

To understand you are in a prison, you must first be able to see the bars. That this prison was created by humans over many generations doesn’t change the conclusion that we are currently tightly bound up within a system that could, if we do not act, lead to the impoverishment, and even death of billions of people.

Eight years ago, I woke up to the real possibility that humanity is facing disaster. I can still smell that bad coffee, I can still recall the memory of scrabbling to make sense of the words I was hearing. Embracing the reality of the technosphere doesn’t mean giving up, of meekly returning to our cells. It means grabbing a vital new piece of the map and planning our escape.

Alaska’s ice cellars melting due to climate change after being used to store food for generations,https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-permafrost-alaska-ice-cellars-melting-inupiat-food-storage-whaling-a9216571.html,"After generations of storing their food in handmade cellars dug deep into the permafrost, growing numbers in Alaska’s far-north now find their cellars filling up with water and blood.

Dozens of the naturally refrigerated food shelters exist underneath the region’s mainly Inupiat whaling villages – where many rely on hunting and fishing to eat.

But now climate change and other modern factors are forcing changes to an ancient way of life, rendering traditional storage methods dangerously unreliable.

Ranging from small arctic root cellars to spacious, wood-lined underground chambers, ice cellars are typically stocked with vast amounts of whale, walrus, seal and caribou.

These chambers, usually built 10 to 12 feet below the surface, have long been used to age subsistence food to perfection and ensure a steady supply during the sparser months, which is critical for survival.

But increasingly, these cellars are beginning to collect mould and water, in some cases becoming completely submerged. Others collapse completely.

In Alaska’s northernmost community, Utqiagvik – which saw its warmest summer on record this year – about 60 per cent of the 1,500 households rely on subsistence foods for at least half of their diet, National Geographic wrote in 2015.

“I’m worried,” said Gordon Brower, a Utqiagvik whaling captain whose family owns two ice cellars.

One is more than a century old and used to store at least two tonnes whale meat set aside for community feasts. The other, built in 1955, is used to feed Mr Brower and his family.

He recently asked his son to retrieve some whale meat from the one of the cellars, and discovered both were in a bad state.

“He came back and said: ‘Dad, there’s a pool of blood and water at the bottom,’” said Mr Brower, who is now housing the community’s meat under a tarpaulin sheet above ground.

“It seems like slight temporary variations in the permafrost – that active layer – is affecting the temperature of our cellar,” Mr Brower said.

There were once at least 50 ice cellars in Point Hope, a native village built precariously on a thin spit of land caught between the Chukchi and Arctic oceans.

Now, there are less than 20 cellars in the village of 750 people.

Many in the community have little money and cannot afford to replace traditional methods with modern freezers.

To compensate, Point Hope whaling captains have use of three walk-in freezers that were donated for use by the whaling community.

But the much colder freezers do not impart the taste of aged whale meat so favoured throughout the region.

“It’s definitely a challenge at this time to be able to feed our people that acquired taste,” said 52-year-old whaling captain Russell Lane, who has spent his whole life in Point Hope.

The problem has been building for decades as a warming climate impacts multiple facets of life in the far-north – thawing permafrost, disruptions in hunting patterns and shorter periods of coastal ice that had long protected coastal communities from powerful storms. Other factors include development and soil conditions.

The changes have increased vulnerability to foodborne illnesses and raised concerns about food security, according to studies by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.

State health officials said so far they have not heard of anyone becoming ill.

Despite the unprecedented rate of modern climate change, ice cellars have failed as far back as the early 1900s, according to a 2017 study in Utqiagvik in response to reports of flooded and collapsed cellars.

Researchers mapped 71 ice cellar locations around town and monitored five functioning cellars from 2005 to 2015, finding little thermal change over that relatively short timeframe. One of those cellars has since failed, however, and another is starting to collapse.

The study concluded that while a changing climate has great potential to affect ice cellars, there are other factors, including soil conditions and urban development.

“Climate change, air temperatures, all these physical changes are affecting them,” said Kelsey Nyland from George Washington University, one of the study’s authors.

“But also, a lot of it has to do with development and modern life in an arctic setting.”

Scientists had previously agreed that an underground tunnel, known as the utilidor, built in Utqiagvik in 1984 to provide water, electricity, and other utilities had been responsible for the failure of some cellars, National Geographic reported in 2015.

To adapt to the new environment, the village of Kaktovik, on the Beaufort Sea coast, took ambitious steps after it lost all but one family’s cellar to flooding.

In 2013, the village launched a project to build a community ice cellar incorporating traditional designs with contemporary technology used in Alaska’s North Slope oil fields – thermosyphons, off-grid tubelike refrigeration devices that cool the ground by transferring heat outside.

The hand-excavated cellar was ready for use in 2017, but it has yet to be filled. Whaling captains want to expand it first, according to whaling captain George Kaleak Sr, who represents Kaktovik on the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.

Temperature sensors inside the cellar show it’s working as intended, Kaleak said. He expects the expansion to begin as early as next spring.

But experts warn melting ice cellars are a problem for hunters across the Arctic.

While some communities are able to avert crisis using modern technology, in Siberia the disappearance of millennia-old permafrost is now creating climate refugees.

With researchers continually revising their predictions for how quickly permafrost could melt, and how this could contribute to the warming of the planet, it seems increasingly likely those forced to leave their homes will not be the last.

“The permafrost is thawing so fast,” Anna Liljedahl, associate professor at the University of Alaska told The Washington Post in October “We scientists can’t keep up anymore.”"
Suicide rate up 33% in less than 20 years,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/surviving-suicide/2018/11/28/suicide-prevention-suicidal-thoughts-research-funding/971336002/,"More than 47,000 Americans killed themselves in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday, contributing to an overall decline in U.S. life expectancy. Since 1999, the suicide rate has climbed 33 percent.

Americans are more than twice as likely to die by their own hands, of their own will, than by someone else's. But while homicides spark vigils and protests, entering into headlines, presidential speeches and police budgets, suicides don't. Still shrouded in stigma, many suicides go unacknowledged save for the celebrities – Robin Williams, Kate Spade, Anthony Bourdain – punctuating the unrelenting rise in suicide deaths with a brief public outcry.

And research suggests our ways of living may be partly to blame, in ways that don't bode well for the future.

Alcohol and substance abuse are risk factors, and both are increasing. Isolation raises the risk, and nearly half of Americans say they sometimes or always feel alone. Increasing smartphone use has been linked to suicidal thoughts in teens. Even climate change has been found to have roughly the same effect on increasing suicides as an economic recession.

""We’re trying to reduce suicide death rates in the face of a culture that’s ever more fascinated with violence, that has a bunch of opiates around left and right, where family structure isn’t getting more cohesive and neither is community structure,"" said Thomas Joiner, a leading suicide researcher. ""That’s a lot to fight against.""

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. and is often called a public health emergency.

But money to research and combat suicide continues to lag behind other leading killers and even non-fatal conditions. The National Institutes of Health, the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, spent $68 million on suicide last year. It spent nearly five times that studying sleep and 10 times more on breast cancer, which killed fewer people in 2016.

""What I’m just painfully aware of is that all of the areas where the top 10 causes of death in the United States have gone down have received significantly more attention,"" said John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. ""There’s been so much more put into every one of those causes of death than suicide. ... If you didn’t do anything for heart disease and you didn’t do anything for cancer, then you'd see those rates rise, too.""

NIH officials say they do not expressly budget by disease, and research funding in other categories could affect suicide without being suicide-specific. The NIH spent $2.7 billion on mental health, for example.

""A large portion of the research is not disease-oriented but based on human biology. For instance, if we’re studying brain function, it might be pertinent to suicide, but we might not necessarily categorize it as suicide,"" said Michael Lauer, NIH deputy director for extramural research. ""Same with depression, which obviously is linked to suicide.""

Still, many in the field wish for dedicated spending. Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, advocates for $150 million a year for suicide research, still far less than the $592 million the NIH allocated to fight kidney disease, the nation's No. 9 killer.

""We are happy that other health conditions are getting the money. ... It’s not an either/or,"" Harkavy-Friedman said. But ""the cost of suicide is enormous, and people don’t realize it.""

The cost — in dollars, in suffering, in science

Suicides and suicide attempts cost $93.5 billion a year, most of it in lost productivity, a 2016 study estimated. And that's nothing compared with the cost in human lives and suffering.

Thomas Joiner, the Robert O. Lawton distinguished professor of psychology who lost his own father to suicide in 1990, teaches a class at Florida State University. Ray Stanyard, Florida State University

Joiner recognized the human toll 30 years ago – even before his own father died by suicide.

As a graduate student in psychology in 1990, Joiner had begun focusing on depression. That summer, his father, a former Marine sergeant turned software pioneer, took his own life.

“He was a successful, visionary, ambitious, intelligent man,"" Joiner said. ""And he had an illness that ended up being fatal. That’s how I see him.”

Joiner, now a psychology professor and clinician at Florida State University, said his father's death helped persuade him to make studying suicide his life's work.

“I’d already inclined toward that decision, and this only made it more stark. I already knew this was a problem,"" he said. ""It was a misery for the bereaved, and that’s not to mention the even more acute suffering suicidal people go through in the hours, days, months before their death – just a lot of suffering all around. And it wasn’t being studied then.”

It's studied now, but given the size of the problem, we still know surprisingly little about it.

""I think that we’ve told the public that we know more about suicide than we know,"" said April Foreman, a clinician on the American Association of Suicidology board of directors.

When someone dies by suicide, people and the media trot out a series of ""maybes,"" she said: Maybe it was mental illness. Maybe it was losing a job or getting divorced.

""Maybe it was not getting a phone call at just the right moment. Maybe. But maybe something was happening in their brains that in 20 years we’ll understand,"" she said. ""We tell stories about bullying or sadness like it’s a fairy tale. There’s probably real science in there, and we just haven’t decided to treat it like that. ... We’re telling stories about why people kill themselves that aren’t scientifically based, that are very inaccurate, and are just the easier stories to tell because it’s much harder to say we don’t know.""

Joiner compares suicide research today to ""cancer research about 100 years ago.""

""People were so scared of the topic they wouldn’t even say the word,"" but cancer research has since made great strides, he said. ""I think the same thing will happen with suicide research, but that’s decades in the future. Right now we’re in our infancy.""

There’s probably real science in there, and we just haven’t decided to treat it like that. ...

Suicide studies reflect the broad sweep of the current science. Some focus on genetic factors involved in maintaining brain circuits and neurotransmitters, biomarkers of at-risk populations, brain PET imaging and medications; others focus on psychotherapies, preventing substance abuse and school nurse interventions.

The effectiveness of prevention efforts has been difficult to determine as suicide rates increase, said Andrew Sperling, director of legislative affairs for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

""The challenge is there are various suicide prevention programs, and we’re still learning a lot about what works and doesn’t work,"" Sperling said. ""There’s not a lot of evidence we’ve been very effective at it.""

Scientific knowledge is limited. Public knowledge is wrong.

Even key discoveries that enjoy broad support among researchers have yet to percolate into the public consciousness.

Public health experts say: Suicide is preventable.

People think: Suicide is inevitable.

Consciously or unconsciously, many Americans write off those who seriously consider killing themselves as hopeless causes, unreachable. A study in 2017 showed that people are skeptical of a suicidal person's ability to recover – the idea that even if we stop the person today, we won't tomorrow.

""If you think once someone’s suicidal that they’re just going to die, then it doesn’t make sense to invest money in that,"" Joiner said of a common point of ""ignorance.""

Science tells us that isn't true. So does common sense. Survivors of suicide attempts themselves are walking proof.

In 2016, nearly 45,000 died by suicide, but the number who attempted was almost 29 times that — meaning more than one and a quarter-million survived. Though a previous suicide attempt makes the risk of dying by suicide higher, it is just one of many risk factors. Nine out of 10 people who survive a suicide attempt will not go on to die by suicide later, according to studies that have tracked survivors over decades.

Cliff Bauman, a National Guardsman who struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder, attempted suicide once, but when he faced a crisis again he was able to get through it by using learned coping skills, including being aware of his triggers and having people he can trust.

“I made the conscious decision (after my attempt) to go back into counseling,” he said. “(I) was opening up about why I did what I did and how it got to that point, and I felt suddenly ... the darkness doesn’t seem so dark.”

Another misconception is that suicidal ideation is rare. But one in 33 American adults seriously thought about suicide in 2016, the commonness of the thoughts belied by how rarely they're discussed.

""Suicide is reflective of other issues that we don’t want to talk about,"" said Adam Swanson, a senior prevention specialist at the Suicide Prevention Resource Center. ""We don’t want to talk about the fact that people can’t afford to pay electric bills. ... We don’t want to talk about the ... pain people carry.""

Suicide survivors share stories of hope If you could go back in time and talk to yourself in your darkest moment, what would you say? USA TODAY

Survivors are often the first to distinguish that it's not a desire to die that drove their attempt but a desire to escape pain. It's something Shelby Rowe, a PTSD and suicide attempt survivor who works in suicide prevention, knows firsthand.

""If I could go back to talk to myself that night, when all I could hear in my head was 'You can't live like this anymore, you can't live like this anymore' ... I would have said: 'It's OK, you're right. It is really awful right now, and you can't live like this anymore, but please live, because there is another way. There is another beautiful life waiting for you.'""

Mental and emotional pain is less acknowledged – both by doctors and the public – than physical pain, Foreman noted.

""It is OK for someone to suffer from wanting to kill themselves and to suffer from trying to kill themselves or even die that way, but it’s not OK to feel sick with the flu for a few days,"" she said.

Stymied by stigma

The lack of compassion people feel for those who die by suicide is reflected in the lack of funding. Stigma goes beyond misconceptions.

""Stigma is about fear, and suicide is associated with our most primal fears – fear of death ... fears of traumatic loss and our fears of mental illness,"" Draper said.

Fear and discomfort also can be expressed as anger.

Retired California Highway Patrol officer Kevin Briggs said he has heard drivers shout ""Go ahead and jump!"" to people contemplating suicide on the Golden Gate Bridge.

John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Stigma is about fear, and suicide is associated with our most primal fears – fear of death ... fears of traumatic loss and our fears of mental illness Quote icon

The taunts reflect a disdain some people feel toward those who attempt suicide, whom they see as ""weak"" or ""crazy,"" a 2017 study found. Though mental illness is a risk factor for suicide, not everyone who is mentally ill has suicidal thoughts, and not everyone who attempts suicide is mentally ill.

But even statistics on the relationship between mental illness and suicide are incomplete ""because we’re not funding it,"" Harkavy-Friedman said.

""Every year we go to (Capitol) Hill and we advocate at the state level for fully funding the National Violent Death Reporting System,"" she said.

The tracking system, now in place in just 40 states, helps health experts and law enforcement officials identify common circumstances associated with specific types of death, including suicide. Suicide can be especially hard to track without a strong system in place because family members may try to cover it up or pressure officials not to enter ""suicide"" into records. The CDC announced in September that it had received funding to expand the system to all 50 states and Washington, D.C.

In the past, even in clear cases of suicide, families were ""not telling anybody for years because they thought they would be blamed or stigmatized,"" Harkavy-Friedman said.

Stigma is not only an obstacle to accurate reporting, but it also has made politicians shy away. It's part of why suicide wasn't seriously studied or even discussed until the past few decades.

“Twenty years ago when I worked on (Capitol) Hill, you wouldn’t find suicide prevention on federal documents. It wasn’t talked about in the Department of Defense or in the general public. There were no researchers. There was no national strategy for suicide prevention,"" said Jerry Reed, a doctor on the executive committee for the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention.

That changed in 1998, when Congress declared suicide a national problem, Reed said.

""Since then, the country has caught up to the significance of this issue, but it still has a long way to go.”

Congressional support is key because it affects the overall NIH budget. Congress also can pass special provisions regarding certain issues, as it has for Alzheimer's and opioid abuse.

""Congress has made that a clear priority,"" Lauer said.

Where's the hope? A little bit in a lot of places

Despite challenges, experts agree our understanding of suicide is light-years ahead of where it was just a generation ago. And suicide prevention is at ""unprecedented"" levels, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports.

Therapy

Through interventions, including medication and therapy, Joiner says he sees suicidal patients at his clinic go from ""pretty desperate, pretty intent to die"" to ""turn(ing) a corner – and usually it’s shockingly quick.""

Joiner theorizes that suicide results from a combination of factors: feeling like a burden, isolation, and having lethal means and a lack of normal fear of death.

Short-circuit one of those – isolation, for instance – and you might stop someone from hurting himself.

""It stands to reason if you reconnect a little bit then risk should abate, so we just arrange within the context of people’s day-to-day lives small increased doses of social connection,"" Joiner said. ""It's a very simple behavioral idea, but it seems to work if people do it.""

Asking a friend to lunch would be a great example, Joiner said, but some patients don't have a friend. They might start simply with ""show up to this community event and stay for 10 minutes.""

Of course, some people are chronically suicidal, but Joiner and others note that they can also feel relief through targeted therapy.

Shear Avory, a transgender person who sees a therapist (not associated with Joiner), has lived with daily suicidal ideation and continues to hold on to hope.

""For so long I've been stuck in just wanting everything to disappear, from wanting the trauma to go away,"" said Avory, whose traumatic childhood included foster homes and conversion therapy. ""I'm still alive. I'm still here. That feels like an accomplishment. ... Healing is not a linear experience.""

Low-cost changes to health care

With unlimited funding, Joiner said he'd put resources toward practical things proven to work, such as ""means safety"" – which can include everything from putting pedestrian barriers on bridges to locking up guns and medicine cabinets – and training doctors to identify at-risk patients.

Training primary care doctors and other medical staff is the foundation of the Zero Suicide program.

Zero Suicide founder Mike Hogan said that though suicide is incredibly complex, determining who is at risk can actually be very simple: Once patients are in a health care setting, ask them. Studies have shown that asking people if they're thinking about suicide does not plant the idea in their heads.

""If people are asked, they often really want to get it off their chest, and they want some help, and it opens the door to help,"" Hogan said. ""A little bit does a lot: asking, safety planning, reducing lethal means and reaching out ... turns out to be quite powerful.""

A 2014 study found that 83% of those who die by suicide saw a health care provider in the year before their death. That's particularly true for older white men, who account for most suicides.

""We can’t predict when they’ll die, just like we can’t predict when someone might die of a heart attack,"" Hogan said. ""But we can predict who needs a little help just like someone might need help because their lipid levels are high.""

Hogan said two nonprofit organizations that offer mental health treatments – Centerstone, which spans multiple states, and the Institute for Family Health in upstate New York – saw roughly 60 percent reductions in suicides after adopting Zero Suicide.

Becky Stoll, vice president for crisis and disaster management at Centerstone, said one of the biggest improvements has been the methodical approach to plugging holes in care. For instance, coordination between the suicide prevention committee and their IT department resulted in a program that changed the font color of high-risk patients if they missed appointments, which would then alert them to start calling the patient. If the patient didn't answer, they'd start calling their friends and family. It was a simple change and it saved lives. In one case, a man's wife called him after she had received calls from Centerstone. He had been standing on a bridge at the time.

""I've been in the field since the late '80s, and I’ve not seen the enthusiasm the results that we’re seeing now,"" Stoll said. ""We don’t win every time, but we win a lot. When we know better, we have to do better. And embedding these frameworks into systems of care … it really does seem like we can have impact. It seems like that’s catching wildfire across the U.S. ... (We need to) make people feel they have lives worth living.""

Colorado has embraced Zero Suicide as one tool in its fight. But advocates are more closely watching the newly formed Colorado-National Collaborative, a partnership aimed at reducing suicides there by 20 percent by 2024.

Through a combination of funding from state and federal sources and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Colorado's Office of Suicide Prevention went from an annual budget of $536,000 about 18 months ago to $2.6 million as of Sept. 30. If the partnership between scientists and public health professionals proves effective in the state with the eighth-worst suicide rate in the country, it could be adopted nationwide.

Removing the means

Colorado and other states also have joined the Gun Shop Project, in which gun store owners and firing range instructors distribute suicide prevention materials as part of an effort to reach people who might be looking for a tool to commit suicide.

Guns were used in 23,000 of the 45,000 suicide deaths in 2016.

These interventions focus on the ""means,"" or how suicides are completed.

""We may not understand suicidality very well ... (but) we know people don’t die of feeling suicidal – they die from a gunshot wound, they die from a medication overdose. Just like you don’t die by (a driver) having poor depth perception, you die from them striking the car and your head hitting the windshield,"" Foreman said.

'On the cusp'?

Many in the suicide research and prevention field describe it as being on a precipice – the science is not where it needs to be, but it shows promise; the funding is not where it needs to be, but it has increased. On the other side, they hope, are the results: a nation in which fewer lives are lost to suicide or tormented by suicidal thoughts.

""With suicide I hope that we’re on a cusp of a movement,"" Foreman said. ""Where the people who have survived suicide attempts, the people who live with chronic suicidality, the families, the loved ones, the people who are left, that they get up and say: This suffering is the same as someone who has died by HIV ... or cancer. It deserves the same quality science.""

"By just 2050, 22% of cities will have climate conditions that don't compare to current-day conditions in any world cities. For about half of those cities, the conditions will be completely ""novel"" on earth -- conditions that don't even exist anywhere in the present day.",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/07/major-us-cities-will-face-unprecedente-climates-2050/,"Climate forecast for 2050: New York City winters will have the weather of today’s Virginia Beach, damp and cold London will be hot and dry like Barcelona, wet Seattle will be like drier San Francisco, and Washington D.C. will be more like today’s Nashville but with even greater variation in temperatures and precipitation. Those predictions are according to the first global analysis of how some cities’ climate conditions will shift under climate change.

“We wanted to know what’s the most conservative estimate of what the climate will be for 520 major cities in 2050,” said Tom Crowther, a researcher at ETH Zürich, and senior author of the study published today in the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE.

“The changes we found are huge,” Crowther says in an interview.

Climate 101: Causes and Effects The climate is certainly changing. But what is causing this change? And how does the rising temperature affect the environment, and our lives?

To illustrate their findings the Crowther Lab in Switzerland created a global data map that pairs one city’s future climate conditions with current ones. For example Minneapolis in 2050 will be more like Kansas City, with Minneapolis’s warmest month shooting up from around 80 degrees Fahrenheit on average to more than 90F in 2050.

Generally speaking, cities in the Northern Hemisphere will have the climates cities more than 620 miles to their south have today, he said.

In Europe, summers and winters will get considerably warmer by 2050, with average increases of 3.5°C and 4.7°C, respectively, compared with 2000.

There are no good pairings or analogues for more than 22 percent of the world’s major cities—those with one million or more people currently, researchers found. Those 115 cities, including Washington and 16 other U.S. cities, will have unprecedented climate conditions by 2050 compared to what they saw in 2000, the baseline for the study.

That doesn’t mean that Washington will be hotter than Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, today. It means that there is no current match for the wide climate variations in temperatures, seasonality, and precipitation the city will experience, said Crowther.

The vast majority of the 115 cities that will experience “novel” climates are in the tropics and include metropolises like Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Rangoon, and Singapore. Changes in tropical cities will be less in terms of temperature increases, but will be dominated by more frequent extreme precipitation events and the severity and intensity of droughts.

“The fate of major tropical cities remains uncertain as many will experience unprecedented climate conditions,” the study concludes.

The study uses state-of-the-art climate model projections of existing data, but analyzed in ways that will be more meaningful to the public and city planners. Knowing that London’s climate will be like Barcelona’s—which has experienced severe droughts requiring $25 million to import drinking water in 2008—can help planners prepare for what’s coming.

“We want to help people visualize the impact of climate change in their own city, within their lifetime,” says lead author Jean-Francois Bastin, a researcher at ETH Zürich.

The shift of warmer temperatures northward of 12 miles a year seems reasonable, as do the findings, said Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University. Still, the conclusions are “sobering” Mann said in an email. Also sobering is the likelihood that more than two-thirds of the world’s population will be living in urban areas by 2050.

The carbon emission trajectory used in the study is the very conservative 1.5 to 2.0 degrees Celsius stabilization projected by 2050. Actual carbon emissions are much higher and more on a 3 to 4 degree Celsius trajectory. However, the temperature increases on both trajectories are very similar up until 2050, when the current high-emission forecast diverges substantially, said Mann."
Climate change is causing people to give up on life,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5w374/climate-despair-is-making-people-give-up-on-life,"""Climate despair"" has been a phrase used at least as far back as Eric Pooley's 2010 book, The Climate War: True Believers, Power Brokers, and the Fight to Save the Earth, but it's been in wide circulation for perhaps as little as two years. In more progressive Sweden, the term klimatångest has been popular since at least 2011 (the year a Wikipedia article with that name was created ). In The Uninhabitable Earth, Wallace-Wells notes that the philosopher Wendy Lynne Lee calls this phenomenon ""eco-nihilism,"" the Canadian politician and activist Stuart Parker prefers ""climate nihilism,"" and others have tried out terms like ""human futilitarianism.""

Her case is extreme, but many people are suffering from what could be called ""climate despair,"" a sense that climate change is an unstoppable force that will render humanity extinct and renders life in the meantime futile. As David Wallace-Wells noted in his 2019 bestseller The Uninhabitable Earth, ""For most who perceive an already unfolding climate crisis and intuit a more complete metamorphosis of the world to come, the vision is a bleak one, often pieced together from perennial eschatological imagery inherited from existing apocalyptic texts like the Book of Revelation, the inescapable sourcebook for Western anxiety about the end of the world.""

""I think my anxiety just reached a peak,"" Ruttan Walker continued. It felt like there was nowhere to go, and although she had spoken to her primary care doctor about anxiety, she hadn't sought help with her mental health. Suddenly, she was contemplating self-harm. ""Though I don't think I would have hurt myself, I didn't know how to live with the fear of… the apocalypse, I guess? My son was home with me and I had to call my friend over to watch him because I couldn't even look at him without breaking down,"" Ruttan Walker said. She eventually checked herself into an overnight mental health facility.

In the summer of 2015— the warmest year on record at the time —it was the literal heat that got to Meg Ruttan Walker, a 37-year-old former teacher in Kitchener, Ontario. ""Summers have been stressful to me since having my son,"" said Ruttan Walker, who is now an environmental activist. ""It's hard to enjoy a season that's a constant reminder that the world is getting warmer.""

But climate despair goes far beyond a reasonable concern that a warming planet will make life more difficult and force humanity to make hard choices. Instead of rallying us, climate despair asks us to give up. In a 2009 study in the UK by researchers Saffron O'Neill and Sophie Nicholson-Cole, climate-related data visualizations were presented to test subjects who were urged, in fear-based terms, to take action or else. Most of the time these appeals produced ""denial, apathy, avoidance, and negative associations."" Ultimately, the researchers concluded, ""climate change images can evoke powerful feelings of issue salience but these do not necessarily make participants feel able to do anything about it; in fact, it may do the reverse."" In other words, if you tell people something must be done or we're all gonna die, they tend to take door number two, however irrational that impulse may seem.

This despair could be a consequence of climate change being on more people's minds than ever before. According to social scientist and psychology scholar Renee Lertzman, author of 2015's Environmental Melancholia, large numbers of people have recently come to the realization that climate change is real, scary, and not being addressed. ""It's a surreal experience because we're still in the same system, so walking around, people are driving, and everyone's eating a lot of meat [and] everyone's acting like that's normal,"" she said. For some people, that feeling is incompatible with carrying on with the business of everyday life.

Whatever you call it, this is undeniably a real condition, if not one with a set of formal diagnostic criteria. (It may reach that status—it took decades for ""burnout"" to be declared an official ""occupational phenomenon"" by the World Health Organization .) It's impossible to know how many people like Ruttan Walker have experienced climate despair as a mental health crisis, but despair is all around us: in our own momentary but intense reactions to the latest bit of climate news, in pitch-black memes and jokes about human extinction , even in works of philosophy and literature. There is now a fringe group of scientists and writers who not only take our imminent doom as an article of faith, but seem to welcome it.

Specifically, the letter noted that children are aware that the grown-ups are leaving them a shitty world, and that's a really messed-up thing to be aware of when you're a kid. ""A continued ecological crisis without an active solution focus from the adult world and decision makers poses a great risk that an increasing number of young people are affected by anxiety and depression,"" reads the letter, in Swedish.

From a distance, climate despair may seem like ordinary anxiety and depression in patients who happen to be fixating on climate, but it's hard to deny the unique effect climate change is having on mental health . On May 5, a group of psychologists and psychotherapists in Sweden published an open letter to their government that noted the perverse status quo of climate change—the concern wasn't so much that the environment is breaking down, but that nothing was being done about it.

""This is painful,"" Lertzman said. ""It's super painful to be a human being right now at this point in history."" Nonetheless, she added, ""We need to translate our concern—our despair, our anger our feelings—into action.""

Experts say now is precisely the wrong time to greet doom with open arms. According to Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, certainty about human extinction is not accurate, nor is it ""a particularly helpful point of view."" Dessler explained to me in an email that ""we are still (mostly) in control of our fate.""

Simply reading facts about climate change can produce reactions not too dissimilar to Thunberg's. The Uninhabitable Earth calls climate change ""the end of normal,"" explaining, ""We have already exited the state of environmental conditions that allowed the human animal to evolve in the first place, in an unsure and unplanned bet on just what that animal can endure."" Last year's UN report on humanity's probable failure to stop warming short of the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold had a similar message, as did the one from May about how 1 million species are on track to go extinct due to human-caused environmental degradation, assuming we don't change our course and stop generating greenhouse gases (alongside other forms of environmental havoc). Also in May, an Australian think tank called climate change ""a near- to mid-term existential threat to human civilization.""

Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who led the recent worldwide school strikes , said in her 2018 TED Talk that knowing about climate change was hell on her young psyche. ""When I was 11 I became ill. I fell into depression. I stopped talking and I stopped eating. In two months, I lost about 10 kilos of weight."" She would later be told she had Aspergers, OCD, and was selectively mute. Then she came out of her despair, and found a voice when she decided to strike—refusing to go to school until the world demonstrated that it's getting its shit together.

""I became very suicidal, and a large part of my justification for feeling like I'd be better off dead was that humans are hurting the Earth so much, and I as one person [couldn't] make enough of a positive impact so it would be better if I were not around to cause any more damage,"" Rohrer said.

These warning signs undoubtedly help spread awareness, but for some that awareness can breed hopelessness. Maisy Rohrer, a 22-year-old developmental researcher at New York University, has been struggling to cope with climate change for years. ""I guess the despair started when I was 18, and I began learning about how much the earth was changing, and I'd have full-blown panic attacks about the arctic sea ice melting, and the polar bears starving, and I'd call my mom telling her life was pointless,"" she said. She believed at the time that the human race ""should be wiped out.""

These feelings can be powerful, but they aren't grounded in hard science. Michael Mann, the Penn State climatologist often credited for helping bring the public's attention to the historical trends that are central to our understanding of climate change, calls this perspective ""doomism,"" and he wanted to make it clear the evidence doesn't support it. ""Unfortunately there's some bad science behind much of the 'doomism,'"" he said. ""There is no need to exaggerate or misstate what the science has to say.""

But when she says ""hope,"" she doesn't mean hope for the planet. She told me in no uncertain terms that she does not place any value whatsoever in humanity's attempts to mitigate climate change: ""I think it's too late.""

There are various ""levels,"" as she calls them, on which she struggles with the coming ecological horrors: ""Feeling as if I've already lost. Feeling out of control. Feeling like I can't start a family, so I talk myself out of wanting one or to even get married. Just giving up. Then still trying to maintain a will to keep moving forward. Trying to hold on to some form of hope.""

Even those who don't have thoughts of suicide can be affected in profound ways by climate despair. Brooke Morrison is a 26-year-old radio host in North Carolina who chatters about pop music enthusiastically when she's on air. Off-air, her world isn't so bright. ""I feel like I'm already grieving my life and my future,"" she said. Even her life plans—she wants to move to Los Angeles—are colored by her pessimism. ""I 100 percent believe that the West Coast will be underwater soon, and I'd like to experience it while there's still time left,"" she said.

This is a worldview that has blossomed on places like the /r/collapse subreddit, which curates news events in such a way as to demonstrate that the world is coming to an end. Authors Paul Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine put the term ""solutions"" in scare quotes in their 2014 Dark Mountain Manifesto , which, while mostly a literary call to arms, is also an embrace of society's ""unraveling."" And there are scientists who have marketed themselves as doomsaying prophets, only for their prophecies to be disproved. Among them are the notorious melting sea ice exaggerator Peter Wadhams and the ecologist and the-end-is-nigh-fabulist Guy McPherson .

Humanity clearly needs to treat climate as an urgent problem, and as Wallace-Wells notes in Uninhabitable Earth, it's important to discuss extremely pessimistic possibilities as long as they are in fact possible, because ""when we dismiss the worst-case possibilities, it distorts our sense of likelier outcomes, which we then regard as extreme scenarios we needn't plan so conscientiously for."" But the intellectual thrust of climate despair takes this further, insisting that only the worst-case scenarios are worth serious consideration.

Dessler puts it this way: ""I think it's clear that emissions will come down to zero and stabilize the climate sometime this century. But taking 50 years to do that will yield a different world than if we do it in 20 years. It's up to us to decide which of these worlds we want to live in.""

Here's what the science has to say: Models that use the status quo —a.k.a. ""not changing anything"" as a baseline—show that we're headed off a cliff in terms of planetary habitability. But these models are probably overstating humanity's inaction. Entire ( small ) countries have no-bullshit plans to decarbonize quickly, and larger ones are making no-bullshit progress, just not nearly fast enough. Following these trends, it's possible to imagine humanity will achieve relative climate stability, even as the already-baked-in effects of our greenhouse gas emissions—some of them horrible—keep rolling out, perhaps for thousands of years. That would be better than never decarbonizing, and never achieving any semblance of stability ever again.

But Deep Adaptation has been pilloried as an all-around shoddy piece of work by academic standards. I showed Deep Adaptation to the anthropologist Joseph Tainter , the foremost scholar I could find on the topic of societal collapse, and he told me this: ""I find Bendell's paper to be simplistic and superficial. Since it is also alarmist, I will also call it irresponsible. After reviewing environmental trends related to climate change, he fails to demonstrate how these lead to 'starvation, destruction, migration, disease and war.' Climate change might lead to some or all of these things, but in such a paper one needs to demonstrate how."" (In response to Tainter, Bendell told me his paper didn't explain the mechanism of collapse because it ""was already long, given the summary of climate science and of processes of denial,"" and said the paper ""was speaking to my professional field of sustainability management and not to other fields, such as those who study the history of societal collapses."")

But nothing compares to the intense viral bleakness of Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy, by Cumbria University professor Jem Bendell, a 2018 paper that Bendell self-published after an academic journal declined to publish it. The paper argues that total societal collapse is on its way, and describes life in the midst of that collapse with vivid sentences like, ""You will fear being violently killed before starving to death."" The paper was so powerful that people have credited it for sending them to therapy or quitting their jobs to live closer to nature .

If despair breeds inaction, that's obviously a problem. But others think a certain amount of dread could be helpful. In an essay by four sociologists (Kasia Paprocki, Daniel Aldana Cohen, Rebecca Elliott and Liz Koslov) published in May, the authors argue for something called ""useful discomfort."" They write that they couldn't help but notice that their colleagues in the physical sciences are having a tough time dealing with ""overwhelming evidence of an apocalypse,"" and that they're ""largely despairing both because of what they know, and how they are being ignored, dismissed, and even outright threatened."" However, they write, ""We believe that our discomforts are productive. They allow us to reject catastrophism and clarify possibilities for better futures.""

Taking it a step further, British writer and climate activist George Monbiot sees succumbing to despair as a moral failure. ""By throwing up our hands about the calamities that could one day afflict us, we disguise and distance them, converting concrete choices into indecipherable dread,"" Monbiot wrote in April . ""We might relieve ourselves of moral agency by claiming that it's already too late to act, but in doing so we condemn others to destitution or death.""

Anyone who follows climate change knows how devastating the consequences will be. But there's concern among academics and activists that perspectives like Bendell's do more harm than good. Mann, the climatologist, thinks even Wallace-Wells goes too far. In a response to the 2017 New York magazine article Wallace-Wells's book was based on, Mann wrote , ""Fear does not motivate, and appealing to it is often counter-productive as it tends to distance people from the problem, leading them to disengage, doubt and even dismiss it.""

In fact, as despair has ramped up, Americans' view of climate change seems to have shifted. In February, Yale published a survey of attitudes about climate change and noted an 8 percent spike in Americans ""alarmed"" by climate change over the course of a single year. That survey was conducted just after the autumn release of the UN's blockbuster 2018 special report (by which time Wallace-Wells's New York story had also circulated). The Yale survey doesn't connect those dots, and correlation doesn't mean causation, but it's tempting to think something shook a whole lot of people out of their complacency—at least momentarily. Politicians are also increasingly talking about climate change, with the left lining up behind the Green New Deal framework and even some Republicans willing to consider climate policies .

Katerina Georgiou, a London therapist, told me in an email that climate despair is ""usually connected to clients who present already with [a] diagnosis of anxiety (generalised, health, or OCD)."" Georgiou explained that these patients are suffering ""a lot,"" but in her assessment, ""it's less to do with the topic itself and more to do with the pattern of how anxiety works. Climate change just happens to be where the fixation is, but it's the fixation that is the symptom.""

""I felt like every meal I ate and every coffee or drink I had with a straw was going to be more detrimental than was probably true, and that led me to stop eating enough and to make some other decisions that hurt my overall health,"" said Rohrer. ""And this in turn fed into my depression more because of lack of nutrition and sleep, and that increased my paranoia and panic about the climate. It was just a really vicious cycle.""

That's likely not much comfort for those already struggling with mental health issues that the dialogue around climate change can worsen.

When I asked what coping strategies she suggests, Georgiou's answer was simple: ""Reduce amount of time watching the news and being on social media.""

But many of the people I spoke to who suffer from climate despair didn't want their fixation on the future of the planet to be treated as a symptom. For these patients, one important first step seems to be simply finding a therapist who acknowledges upfront that climate change isn't a manifestation of mental illness.

Rohrer was relieved to eventually find someone like this. ""She heard me out, let me rant for over two hours on our first intake appointment, and then basically said we needed to put things like my specific despair about the climate on the back burner and wrangle in my tendency to catastrophize everything… At first I was really annoyed,"" Roher told me. ""But once she explained why, and we made a plan which included coming back to it I felt understood, which helped.""

According to Ruttan Walker, the activist who had the crisis in 2015, the perfect therapist would recognize that yes, mental illness is the problem at hand, but would simultaneously recognize the ""enormity of the climate crisis."" She told me this would also need to be ""someone I could work with long term, because I still have to live in the world and the climate crisis isn't going away. Getting stuck in despair isn't an option for me as a parent or activist.""

Lertzman thinks therapists have to change, because ""what we're talking about is in fact new and unprecedented, and that we need new practices for addressing this,"" although she added, ""that doesn't mean we're starting from scratch."" She said one way or another, we need to have a whole lot of no-holds-barred conversations about how we feel about climate change, where no emotion is wrong.

""When there's a crisis going on in our lives—like a job loss, or losing someone, or a divorce, or upheaval, or now increasingly displacement from natural disasters and flooding and fire—we need to be able to process our experience, usually by talking with people,"" Lertzmen said. ""Then we can be more capable of actually moving forward. This context is no different.""

For therapists, Lertzman suggested a practice called motivational interviewing (M.I.), pioneered by the psychologists William Miller and Stephen Rollnick. Motivational interviewing is meant to steer people toward difficult but necessary behavioral changes by asking them questions. ""It takes time to have a 10-minute conversation or a 15-minute conversation using M.I. versus a five-minute interaction where you just tell someone, 'Here, you need to eat this,' or, 'You need to exercise more,'"" Lertzmen said. She added that ""respecting our experience as valuable and full of wisdom,"" is the most important part of an M.I.-derived therapy for climate despair, and that specific techniques gleaned from M.I. include ""sitting in circles talking, creating safe spaces to be honest and vulnerable, [and] sharing our stories.""

Even if therapies like these could unfailingly turn people's despair into helpful action, it seems like a slow process to undergo at a time when, as Bill Nye recently pointed out, the world is on fire. Still, Lertzman told me, sometimes we have to slow things down in order to move forward. ""There's a phrase in M.I.: 'We don't have time not to take the time,'"" she said.

But if learning to motivate people sounds time-consuming, there's another, much older and simpler way to process despair. Give into it for a moment. Cry it out. Let yourself acknowledge how fucking bad it all is, and how a lot of it is never, ever getting better. In short: grieve.

Ruttan Walker told me she often uses grief as a way to process her emotions about climate. ""We have to acknowledge that we've changed our planet. We've made it more dangerous and we've done harm,"" she said.

Lertzman co-signed this approach. ""It's healthy to grieve,"" she said. ""We need to actually pause. We need to honor and engage with how we are feeling. That's not the same as wallowing. It's not the same as going into a hole hold you never come out of."""
“World ending in 12 years was not a gaffe.” Ocasio-Cortez.,https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/ocasio-cortez-claim-world-ending-12-years-due-climate-change-not-gaffe,"Rep. Alexandira Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)

On Tuesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) declared that she did not make a “gaffe” Monday when she said the world will end in 12 years if climate change isn’t stopped. As evidence, she cited a story and study that do not say the world will end in 12 years.

Monday, in an interview, Ocasio-Cortez said:

“And I think the part of it that is generational is that millennials and people, in Gen Z, and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we’re like, the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change. “And, You’re biggest issue, your biggest issue is how are going to pay for it? — and like this is the war, this is our World War II. And I think for younger people, we’re looking at this and we’re like, how are we saying let’s take it easy when 3,000 Americans died last year, how are we saying, let’s take it easy when the Nth person died from our cruel and unjust criminal justice system?""

Tuesday, in response to a video tweet of her comment, Ocasio-Cortez expressed bewilderment that people would think she didn’t mean it, linking to an article in The Guardian citing a U.N. study:

""For some reason GOP seems to think this is a gaffe, but it’s actually a generational difference. Young people understand that climate change is an existential threat: 3,000 Americans died in Hurricane María. The UN says we’ve got 12 years left to fix it: https://amp.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report …""

But, while The Guardian article says weather events will be more severe and nature will suffer if global temperatures rise 2C degrees, instead of 1.5C degrees, it does not say the world will end:"
Honey production has collapsed to almost nothing in Italy because of climate change,https://www.repubblica.it/ambiente/2019/05/18/news/allarme_della_coldiretti_la_raccolta_del_miele_e_praticamente_azzerata-226563711/,"- Da Nord a Sud del Paese è praticamente azzerata quest'anno la produzione di miele a causa dell'andamento climatico siccitoso del mese di marzo seguito da un mese di aprile e maggio dal meteo particolarmente capriccioso caratterizzato da vento, pioggia e sbalzi termici. Condizioni climatiche particolari che non hanno consentito alle api neanche di trovare nettare sufficiente da portare nell'alveare.E' questo l'allarme lanciato dalla Coldiretti sugli effetti del maltempo che rovina in Italia la giornata mondiale delle api che si festeggia il 20 maggio a livello planetario, dopo essere stata istituita dall'Onu nel 2018, per riconoscere il ruolo insostituibile svolto da questo insetto. Un ruolo così importante chesosteneva: ""Se l'ape scomparisse dalla faccia della Terra, all'uomo non resterebbero che quattro anni di vita"". La pazza primavera - sottolinea la Coldiretti - ha creato gravi problemi agli alveari con il maltempo che ha compromesso molte fioriture e le api che non hanno la possibilità di raccogliere il nettare. Il poco miele che sono riuscite a produrre - spiega la Coldiretti - se lo mangiano per sopravvivere.La sofferenza delle api - precisa la Coldiretti - è uno degli effetti dei cambiamenti climatici in atto che sconvolgono la natura e si manifestano con la più elevata frequenza di eventi estremi con sfasamenti stagionali, precipitazioni brevi ed intense ed il rapido passaggio dal sole al maltempo. La pioggia no stop compromette il duro lavoro delle api e serve ora un rapido cambiamento del tempo per salvare gli alveari. Non si tratta solo della produzione del miele poiché prodotti come mele, pere, mandorle, agrumi, pesche, kiwi, castagne, ciliegie, albicocche, susine, meloni, cocomeri, pomodori, zucchine, soia, girasole e, colza - spiega la coldiretti - dipendono completamente o in parte dalle api per la produzione dei frutti. Ma le api sono utili anche per la produzione di carne con l'azione impollinatrice che svolgono nei confronti delle colture foraggere da seme come l'erba medica e il trifoglio, fondamentali per i prati destinati agli animali da allevamento. Anche la grande maggioranza delle colture orticole da seme, come l'aglio, la carota, i cavoli e la cipolla, si può riprodurre grazie alle api.Lo scorso anno la produzione nazionale finale - ricorda la coldiretti - è stata di 22.000 tonnellate grazie soprattutto al centro e al nord italia dove gli apicoltori hanno potuto tirare un sospiro di sollievo dopo molte annate negative mentre al sud l'andamento climatico ha pregiudicato i raccolti per tutto l'anno a partire dal miele di agrumi le cui rese sono state molto scarse, soprattutto in sicilia. In italia - spiega la Coldiretti - esistono più di 50 varietà di miele a seconda del tipo di ""pascolo"" delle api: dal miele di acacia al millefiori (che è tra i più diffusi), da quello di arancia a quello di castagno (più scuro e amarognolo), dal miele di tiglio a quello di melata, fino ai mieli da piante aromatiche come la lavanda, il timo e il rosmarino. Nelle campagne italiane - continua la coldiretti - ci sono 1,2 milioni gli alveari curati da 45.000 Apicoltori tra hobbisti e professionali con un valore stimato in più di 2 miliardi di euro per l'attività di impollinazione alle coltivazioni.Rilevanti sono le importazioni dall'estero che nel 2018 sono risultate pari a 27,8 milioni di chili in aumento del 18% rispetto all'anno precedente. Quasi la metà di tutto il miele estero in italia arriva da due soli paesi: Ungheria con oltre 11,3 milioni di chili e la Cina con 2,5 di chili ai vertici per l'insicurezza alimentare. ""Per evitare di portare in tavola prodotti provenienti dall'estero, spesso di bassa qualità occorre verificare con attenzione l'origine in etichetta oppure di rivolgersi direttamente ai produttori nelle aziende agricole, negli agriturismi o nei mercati di campagna amica"" consiglia il presidente della Coldiretti. Il miele prodotto sul territorio nazionale dove non sono ammesse coltivazioni ogm (a differenza di quanto avviene ad esempio in Cina) è riconoscibile attraverso l'etichettatura di origine obbligatoria fortemente sostenuta dalla coldiretti. La parola Italia deve essere obbligatoriamente presente sulle confezioni di miele raccolto interamente sul territorio nazionale mentre nel caso in cui il miele provenga da più paesi dell'Unione europea, l'etichetta - continua Coldiretti - deve riportare l'indicazione ""miscela di mieli originari della Ce""; se invece proviene da paesi extracomunitari deve esserci la scritta ""miscela di mieli non originari della Ce"", mentre se si tratta di un mix va scritto ""miscela di mieli originari e non originari della Ce""."
"“...as a climate scientist, I’m frightened every day. Watching our best projections of future climate is like watching a horror movie you can’t walk out of. And the worst part is the willful ignorance of the characters.”",https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/hot-planet/who-needs-halloween/,"In 2018, the idea that we need a special holiday to be scared feels a little strange. Zombies, vampires, and werewolves don’t seem so frightening when the real world provides us with Vladimir Putin, white supremacists, and greenhouse gas emissions. And trust me, as a climate scientist, I’m frightened every day. Watching our best projections of future climate is like watching a horror movie you can’t walk out of. And the worst part is the willful ignorance of the characters. I mean, who could be so stupid as to walk straight into a house they know is haunted?

We know a little bit about the horrors that await us in the climate haunted house—we did, after all, build it ourselves. Walk in to the entrance. Above the door is that most frightening of instruments—but not just any thermometer. This one is wrapped with a wet washcloth. It’s measuring something called the “wet bulb” temperature: a combination of heat and humidity—a quantity that’s predicted to rise dramatically as the climate changes. When the wet bulb temperature gets too high, it restricts the human body’s ability to cool itself off by sweating. When it exceeds about 80°F, people working outside run the risk of dangerous overheating. When it’s higher than 95°, you—even if you are healthy, lying down, and naked in the shade (and why would you not be?)—will be dead in six hours.

The hallway teems with rats, some the size of human infants. Climate change, it has been pointed out by skeptics, will be good for some species. And this turns out to be true, just not for humans. The shorter winters mean longer breeding seasons for urban rats, and they’re manifestly enjoying themselves. In these increasingly ideal breeding conditions, two rats can, within three years, turn in to almost half a billion.

The hallway leads back to the kitchen. It’s not well-stocked. Climate change has disrupted the food system. Earlier springs mean blooming fruits are more vulnerable to the occasional frost. Summers are longer, hotter, and drier, causing more crop failure. Heavier downpours carry agricultural runoff to already polluted lakes and rivers. But the most horrifying thing here is the refrigerator. Heat stress and drought associated with climate change have reduced global yields of barley and pushed up prices. There is no beer.

Off the hallway is the living room, where the TV blares news of war, conflict, and massive refugee movements. It’s made worse by the rise of demagogues who exploit even small-scale adversity by blaming large groups of other people. Why did we think “adaptation” to climate change would mean “carefully considering the facts and making sober, scientifically—informed decisions”? Based on historical precedent, that was always a long shot.

Walk through to the bedroom, where you’ll find the greatest horror of all. On the bed lies a person who, at first, looks healthy and serene. But she stares at the ceiling apathetically and does nothing. After walking through the haunted house, she’s too terrified to do anything. She’s never called her representative or senators. She’s never marched or petitioned or organized in her community. She didn’t even vote in the last election. And then you realize: the bedroom is an optical illusion, a hall of mirrors. The person in the bed is you.

We don’t have to live in a horror movie. In fact, if we focus only on scary things, we miss the true meaning of Halloween, which is to force small children into humiliating costumes for our amusement. My own toddler insists that he wants to be “a squid that helps people,” which mystifies his parents and reveals a poor understanding of cephalopod biology. But that kind little squid, and his pirate and dragon and pumpkin and monkey friends, are going to grow up to live in the house we build for them. I think we should at least try to chase the demons out first."
"For the first time, scientists have used a satellite to estimate how much methane is seeping into the atmosphere from Arctic lakes. 84% lower than previous estimates based on individual lakes.",https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07751-w,"These lakes in Siberia formed as permafrost melted.

For the first time, scientists have used a satellite to estimate how much methane is seeping into the atmosphere from Arctic lakes. Preliminary data presented this week at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington DC help to explain long-standing discrepancies between estimates of methane emissions from atmospheric measurements and data collected at individual lakes.

As icy permafrost melts to form lakes, microbes break down organic matter in the thawing ground beneath the water and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Researchers have measured the amount of methane seeping out of hundreds of lakes, one by one, but estimating emissions across the Arctic remains a challenge. Understanding how much methane is being released by these lakes is crucial to predicting how much permafrost emissions could exacerbate future climate change.

In an effort to solve this problem, a team led by Melanie Engram, a remote-sensing scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, turned to the synthetic-aperture radar measurements taken by Japan’s Advanced Land Observing Satellite. This type of radar measures changes in ground height.

Engram’s team found that the sensor aboard the Japanese satellite was sensitive enough to detect how constant streams of rising methane bubbles deform the surface of ice that forms on Arctic lakes in autumn and winter. “It’s really exciting,” she says. “We can see roughness in the ice — divots created by methane bubbles.”

The team compared the satellite data with field measurements of methane at 48 lakes, and then used the correlations they found to analyse emissions at more than 5,000 lakes in 5 regions across Alaska. “For the first time, we can move up from a handful of lakes and look across the landscape,” says Katey Walter Anthony, a biogeochemist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who helped to conduct the research.

Tracing gases

Finding better tools to estimate Arctic methane emissions will help scientists to bridge data gaps and improve projections from climate models, says Clayton Elder, a biogeochemist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Elder presented new findings at the meeting from a high-resolution airborne sensor that NASA has deployed as part of a decade-long field campaign to assess how climate change is affecting the Arctic. The data indicate that, across the region, much of the methane emitted by thawing permafrost on land comes from hot spots that surround Arctic lakes.

And Engram’s results suggest that previous research over-estimated how much methane was coming from many large lakes, partly because scientists have spent more time studying smaller lakes with relatively high emissions.

In a 2,000-square-kilometre area around the Barrow Peninsula in northern Alaska, for instance, the team calculated that lakes release an average of 0.6 grams of methane per square metre of water surface each year — which equates to around 141 kilograms of methane per square kilometre. That is about 84% lower than some previous estimates based on measurements at individual lakes, Engram says, but lines up well with estimates based on atmospheric measurements.

Previous modelling research by Walter Anthony and other scientists1 suggests that methane emissions from the formation of Arctic lakes could rise significantly as the planet warms during this century. The work, which assumes moderate global warming, projects that a spike in the amount of methane bubbling up in Arctic lakes would nearly triple the total emissions from permafrost — to the equivalent of nearly 19 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, or roughly half a year’s worth of global CO 2 emissions from industry.

Accounting for rapidly forming Arctic lakes in models that project future permafrost emissions is difficult, she says, “But this says we need to do it.”"

"Antarctica's ice will be lost before 2°C temperature rise, new study finds",https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/ancient-antarctic-ice-melt-increased-sea-levels-3-metres-%E2%80%93-and-it-could-happen,"Ancient Antarctic ice melt increased sea levels by 3+ metres – and it could happen again

Rising ocean temperatures drove the melting of Antarctic ice sheets and caused extreme sea level rise more than 100,000 years ago, a new international study led by UNSW Sydney shows.

Fine layers of ancient volcanic ash in the ice helped the team pinpoint when the mass melting took place. Image: AntarcticScience.com

Mass melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was a major cause of high sea levels during a period known as the Last Interglacial (129,000-116,000 years ago), an international team of scientists led by UNSW’s Chris Turney has found. The research was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).



The extreme ice loss caused a multi-metre rise in global mean sea levels – and it took less than 2˚C of ocean warming for it to occur.

“Not only did we lose a lot of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, but this happened very early during the Last Interglacial,” says Chris Turney, Professor in Earth and Climate Science at UNSW Sydney and lead author of the study.

Fine layers of ancient volcanic ash in the ice helped the team pinpoint when the mass melting took place. Alarmingly, the results indicated that most ice loss occurred within the first millennia, showing how sensitive the Antarctic is to higher temperatures.

“The melting was likely caused by less than 2°C ocean warming – and that's something that has major implications for the future, given the ocean temperature increase and West Antarctic melting that’s happening today,” Professor Turney says.

During the Last Interglacial, polar ocean temperatures were likely less than 2˚C warmer than today, making it a useful period to study how future global warming might affect ice dynamics and sea levels.

“This study shows that we would lose most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in a warmer world,” says Professor Turney.

In contrast to the East Antarctic Ice Sheet – which mostly sits on high ground – the West Antarctic sheet rests on the seabed. It’s fringed by large areas of floating ice, called ice shelves, that protect the central part of the sheet.

As warmer ocean water travels into cavities beneath the ice shelves, ice melts from below, thinning the shelves and making the central ice sheet highly vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures.

Going back in time

To undertake their research, Professor Turney and his team travelled to the Patriot Hills Blue Ice Area, a site located at the periphery of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with support from Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions (or ALE).

Blue ice areas are the perfect laboratory for scientists due to their unique topography – they are created by fierce, high-density katabatic winds. When these winds blow over mountains, they remove the top layer of snow and erode the exposed ice. As the ice is removed, ancient ice flows up to the surface, offering an insight into the ice sheet’s history.

While most Antarctic researchers drill down into the ice core to extract their samples, this team used a different method – horizontal ice core analysis.

“Instead of drilling kilometres into the ice, we can simply walk across a blue ice area and travel back through millennia. By taking samples of ice from the surface we are able to reconstruct what happened to this precious environment in the past,” Professor Turney says.

Through isotope measurements, the team discovered a gap in the ice sheet record immediately prior to the Last Interglacial. This period of missing ice coincides with the extreme sea level increase, suggesting rapid ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The volcanic ash, trace gas samples and ancient DNA from bacteria trapped in the ice all support this finding.

Learning from the Last Interglacial

Ice age cycles occur approximately every 100,000 years due to subtle changes in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. These ice ages are separated by warm interglacial periods. The Last Interglacial is the most recent warm period to our current interglacial period, the Holocene.

While human contribution to global warming makes the Holocene unique, the Last Interglacial remains a useful research point to understand how the planet responds to extreme change.

“The future is heading far beyond the range of anything we've seen observed in the scientific instrumental record of the last 150 years,” says Professor Turney. “We have to look further into the past if we’re going to manage future changes.”

During the Last Interglacial, global mean sea levels were between 6m and 9m higher than present day, although some scientists suspect this could have reached 11m.

The sea level rise in the Last Interglacial can’t be fully explained by the Greenland Ice Sheet melt, which accounted for a 2m increase, or ocean expansion from warmer temperatures and melting mountain glaciers, which are thought to have caused less than a 1m increase.

“We now have some of the first major evidence that West Antarctica melted and drove a large part of this sea level rise,” says Professor Turney.

An urgent need to minimise future warming

The severity of the ice loss suggests that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is highly sensitive to future ocean warming.

“The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is sitting in water, and today this water is getting warmer and warmer,” says Professor Turney, who is also a Chief Investigator of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH).

Using data gained from their fieldwork, the team ran model simulations to investigate how warming might affect the floating ice shelves. These shelves currently buttress the ice sheets and help slow the flow of ice off the continent.

The results suggest a 3.8m sea level rise during the first thousand years of a 2˚C warmer ocean. Most of the modelled sea level rise occurred after the loss of the ice shelves, which collapsed within the first two hundred years of higher temperatures.

The researchers are concerned that persistent high sea surface temperatures would prompt the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to melt, driving global sea levels even higher.

“The positive feedbacks between a warming ocean, ice shelf collapse, and ice sheet melt suggests that the West Antarctic may be vulnerable to passing a tipping point,” stressed Dr Zoë Thomas, co-author and ARC Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) Fellow at UNSW.

“As it reaches the tipping point, only a small increase in temperature could trigger abrupt ice sheet melt and a multi-metre rise in global sea level.”

At present, the consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013 report suggests that global sea level will rise between 40cm and 80cm over the next century, with Antarctica only contributing around 5cm of this.

The researchers are concerned that Antarctica’s contribution could be much greater than this.

“Recent projections suggest that the Antarctic contribution may be up to ten times higher than the IPCC forecast, which is deeply worrying,” says Professor Christopher Fogwill, co-author and Director of The Institute for Sustainable Futures at the UK University of Keele.

“Our study highlights that the Antarctic Ice Sheet may lie close to a tipping point, which once passed may commit us to rapid sea level rise for millennia to come. This underlines the urgent need to reduce and control greenhouse gas emissions that are driving warming today.”

Notably, the researchers warn that this tipping point may be closer than we think.

“The Paris Climate Agreement commits to restricting global warming to 2˚C, ideally 1.5˚C, this century,” says Professor Turney.

“Our findings show that we don’t want to get close to 2˚C warming.”

Professor Turney and his team hope to expand the research to confirm just how quickly the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to warming and which areas were first affected.

“We only tested one location, so we don’t know whether it was the first sector of Antarctica that melted, or whether it melted relatively late. How these changes in Antarctica impacted the rest of the world remains a huge unknown as the planet warms into the future” he says.

“Testing other locations will give us a better idea for the areas we really need to monitor as the planet continues to warm.”"
China's Millennials are sending nudes to secure microloans to buy food.,https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/kzv38w/millennials-in-china-are-using-nudes-to-secure-loans,"This article originally appeared on VICE Australia.

Microloan systems have revolutionized the way we shop. Desperate for the latest, very slightly updated iPhone? Sign up for a month-to-month plan and break that price tag down into manageable morsels. Always wanted a jacuzzi but too cash poor to pay for it? Sign up to Afterpay and for a series of $10 monthly installments you could have that tub paid off in 60 years.

It’s the way of the future, and Chinese millennials are diving in headfirst. According to the latest research from financial technology company Ant Financial, 45 million of the 170 million people born after 1990 in China have an Ant Check Later microloan account. They’re not just using them to buy big ticket items like TVs and Teslas, either—some fintech companies are also letting people pay for small daily purchases like burgers on a long-term, monthly installment basis.

In a country where cost of living is high and the chances of getting a credit card are relatively low, this new form of e-commerce has opened up a world of possibilities for a lot of Chinese millennials. Because it’s 2018, though, there’s also a dark side to the system. Sure, you can get a huge box of Oreos and pay it back in monthly installments of 41 cents over three years, or go jet ski-shopping with peanuts to your name. But first, you might have to send some nudes.

A number of dodgy lenders have realized that young shoppers are desperate for loans, and are demanding that customers hand over naked selfies as collateral. If the repayments aren’t made on time, the money lenders threaten to leak those selfies to the individual’s family and friends. Many also charge interest on the original loan, thus burying their victims further in debt and forcing them to send more pictures and videos. These kinds of transactions are known in China as “naked loan services.”

In 2016, a total of ten gigabits of nudes from 161 young women—all of who were holding their photo IDs—were leaked online by microlenders. Most of the victims were aged between 19 and 23, and typically borrowed sums of money between $1,000 and $2,000, according to state media outlet China Youth Daily. Others were reportedly given the option to do sex work in order to pay off their loan.

So rampant is the problem of naked loan services in China that last year the country’s financial regulators vowed to crack down on unlicensed microlenders, Reuters reports. A multi-ministry task force said that “Amid the rapid development of cash loans—while they have played a role in meeting the normal credit needs of some groups—problems such as over-lending, repeat borrowing, improper collection, abnormally high-interest rates, and privacy violations have become prominent.”

Since then, new rules have been introduced forbidding unlicensed organizations and individuals from conducting a lending business. Nonetheless, local media reports suggest that the problem is still rife on social media.

Trump White House quietly cancels NASA research verifying greenhouse gas cuts,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/trump-white-house-quietly-cancels-nasa-research-verifying-greenhouse-gas-cuts?fbclid=IwAR1w6zGGbvSYHuUlTkOJKNe_3YCkc4jEjXe3R6u9aDsccVrRb8v8jBcMb_U,"Trump White House quietly cancels NASA research verifying greenhouse gas cuts

You can't manage what you don't measure. The adage is especially relevant for climate-warming greenhouse gases, which are crucial to manage—and challenging to measure. In recent years, though, satellite and aircraft instruments have begun monitoring carbon dioxide and methane remotely, and NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), a $10-million-a-year research line, has helped stitch together observations of sources and sinks into high-resolution models of the planet's flows of carbon. Now, President Donald Trump's administration has quietly killed the CMS, Science has learned.

The move jeopardizes plans to verify the national emission cuts agreed to in the Paris climate accords, says Kelly Sims Gallagher, director of Tufts University's Center for International Environment and Resource Policy in Medford, Massachusetts. ""If you cannot measure emissions reductions, you cannot be confident that countries are adhering to the agreement,"" she says. Canceling the CMS ""is a grave mistake,"" she adds.

The White House has mounted a broad attack on climate science, repeatedly proposing cuts to NASA's earth science budget, including the CMS, and cancellations of climate missions such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3). Although Congress fended off the budget and mission cuts, a spending deal signed in March made no mention of the CMS. That allowed the administration's move to take effect, says Steve Cole, a NASA spokesperson in Washington, D.C. Cole says existing grants will be allowed to finish up, but no new research will be supported.

The agency declined to provide a reason for the cancellation beyond ""budget constraints and higher priorities within the science budget."" But the CMS is an obvious target for the Trump administration because of its association with climate treaties and its work to help foreign nations understand their emissions, says Phil Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. And, unlike the satellites that provide the data, the research line had no private contractor to lobby for it.

Many of the 65 projects supported by the CMS since 2010 focused on understanding the carbon locked up in forests. For example, the U.S. Forest Service has long operated the premier land-based global assessment of forest carbon, but the labor-intensive inventories of soil and timber did not extend to the remote interior of Alaska. With CMS financing, NASA scientists worked with the Forest Service to develop an aircraft-based laser imager to tally up forest carbon stocks. ""They've now completed an inventory of forest carbon in Alaska at a fraction of the cost,"" says George Hurtt, a carbon cycle researcher at the University of Maryland in College Park, who leads the CMS science team.

The program has also supported research to improve tropical forest carbon inventories. Many developing nations have been paid to prevent deforestation through mechanisms like the United Nations's REDD+ program, which is focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation . But the limited data and tools for monitoring tropical forest change often meant that claimed reductions were difficult to trust. Stephen Hagen, a senior scientist at Applied GeoSolutions in Newmarket, New Hampshire, was part of a team that with the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space developed laser-mapping tools to automatically detect new roads and gaps in tropical forests, monitoring that helped the Indonesian government apply for REDD+ funding. The end of the CMS is disappointing and ""means we're going to be less capable of tracking changes in carbon,"" Hagen says.

The CMS improved other carbon monitoring as well. It supported efforts by the city of Providence to combine multiple data sources into a picture of its greenhouse gas emissions, and identify ways to reduce them. It has tracked the dissolved carbon in the Mississippi River as it flows out into the ocean. And it has paid for researchers led by Daniel Jacob, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University, to refine their satellite-based observations of methane.

It's an ironic time to kill the program, Jacob says. NASA is planning several space-based carbon observatories, including the OCO-3, which is set to be mounted on the International Space Station later this year, and the Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory, due for launch early next decade. The CMS would help knit all these observations together. ""It would be a total shame to wind [it] down,"" Jacob says.

This type of research is likely to continue, Duffy adds, but leadership will pass to Europe, which already operates one carbon-monitoring satellite, with more on the way. ""We really shoot ourselves in the foot if we let other people develop the technology,"" he says, given how important the techniques will be in managing low-carbon economies in the future. Hurtt, meanwhile, holds out hope that NASA will restore the program. After all, he says, the problem isn't going away. ""The topic of climate mitigation and carbon monitoring is maybe not the highest priority now in the United States,"" he says. ""But it is almost everywhere else.""

Surely these are the end times: GOP demands emergency tax cut for the rich as deficit explodes,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/republicans-capital-gains-tax-cut,"A sitting U.S. president who can’t stop attacking black and brown people. A never-ending trade war that has necessitated more than one multibillion-dollar farm bailout. A humanitarian crisis on the border of his own state. These are just a handful of the many issues that Senator Ted Cruz could be focused on. Instead, he’s currently devoting his efforts to a much more important cause: demanding another tax cut for the rich, this time without Congress’s approval.

In a letter sent to Steve Mnuchin on Monday, the senator from Texas urged the Treasury Secretary to use his “authority” to index capital gains to inflation, a move that would almost exclusively benefit the mega-rich. Claiming, falsely, that the United States economy “has experienced historic levels of growth as a result of Congress and the current administration’s policies such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” Cruz insists that it is now crucial for the Treasury Department to adjust capital gains for inflation “so that everyday Americans can continue to enjoy better lives and livelihoods.” And by “everyday Americans,” he of course means (but doesn’t say) the spectacularly wealthy.

Missing from Cruz’s call for Mnuchin to use “executive authority” to end this “unfair” treatment of taxpayers, which was signed by 20 of his Republican colleagues, is the fact that, according to the Penn Wharton Budget model, a whopping 86% of the benefit of indexing capital gains to inflation would go to the 1 percent (and reduce annual tax revenue by an estimated $102 billion over a decade). Perhaps seeking to address this criticism, Cruz claimed that changing how capital gains are taxed “would…unlock capital for investment, increase wages, create new jobs, and grow the economy, benefiting Americans across all income levels.” In other words, he’s arguing that the executive branch should give the super-rich another tax cut and it’ll benefit everyone because of trickle-down economics which—checks notes—has never actually worked. Including in the case of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

In a sign of just how unpopular a tax cut for the rich sans Congressional approval would be, even Trump’s Treasury Secretary, née America’s Foreclosure King, reportedly isn’t into the idea:

Mnuchin, so far, has been hesitant to making the change, which Trump’s other top economic advisers support.

“Right now there’s no commitment to getting it done or not getting it done,” Mnuchin told Bloomberg News in an interview earlier this month. “It’s a policy that has been under consideration and remains under consideration.”

On the other hand, Trump has reportedly “told confidants...that he remains deeply invested in making the change,” and his National Economic Council chair, Larry Kudlow, has been pushing for it since he was hired. Also, as Bloomberg points out, “Trump is looking for issues to win favor with voters and donors during his 2020 reelection campaign,” so perhaps the rich will get another well-deserved break.

"The tragedy of our times is that the gathering collapse of our life support systems has coincided with the age of public disservice. Just as we need to rise above self-interest and short-termism, governments around the world now represent the meanest and dirtiest of special interests.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/07/fossil-fuel-lobby-pollute-politics-climate-crisis,"The tragedy of our times is that the gathering collapse of our life support systems has coincided with the age of public disservice. Just as we need to rise above self-interest and short-termism, governments around the world now represent the meanest and dirtiest of special interests. In the United Kingdom, the US, Brazil, Australia and many other nations, pollutocrats rule.

The Earth’s systems are breaking down at astonishing speed. Wildfires roar across Siberia and Alaska – biting, in many places, deep into peat soils, releasing plumes of carbon dioxide and methane that cause more global heating. In July alone, Arctic wildfires are reckoned to have released as much carbon into the atmosphere as Austria does in a year: already the vicious twister of climate feedbacks has begun to turn.

Torrents of meltwater pour from the Greenland ice cap, sweltering under a 15C temperature anomaly. Daily ice losses on this scale are 50 years ahead of schedule: they were forecast in the climate models for 2070. A paper in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that the thawing of permafrost in the Canadian High Arctic now exceeds the depths of melting projected by scientists for 2090.

In the US, legislators in 18 states have put forward bills criminalising protests against pipelines

While record temperatures in Europe last month caused discomfort and disruption, in south-west Asia they are starting to reach the point at which the human body hits its thermal limits. Ever wider tracts of the world will come to rely on air conditioning, not only for basic comfort but also for human survival: another feedback spiral, as air conditioning requires massive energy use. Those who cannot afford it will either move or die. Already, climate breakdown is driving more people from their homes than either poverty or conflict, while contributing to both these other factors.

A recent paper in Nature shows that we have little hope of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating unless we retire existing fossil fuel infrastructure. Even if no new gas or coal power plants, roads and airports are built, the carbon emissions from current installations are likely to push us past this threshold. Only by retiring some of this infrastructure before the end of its natural life could we secure a 50% chance of remaining within the temperature limit agreed in Paris in 2015. Yet, far from decommissioning this Earth-killing machine, almost everywhere governments and industry stoke its fires.

The oil and gas industry intends to spend $4.9tn over the next 10 years, exploring and developing new reserves, none of which we can afford to burn. According to the IMF, every year governments subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of $5tn – many times more than they spend on addressing our existential predicament. The US spends 10 times more on these mad subsidies than on its federal education budget. Last year, the world burned more fossil fuels than ever before.

An analysis by Barry Saxifrage in Canada’s National Observer shows that half the fossil fuels ever used by humans have been burned since 1990. While renewable and nuclear power supplies have also risen in this period, the gap between the production of fossil fuels and low-carbon energy has not been narrowing, but steadily widening. What counts, in seeking to prevent runaway global heating, is not the good things we start to do, but the bad things we cease to do. Shutting down fossil infrastructure requires government intervention.

But in many nations, governments intervene not to protect humanity from the existential threat of fossil fuels, but to protect the fossil fuel industry from the existential threat of public protest. In the US, legislators in 18 states have put forward bills criminalising protests against pipelines, seeking to crush democratic dissent on behalf of the oil industry. In June, Donald Trump’s administration proposed federal legislation that would jail people for up to 20 years for disrupting pipeline construction.

Global Witness reports that, in several nations, led by the Philippines, governments have incited the murder of environmental protesters. The process begins with rhetoric, demonising civil protest as extremism and terrorism, then shifts to legislation, criminalising attempts to protect the living planet. Criminalisation then helps legitimise physical assaults and murder. A similar demonisation has begun in Britain, with the publication by a dark money-funded lobby group, Policy Exchange, of a report smearing Extinction Rebellion. Like all such publications, it was given a series of major platforms by the BBC, which preserved its customary absence of curiosity about who funded it.

Secretly funded lobby groups – such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance, the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs – have supplied some of the key advisers to Boris Johnson’s government. He has also appointed Andrea Leadsom, an enthusiastic fracking advocate, to run the department responsible for climate policy, and Grant Shapps – who until last month chaired the British Infrastructure Group, which promotes the expansion of roads and airports – as transport secretary. Last week the Guardian revealed documents suggesting that the firm run by Johnson’s ally and adviser Lynton Crosby has produced unbranded Facebook ads on behalf of the coal industry.

What we see here looks like the denouement of the Pollution Paradox. Because the dirtiest industries attract the least public support, they have the greatest incentive to spend money on politics, to get the results they want and we don’t. They fund political parties, lobby groups and thinktanks, fake grassroots organisations and dark ads on social media. As a result, politics comes to be dominated by the dirtiest industries.

We are told to fear the “extremists” who protest against ecocide and challenge dirty industry and the dirty governments it buys. But the extremists we should fear are those who hold office.

"Suicide rates are rising across the US, especially in rural areas",https://www.zmescience.com/science/suicide-rate-usa-rural-8239281/,"Suicide is, sadly, becoming more common in America, especially in rural areas.

Image credits Engin Akyurt.

A new study from The Ohio State University found that suicide rates jumped by 41%, from an average of 15 per 100,000 residents to 21.2 per 100,000 between 2014 and 2016. The study evaluated national suicide data from 1999 to 2016 to provide a county-by-county picture of the suicide toll among adults.

It also highlights a cluster of factors, including lack of insurance and the prevalence of gun shops, that are associated with high suicide rates.

Highest where life is hardest

“While our findings are disheartening, we’re hopeful that they will help guide efforts to support Americans who are struggling, especially in rural areas where suicide has increased the most and the fastest,” said lead researcher Danielle Steelesmith, a postdoctoral fellow at Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center.

The study found that suicide rates were highest in the least-populous counties of the US, and in the areas where people have the lowest income and most limited access to resources. From 2014 through 2016, suicide rates were 17.6 per 100,000 in large metropolitan counties compared with 22 per 100,000 in rural counties. In urban areas, the team adds, counties with more guns shops tended to have higher rates of adult suicide.

All in all, counties in Western states including Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming tended to have the highest rates of suicide, as did the Appalachian states of Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, and those in the Ozarks, including Arkansas and Missouri.

“Suicide is so complex, and many factors contribute, but this research helps us understand the toll and some of the potential contributing influences based on geography, and that could drive better efforts to prevent these deaths,” said Steelesmith.

The study analyzed 453,577 suicides by adults (25 to 64 years old) from 1996 to 2016. Suicides were most common among men and those 45 to 54 years old. The team says adult suicide rates have increased between 2014 and 2016 despite a national prevention effort that kicked off in 2015, which aimed to reduce suicide rates by 20% by 2025.

Ohio State University.

The findings can help guide and bolster the effectiveness of suicide prevention efforts says Cynthia Fontanella, a study co-author and associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health at Ohio State.

“For example, all communities might benefit from strategies that enhance coping and problem-solving skills, strengthen economic support and identify and support those who are at risk for suicide,” Fontanella said.

She adds that the link between urban gun shops and higher suicide rates suggests they can be targeted to reduce access to the means people use to commit suicide. In rural areas, “deprivation” was a closely-related factor to suicide rates. Deprivation includes a cluster of conditions including underemployment, poverty, and low educational attainment.

Long-term and persistent poverty may be more entrenched in rural areas, the team explains, and economic opportunities more limited. Steelesmith adds that many rural Americans rely on jobs in agriculture and industries like coal mining, which are dwindling. They also suffer from a lack of support services that they may turn to in their time of need.

“In cities, you have a core of services that are much easier to get to in many cases. You may have better access to job assistance, food banks and nonprofits that might all contribute to less desperation among residents,” Steelesmith said.

High social fragmentation — which factors in levels of single-person households, rates of unmarried residents, and the impermanence of residents — and low social capital were also particularly pronounced in rural America, the team explains. Social capital is a measure of how connected or closely-knit a given society is.

Other factors associated with higher suicide rates included high percentages of veterans in a county and lower rates of insurance coverage.

Fontanella explains that people who live in rural America would particularly benefit from strategies designed to promote social connections. Community engagement activities that give residents the chance to interact and to become familiar with supportive resources in their area would be a good approach. Steelesmith adds that some states, particularly in the West, have large counties with great variability in terms of resident life experiences, for instance, so solutions need to be tailored for individual communities.

Who would have thought printing endless amounts of money will lead to collapse?,https://thefederalist.com/2020/08/31/economic-collapse-is-imminent-if-we-cant-stop-our-deficit-spending-spree/,"We’ve become accustomed to solving all our problems with more spending, but at what point must we question our national solvency?

Each year, dozens of perfectly functioning aircraft are flown in a controlled manner right into terrain. As we saw in January with the loss of Kobe Bryant, it is one of the most deadly types of aviation accidents, yet perhaps the one most easily avoided. So why does it happen?

Often it’s as simple as losing focus on position due to worsening weather, fatigue, or procedural errors. External pressures can lead to “continuation bias,” the desire to get there at all costs. The temptation is to believe the situation won’t be that bad or will improve, despite data to the contrary. So we fly onward, confident in our path and unaware of the danger ahead — until the end.

In life, as in aviation, calamity can occur when we fail to recognize risks and act on them. With our attention now focused largely on riots, what if one of the most important issues threatening our economic future, and thereby our nation, is being largely minimized or ignored? Have we neglected the risk of our national debt?

A Spending Spree Makes Our Problems Worse

Consider that when President Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard in 1971, the accumulated debt of the United States since the founding of the nation was about $400 billion, which equates to roughly $2.6 trillion in current dollars. To float government-mandated shutdowns over COVID-19, Congress passed the CARES Act at a price tag of $2 trillion.

Congress is negotiating another round of bailout spending that will likely cost between $1 trillion (Republicans) and $3 trillion (Democrats). Assuming the most conservative outcome of $1 trillion, that will put the total spent on shoring up the deliberately hobbled economy around $3 trillion. That means in the course of less than a year, to counter one pandemic, the United States has spent, and therefore borrowed, more than the total debt incurred from the time our Constitution was signed in 1787 to Nixon’s action in 1971.

It doesn’t take a Ph.D. in economics to understand the gravity of this kind of spending, but still, economists defend it to worried members of Congress on the basis that we have no choice. The airplane must keep flying, weather be damned. The experts are experts at minimizing risk. Perhaps we’ll suddenly experience growth rates not seen since the post-World War II period to climb our way out of this valley, or maybe rates will stay at historic lows.

We’ve become accustomed to addressing all our problems with more spending. When Barack Obama was inaugurated president in 2008, the federal debt had ballooned to $11 trillion. When Donald Trump arrived eight years later, it had almost doubled to $20 trillion. The debt clock now stands at $26,647,860,701,599 as I type this, soaring upward at a dizzying pace, and critically important “off balance sheet” liabilities for future obligations such as Social Security and Medicare have been estimated at triple that number. At what point must we question our national solvency?

Old habits are hard to break. In the post-gold-standard period, we’ve run deficits every year except for the 1998-2001 period (see chart below), while politicians avoid long-term questions about sustainability.

Graph: Federal Surplus or Deficit History

Voters Are Numb to the Numbers

Perhaps we voters are to blame. Congressional candidates reliably promise to bring home the bacon, just as we demand. Despite our “term limits” rhetoric, we faithfully send them back to D.C., over and over. Nobody wants to hear that entitlements cuts might be required to make things balance, nor do we have the political will to maintain debt ceilings. So we fly onward.

Graph: A History of Busted Debt Ceilings

A Gallup poll showed that from 2010 to 2019, when the debt mushroomed from $14 trillion to $23 trillion, the percentage of voters who cited the federal budget deficit as an issue they worry “a great deal” about fell from 64 percent to 50 percent.

Another Gallup poll taken as we rolled into the 2020 election year showed the deficit ranks 10th on the list of voters’ “extremely important” priorities, landing just behind “distribution of income and wealth in the U.S.” This means many voters believe the implosion of the dollar is less important than whether it’s redistributed. Democrats, in particular, ranked the issue near dead last.

For the average American, the verbiage of millions, billions, and trillions causes the whole thing to lose meaning. Who can contextualize so many digits? Does it matter, when the median individual income in the United States is roughly $34,000, and each taxpayer, 151 million of us, owes $176,000 to cover the debt (a figure itself growing rapidly)?

Our debt-to-GDP ratio, the common metric to assess taxpayers’ ability to cover the nation’s debt with productivity and output, is at a record 136 percent and climbing. What effect will the increased cost of servicing our debt has on our economic growth?

Nondiscretionary spending, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, federal retirements, and welfare programs, consumes an ever-greater portion of our national budget, growing from 29 percent to 62 percent over the last 50 years. According to the Heritage Foundation, the big three of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will consume all federal revenues by about 2050. At that point, every penny for discretionary items, including the military, law enforcement, education, transportation, and others, will have to be cut or borrowed.

Surely, human nature plays a part in the nation’s attitude toward this issue. Who fears that which they’ve never seen or experienced? Just eight months ago, none of us would have given a thought to the possibility of a pandemic, but events change us.

Don’t Fire Up the Printing Presses

As we move closer to Election Day, don’t count on either party volunteering to address this issue. They will kick the can down the road. But surely behind closed doors in congressional offices and the West Wing, some gather privately to discuss when the crash will occur and how to handle the fallout.

Obama’s Federal Reserve gave us a clue. Faced with a severely wounded economy after the 2008 financial crisis, the president needed the markets to stabilize. He wanted to force the trillions in cash sitting on the sidelines back into the equity markets, so the Fed lowered interest rates with a policy called “quantitative easing.” It was nothing more than printing stacks of money to buy back our own Treasury bonds, or the monetization of our debt.

Warning of such a scheme, economist John Maynard Keynes wrote, “There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”

Is it hard to imagine that when our debt ultimately becomes unmanageable, the same tactic might be used? When you own the printing presses, anything is possible. Americans will soon realize that each dollar printed dilutes the value of those they’ve tucked away in their savings accounts, their retirement accounts, and their homes. Doing this again to cover our national debts during a crisis would effectively represent the largest tax ever inflicted on Americans, and it would be implemented without a single congressional vote.

When that day comes, with the dollar plummeting and inflation pushing the price of milk and bread out of the range of affordability, look for the press to livestream the so-called peaceful protests. They will likely ask how we never saw it coming."
"This is what collapse looks like. It will happen slowly, quietly. At first only the poor will suffer. Then everyone.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/03/yazoo-backwater-mississippi-flooding-months,"﻿Dating back to late February, about 550,000 acres of land have been underwater in the rural Yazoo backwater area of the lower Mississippi delta. About half of the acreage is farmland, creating devastating effects in a region where agriculture is the lifeblood of the economy. While flooding in the region is common, this year’s floodwater has hung around longer than ever.

‘You do what has got to be done’

Carmen Hancock, James Hancock and Rodney Porter have spent the past five months helping their elderly neighbors survive in their homes surrounded by floodwater. “We’re living by the good Lord to do what’s right,” said James Hancock. “There’s a number of older people living in this neighborhood, and it’s just the right thing to do. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. That’s what I live by. You do what has to be done.”

Compounding the problem was a high Mississippi River, which remained near or above flood stage for the longest span since 1927. The perfect storm of historic rainfall and a high river resulted in a backwater flood that has lingered beyond anything the region has ever seen.

Only within with the past couple weeks has the water receded, and for the first time in nearly half a year, farmers are finally beginning to see their land re-emerge.

Threat to wetlands and wildlife

Efforts to prevent flooding in this region date back to 1941 when Congress approved the Yazoo Backwater Project. The multifaceted plan included a system of levees, canals and drainage structures. But one crucial element was never installed – drainage pumps that would push floodwaters out of the backwater area and eventually into the Mississippi River. Due to construction delays, the pumps were never built, and in 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) vetoed the pumps, citing a threat to wetlands and wildlife in this remote part of Mississippi.

‘I’ve never seen anything like this’

The 2019 flood has caused the EPA to review its veto decision, giving hope to many residents that the pumps will finally be installed. Situated in one of Mississippi’s most rural locations, most residents feel they have been left out of the national conversation about flooding in America.

“Because no one’s died from this, and we live in such a remote place, it doesn’t seem to be important to national news,” said Paul Hollis, a farmer from Rolling Fork and a local commission for the Mississippi levee board. “We want people to know how many acres of farm land are flooded, how many houses are destroyed and how much wildlife has been impacted by this.”"
No need to tell the public - Super fungus that kills nearly half of its victims in 90 days has spread globally!,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/no-need-to-tell-the-public-super-fungus-that-kills-nearly-half-of-its-victims-in,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - In May (2018), an elderly man was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery.

A blood test revealed he was infected with a newly discovered germ as deadly as it was mysterious. Doctors swiftly isolated him in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems and is quietly spreading across the globe.

Over the past five years, it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, swept through a hospital in Spain, forced a prestigious British medical centre to shut down its ICU, and taken root in India, Pakistan and South Africa.

Recently, it reached New York, New Jersey and Illinois, leading the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to add it to a list of germs deemed ""urgent threats"".

The man at Mount Sinai died after 90 days in the hospital, but the fungus did not. Tests showed it was everywhere in his room, so invasive that the hospital needed special cleaning equipment and had to rip out some of the ceiling and floor tiles to eradicate it.

""Everything was positive - the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,"" said Dr Scott Lorin, the hospital's president.

""The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive."" ""The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.""

Candida auris is so tenacious in part because it is impervious to major anti-fungal medications, making it a new example of one of the world's most intractable health threats: the rise of drug-resistant infections.

For decades, public health experts have warned that the overuse of antibiotics is reducing the effectiveness of drugs that have lengthened lifespans by curing bacterial infections once commonly fatal.

But lately, there has been an explosion of resistant fungi as well, adding a new and frightening dimension to a phenomenon that is undermining a pillar of modern medicine.

""It's an enormous problem,"" said Dr Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London and co-author of a recent scientific review on the rise of resistant fungi.

""We depend on being able to treat those patients with anti-fungals.""

Simply put, fungi, just like bacteria, are evolving defences to survive modern medicines.

Yet, even as world health leaders have pleaded for more restraint in prescribing anti-microbial drugs to combat bacteria and fungi - convening the United Nations General Assembly in 2016 to manage an emerging crisis - gluttonous overuse of them in hospitals, clinics and farming has continued.

Resistant germs are often called ""superbugs"", but this is simplistic because they do not typically kill everyone.

Instead, they are most lethal to people with immature or compromised immune systems, including newborns and the elderly, smokers, diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders who take steroids that suppress the body's defences.

Scientists say that unless more effective new medicines are developed and unnecessary use of anti-microbial drugs is sharply curbed, risk will spread to healthier populations.

A study the British government funded projects that if policies are not put in place to slow the rise of drug resistance, 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050, eclipsing the eight million expected to die that year from cancer.

In the United States, two million people contract resistant infections annually and 23,000 die from them, according to the official CDC estimate.

That number was based on 2010 figures; more recent estimates from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine put the death toll at 162,000. Worldwide fatalities from resistant infections are estimated at 700,000.

Antibiotics and anti-fungals are both essential to combat infections in people, but antibiotics are also used widely to prevent disease in farm animals, and anti-fungals are also applied to prevent agricultural plants from rotting.

Some scientists cite evidence that rampant use of fungicides on crops is contributing to the surge in drug-resistant fungi infecting humans.

Yet, as the problem grows, it is little understood by the public - in part because the very existence of resistant infections is often cloaked in secrecy.

With bacteria and fungi alike, hospitals and local governments are reluctant to disclose outbreaks for fear of being seen as infection hubs.

Even the CDC, under its agreement with states, is not allowed to make public the location or name of hospitals involved in outbreaks.

State governments have in many cases declined to publicly share information beyond acknowledging that they have had cases.

All the while, the germs are easily spread - carried on hands and equipment inside hospitals; ferried on meat and manure-fertilised vegetables from farms; transported across borders by travellers and on exports and imports; and transferred by patients from nursing home to hospital and back.

Candida auris, which infected the man at Mount Sinai, is one of dozens of dangerous bacteria and fungi that have developed resistance. Yet, like most of them, it is a threat that is virtually unknown to the public.

Other prominent strains of the fungus Candida - one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections in hospitals - have not developed significant resistance to drugs, but more than 90 per cent of Candida auris infections are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 per cent are resistant to two or more drugs, the CDC said.

Dr Lynn Sosa, Connecticut's deputy state epidemiologist, said she now sees Candida auris as the top threat among resistant infections. ""It's pretty much unbeatable and difficult to identity.""

Nearly half of patients who contract Candida auris die within 90 days, said the CDC. Yet the world's experts have not nailed down where it came from.

""It is a creature from the black lagoon,"" said Dr Tom Chiller, who heads the fungal branch at the CDC, which is spearheading a global detective effort to find treatments and stop the spread. ""It bubbled up and now it is everywhere.""

'NO NEED' TO TELL THE PUBLIC

In late 2015, Dr Johanna Rhodes, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London, got a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital, a British medical centre outside London. Candida auris had taken root there months earlier and the hospital could not clear it.

""'We have no idea where it's coming from. We've never heard of it. It's just spread like wildfire,'"" Dr Rhodes said she was told. She agreed to help the hospital identify the fungus' genetic profile and clean it from rooms.

Under her direction, hospital workers used a special device to spray aerosolised hydrogen peroxide around a room used for a patient with Candida auris, the theory being that the vapour would scour each nook and cranny.

They left the device going for a week. Then they put a ""settle plate"" in the middle of the room with a gel at the bottom that would serve as a place for any surviving microbes to grow, Dr Rhodes said.

Only one organism grew back. Candida auris.

It was spreading, but word of it was not.

The hospital, a speciality lung and heart centre that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe, alerted the British government and told infected patients, but made no public announcement.

""There was no need to put out a news release during the outbreak,"" said Mr Oliver Wilkinson, a spokesman for the hospital.

This hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world. Individual institutions and national, state and local governments have been reluctant to publicise outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients - or prospective ones.

Dr Silke Schelenz, Royal Brompton's infectious disease specialist, found the lack of urgency from the government and hospital in the early stages of the outbreak ""very, very frustrating"".

""They obviously didn't want to lose reputation,"" Dr Schelenz said. ""It hadn't impacted our surgical outcomes.""

By the end of June 2016, a scientific paper reported ""an ongoing outbreak of 50 Candida auris cases"" at Royal Brompton and the hospital took an extraordinary step - it shut down its ICU for 11 days, moving intensive care patients to another floor, again with no announcement.

Days later, the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem.

A headline in The Daily Telegraph warned, Intensive Care Unit Closed After Deadly New Superbug Emerges In The UK. Later research showed there were eventually 72 total cases, though some patients were only carriers and were not infected by the fungus.

Yet, the issue remained little known internationally, while an even bigger outbreak had begun in Valencia, Spain, at the 992-bed Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe.

There, unbeknown to the public or unaffected patients, 372 people were colonised - meaning they had the germ on their body, but were not sick with it - and 85 developed bloodstream infections.

A paper in the journal Mycoses reported that 41 per cent of the infected patients died within 30 days.

A statement from the hospital said it was not necessarily Candida auris that killed them.

""It is very difficult to discern whether patients die from the pathogen or with it, since they are patients with many underlying diseases and in very serious general condition,"" the statement said.

As with Royal Brompton, the hospital in Spain did not make any public announcement. It still has not.

One author of the article in Mycoses, a doctor at the hospital, said in an e-mail that the hospital did not want him to speak to journalists because it ""is concerned about the public image of the hospital"".

The secrecy infuriates patient advocates, who say people have a right to know if there is an outbreak, so they can decide whether to go to a hospital, particularly when dealing with a non-urgent matter, like elective surgery.

""Why the heck are we reading about an outbreak almost a year-and-a-half later - and not have it front-page news the day after it happens?"" said Dr Kevin Kavanagh, a physician in Kentucky and board chairman of Health Watch USA, a non-profit patient advocacy group.

""You wouldn't tolerate this at a restaurant with a food-poisoning outbreak.""

Health officials say that disclosing outbreaks frightens patients about a situation they can do nothing about, particularly when the risks are unclear.

""It's hard enough with these organisms for healthcare providers to wrap their heads around it,"" said Dr Anna Yaffee, a former CDC outbreak investigator who dealt with resistant infection outbreaks in Kentucky in which the hospitals were not publicly disclosed.

""It's really impossible to message to the public.""

Officials in London did alert the CDC to the Royal Brompton outbreak while it was occurring. And the CDC realised it needed to get the word to US hospitals.

On June 24, 2016, the CDC blasted a nationwide warning to hospitals and medical groups and set up an e-mail address, candidaauris@cdc.gov, to field queries.

Dr Snigdha Vallabhaneni, a key member of the fungal team, expected to get a trickle - ""maybe a message every month"".

Instead, within weeks, her inbox exploded.

COMING TO AMERICA

In the US, 587 cases of people having contracted Candida auris have been reported, concentrated with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois, said the CDC.

The symptoms - fever, aches and fatigue - are seemingly ordinary, but when a person gets infected, particularly someone already unhealthy, such commonplace symptoms can be fatal.

The earliest known case in the US involved a woman who arrived at a New York hospital on May 6, 2013, seeking care for respiratory failure.

She was 61 and from the United Arab Emirates, and she died a week later, after testing positive for the fungus. At the time, the hospital had not thought much of it, but three years later, it sent the case to the CDC after reading the agency's June 2016 advisory.

This woman probably was not America's first Candida auris patient.

She carried a strain different from the South Asian one most common here. It killed a 56-year-old American woman who had travelled to India in March 2017 for elective abdominal surgery, contracted Candida auris and was airlifted back to a hospital in Connecticut that officials will not identify.

She was later transferred to a Texas hospital, where she died.

The germ has spread into long-term care facilities. In Chicago, 50 per cent of the residents at some nursing homes have tested positive for it, the CDC has reported. The fungus can grow on intravenous lines and ventilators.

Workers who care for patients infected with Candida auris worry for their own safety.

Dr Matthew McCarthy, who has treated several Candida auris patients at Weill Cornell Medical Centre in New York, described experiencing an unusual fear when treating a 30-year-old man.

""I found myself not wanting to touch the guy,"" he said. ""I didn't want to take it from the guy and bring it to someone else.""

He did his job and thoroughly examined the patient, but said: ""There was an overwhelming feeling of being terrified of accidentally picking it up on a sock or tie or gown.""

THE ROLE OF PESTICIDES?

As the CDC works to limit the spread of drug-resistant Candida auris, its investigators have been trying to answer the vexing question: Where in the world did it come from?

The first time doctors encountered Candida auris was in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009 (auris is Latin for ear). It seemed innocuous at the time, a cousin of common, easily treated fungal infections.

Three years later, it appeared in an unusual test result in the lab of Dr Jacques Meis, a microbiologist in Nijmegen, Netherlands, who was analysing a bloodstream infection in 18 patients from four hospitals in India.

Soon, new clusters of Candida auris seemed to emerge with each passing month in different parts of the world.

The CDC investigators theorised that Candida auris started in Asia and spread across the globe.

But when the agency compared the entire genome of auris samples from India, Pakistan, Venezuela, South Africa and Japan, it found that its origin was not a single place and there was not a single auris strain.

The genome sequencing showed that there were four distinctive versions of the fungus, with differences so profound they suggested that these strains had diverged thousands of years ago and emerged as resistant pathogens from harmless environmental strains in four different places at the same time.

""Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, seemed to spread and is drug-resistant, which is really mind-boggling,"" Dr Vallabhaneni said.

There are different theories as to what happened with Candida auris. Dr Meis, the Dutch researcher, said he believed that drug-resistant fungi were developing thanks to heavy use of fungicides on crops.

Dr Meis became intrigued by resistant fungi when he heard about the case of a 63-year-old patient in the Netherlands who died in 2005 from a fungus called Aspergillus.

It proved resistant to a front-line anti-fungal treatment called Itraconazole. That drug is a virtual copy of the azole pesticides that are used to dust crops the world over and account for more than one-third of all fungicide sales.

A 2013 paper in PLOS Pathogens journal said it appeared to be no coincidence that drug-resistant Aspergillus was showing up in the environment where the azole fungicides were used.

The fungus appeared in 12 per cent of Dutch soil samples, for example, but also in ""flower beds, compost, leaves, plant seeds, soil samples of tea gardens, padi fields, hospital surroundings and aerial samples of hospitals"".

Dr Meis visited the CDC last summer to share research and theorise that the same thing is happening with Candida auris, which is also found in the soil - azoles have created an environment so hostile that the fungi are evolving, with resistant strains surviving.

This is similar to concerns that resistant bacteria are growing because of excessive use of antibiotics in livestock for health and growth promotion. As with antibiotics in farm animals, azoles are used widely on crops.

""On everything - potatoes, beans, wheat, anything you can think of - tomatoes, onions,"" said Dr Rhodes, the infectious disease specialist who worked on the London outbreak. ""We are driving this with the use of anti-fungicides on crops.""

Dr Chiller theorises that Candida auris may have benefited from the heavy use of fungicides.

His idea is that it has existed for thousands of years, hidden in the world's crevices, a not particularly aggressive bug.

But as azoles began destroying more prevalent fungi, an opportunity arrived for it to enter the breach, a germ that had the ability to readily resist fungicides now suitable for a world in which fungi less able to resist are under attack.

The mystery of its emergence remains unsolved and its origin seems, for the moment, to be less important than stopping its spread.

RESISTANCE AND DENIAL

For now, the uncertainty around Candida auris has led to a climate of fear and, sometimes, denial.

Last spring, Ms Jasmine Cutler, 29, went to visit her 72-year-old father at a hospital in New York City, where he had been admitted because of complications from a surgery the previous month.

When she arrived at his room, she discovered that he had been sitting for at least an hour in a recliner, in his faeces, because no one had come when he had called for help to use the bathroom.

Ms Cutler said it became clear to her that the staff were afraid to touch him because a test had shown that he was carrying Candida auris.

""I saw doctors and nurses looking in the window of his room,"" she said. ""My father's not a guinea pig. You're not going to treat him like a freak at a show.""

He was eventually discharged and told he no longer carries the fungus. But he declined to be named, saying he feared being associated with the frightening infection."
The Working Class Is On The Cusp Of Rioting In The Streets,https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/04/27/delays-for-unemployment-no-food-people-talking-about-suicide/,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – Unemployment remains a major issue across the country.

Many New York and New Jersey residents are losing hope, and are out of cash.

Adam D’Aleo has listened to the New York Department of Labor’s “we are experiencing high call volume” recording more times than he can count.

“It’s embarrassing, I remember it,” D’Aleo said.

When he was laid off at the beginning of April, he filed for unemployment benefits online. Every time he logs in, he gets this notice: “To complete the claim, call the claims center.”

“It’s like calling into a radio station for, like, the 100th ticket, to be the 100th caller to get that ticket to see the concert. That’s what it is when you’re calling into the New York State Department of Labor,” D’Aleo told CBS2’s Jenna DeAngelis.

He went on Twitter and got a response from the Department of Labor telling him he was put on a callback list.

“Yes, I’m waiting for this call. but I don’t even know how this call is going to go, which is also another hurdle within itself that I’m nervous for,” D’Aleo said.

Meanwhile, he’s looking for a new job. He’s among 1.4 million New Yorkers who have filed for unemployment benefits in six weeks.

The Department of Labor says it launched a new web application with Google, has dedicated more than 3,000 representatives to answer phones, and has paid over $3 billion in unemployment benefits.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo was asked about unemployment Monday, and spoke about the need for federal help.

“We’re out of money now. We are now running a $10-15 billion deficit. We’re out of money now,” Cuomo said.

People DeAngelis spoke to want more answers from Cuomo and Gov. Phil Murphy, who Monday couldn’t answer why the unemployment site went down Sunday, impacting people like Maria Matos.

“Yesterday I tried to file between 8 and 9 in the morning. I couldn’t because the line was down. Checked every hour, the line was down all day,” said Colonia, N.J. resiednt Maria Matos.

“People can’t go six and seven weeks without money. You just simply can’t,” said Michelle Izzi.

Izzi created a Facebook page called #NJUnemploymentPandemic to help all those in need, including herself, get some answers. She’s one of more than 850,000 New Jersey workers who have filed for unemployment since March 15.

“People have no food. People are talking about suicide,” Izzi said. “We’re literally begging you, sir, please come out of your ivory tower, come down here in the trenches with your people and actually see what’s going on, answer us.”

“This will make… this will not make anyone feel any better, but we are leagues ahead of virtually every other state. But there’s still a backlog. I know folks are still frustrated. You won’t lose one penny, I promise you, including of your federal plus,” Murphy said.

The New Jersey Labor Department has distributed $1 billion in unemployment since mid-March.

How long will people have to wait for their share? That’s the question which remains unanswered."
A Vicious Feedback Loop | Climate Change Fueled the Australia Fires. Now Those Fires Are Fueling Climate Change.,https://grist.org/climate/climate-change-fueled-the-australia-fires-now-those-fires-are-fueling-climate-change/,"Australia is in the midst of a devastating wildfire season that is being exacerbated by climate change. But the fires, which have been burning for months and could rage on for months to come, are also impacting the earth’s climate in several ways. Some of those impacts are well understood, while others lie at the frontiers of scientific research.

The most obvious climatic impact of the fires is that they’re spewing millions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to a vicious feedback loop of heat and flame. But the fires are also kicking up lots of soot, creating a smoke plume that’s circling the globe and could hasten the melting of any glaciers it comes in contact with. Preliminary evidence suggests some of that smoke has even made its way into an upper layer of the atmosphere called the stratosphere, buoyed aloft by rare, fire-induced thunderclouds. That, too, could have subtle but far-reaching climate impacts.

The fires, which started burning at the end of Australia’s winter, raged across the eastern half of the country throughout the spring and kicked into high gear in the country’s populous southeast over the last few weeks. They’re a disaster of an unprecedented nature.

Exceptionally hot, dry, gusty weather, brought on by recurring ocean and atmospheric dynamics and amplified by the warming and drying effects of human-caused climate change, has made it all too easy for an errant match or a lightning strike to explode into a raging inferno. Which is exactly what’s been happening. To date, the Guardian estimates that more than 26 million acres of land have burned nationwide — a region larger than Indiana. That includes over 12 million acres in New South Wales alone, a dubious new record for the state.

Much of the land that’s burning is covered in eucalyptus forest, although flames have also razed farmlands, grasslands, heathlands, and even some patches of Queensland’s subtropical rainforests, said Lesley Hughes, an ecologist and climate scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney. Whatever the fuel source, the net effect on the atmosphere is a massive release of ash, dust, and a cocktail of different gases, including carbon dioxide.

From the start of September through early January, the wildfires released around 400 million tons of CO2, which is roughly the same amount the UK emits in an entire year, according to Mark Parrington, a senior scientist with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. That’s not a record, he said, noting that considerably more carbon was emitted in 2011 and 2012, when very large fires raged across Australia’s northern territory and out west. But in New South Wales, this year’s wildfire emissions are off the charts.

By any measure, 400 million tons is a significant chunk of heat-trapping gases that will get mixed into the atmosphere, fueling more global warming. “It’s a great example of a positive feedback of climate change,” Hughes said. “It all comes together, unfortunately.”

In addition to carbon pollution, the fires are producing, well, regular air pollution. Since early November, vast smoke plumes have been wafting from eastern Australia all the way across the Pacific to the shores of South America. Just this week, Parrington said, forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service showed carbon monoxide from wildfire smoke creeping into the South Atlantic, a “really clear indicator of just how intense those fires have been.”

As the smoke circumnavigates the globe, some of it is passing over New Zealand’s alpine glaciers, turning them an eerie caramel color. Lauren Vargo, a glaciologist at Victoria University of Wellington who recently traveled through New Zealand’s Southern Alps, said that the soot is “really clear and obvious” and that “most of the ice on the South Island” is likely to have been impacted. Vargo is currently studying aerial photographs of New Zealand’s glaciers going back to the 1970s. In 40 years of records, she hasn’t seen anything comparable.

Soot on glaciers does more than spoil hiking photos. It reduces the reflectivity, or albedo, of ice, allowing it to absorb more sunlight, which can hasten its melt, said Marie Dumont, the deputy scientific director of the French Meteorological Service’s Snow Research Center. Exactly how much extra melt New Zealand’s browning glaciers will experience over the coming weeks and months is unclear, but the fact that the color change is occurring during the summer, when the sunlight is fiercer and there’s less chance of fresh snow falling, isn’t a good sign.

“It’s super likely that it will accelerate the melt” of these glaciers, Dumont said, “at least for this year.” She added that she wouldn’t be surprised to see a similar, albeit smaller effect on some Patagonian glaciers, given that the wildfire smoke is passing over South America.

“With ice, when we are seeing a color change, it means the change in albedo is about 10 percent,” Dumont said. “That’s already huge. Even a 2 to 3 percent change is a lot.”

Not all of the wildfire smoke is settling on the earth’s surface. More of it is lingering 3 to 4 miles up in the troposphere, Parrington said, scattering light and resulting in ominous reddish sunsets. Where the smoke is densest, it’s likely impacting the weather, said Robert Field, a climate and atmospheric scientist at Columbia University. Over hard-hit parts of Australia, Field said he wouldn’t be surprised if temperatures are 10 to 20 degrees F lower on dense smoke days as soot blocks incoming sunlight. He emphasized, however, that any such effects will be very temporary.

Where the smoke might have a more far-reaching impact is in the stratosphere, a very dry, very cold part of the atmosphere that starts around 6 miles up and is home to fast-flowing jet stream winds. Pollution from the earth’s surface doesn’t often reach the stratosphere, but recent satellite data shows that Australia’s wildfire smoke has hit this lofty mark, a fact that speaks to “the power and intensity of the fires,” according to Claire Ryder, a research fellow at Reading University’s meteorology department.

The most likely explanation, she said, is fire-induced thunderclouds.

Also known as pyrocumulonimbus clouds, these menacing-looking storms, which form when heat from intense wildfires creates a powerful updraft, can blast particles into the stratosphere in a manner similar to a volcanic eruption. Over the past few weeks, the wildfires in southeastern Australia have spawned a series of pyrocumulonimbus events that Neil Lareau, a fire weather researcher at the University of Nevada Reno, called “really superlative.”

The smoke that’s reached the stratosphere may linger there for weeks to months, Ryder said. But exactly what impact it’ll have is an open scientific question.

Volcanic eruptions, she said, shoot tiny sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere. These particles reflect sunlight and can trigger temporary cooling at the earth’s surface. By contrast, fire smoke contains carbon-rich organic matter, including particles that are brown, gray, and even black in color. Black carbon, in particular, is a potent absorber of sunlight, and whether its presence in stratospheric soot will ultimately have a warming or cooling effect on the planet is unknown.

It will likely be years before scientists have teased out the full impact of this year’s wildfire season on the climate — first, the fires need to end. But it’s clear the effects have rippled far beyond Australia’s borders. As fire seasons become longer and more intense across the world, understanding this complex web of planetary impacts will only become more urgent."
"Convert half of UK farmland to nature to fight the climate crisis and restore wildlife, urges top scientist",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/31/convert-farmland-to-nature-climate-crisis,"Half of the nation’s farmland needs to be transformed into woodlands and natural habitat to fight the climate crisis and restore wildlife, according to a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government.

Prof Sir Ian Boyd said such a change could mean the amount of cattle and sheep would fall by 90%, with farmers instead being paid for storing carbon dioxide, helping prevent floods and providing beautiful landscapes where people could boost their health and wellbeing.

Boyd said the public were subsidising the livestock industry to produce huge environmental damage. The professor spent seven years at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs before stepping down in August. Half of farmland, mostly uplands and pasture, produces just 20% of the UK’s food and would be better for used other public goods, he said.

Boyd, who became vegetarian during his time in Defra, said farmers were potentially “sitting on a goldmine” in terms of the payments they could receive for growing trees and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

He said: “We need a large, radical transformation and we need to do it quickly, in the next decade. You can tick an immense number of boxes simultaneously.”

Farmers argue that uplands and pasture where livestock are reared cannot be used to grow crops. But Boyd said: “It would be much better to store carbon and water, grow trees and make the land available for people to improve their health and welfare.”

He said the 20% of food production lost by converting half of farmland could be made up by the development of vertical farms, where food is produced indoors in controlled and more efficient conditions. Boyd said: “I know there are big companies looking at how to really scale this up.”

A series of studies have concluded that people in rich nations need to eat much less meat to tackle the climate emergency and improve their health. “Most of the livestock production in the UK is unprofitable without public subsidy,” said Boyd. “The public are subsidising the production of livestock to produce huge environmental damages, all the way from greenhouse gas emissions to water pollution. Why should we continue to do that? It’s not sensible.

“If anybody asked me: ‘If there is one thing I can do to help save the planet, what would it be?’ I would say just eat a lot less meat. It’s the easiest thing to do. I’ve done it.”

People could reduce the meat they eat by 90% and have a perfectly balanced diet, Boyd said: “Freeing up 50% of the land would probably result in a reduction in the amount of livestock by about that amount, because it would be mostly livestock land we would be taking out of production.”

Farmers should be paid for changing the way land is used, he said. Current subsidies are largely based on the amount of land owned, but the government has pledged it will “move to a system based on public money for public goods” after the UK leaves the EU’s subsidy regime.

Farmland covers 70% of the UK, meaning that converting half to woodlands and parks would create new landscapes across a third of the country. In May, a report from Rewilding Britain called for a quarter of the nation to be returned to natural habitat.

The National Farmers Union recently published its plan to end the climate-heating emissions from agriculture by 2040. It said this could be done without cutting beef production or converting large areas of farmland into forest. Instead, the NFU said 75% of the UK’s agricultural emissions could be offset by growing plant fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide.

Responding to Boyd’s proposal, Guy Smith, the NFU’s deputy president, said: “Urgent action is needed to tackle the climate emergency. British farmers are already some of the most sustainable in the world. For example, the beef produced in Britain is already 2.5 times more efficient than the global average. And they are committed to doing even more.

“However, we will not halt climate change by curbing sustainable, British production and exporting it to countries which may not have the same climate ambition as we do here.”

Boyd said: “This proposal is not about being negative about farmers. It’s about being positive about their futures and helping them to adapt and continue providing support for society, but in a different way from in the past.”"
Donald Trump adds $1 trillion to national debt in 14 months,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/15/donald-trump-adds-1-trillion-national-debt-14-mont/?utm_source=onesignal&utm_campaign=pushnotify&utm_medium=push,"President Trump has now amassed his first $1 trillion in debt, crossing that ignominious mark late last week — and analysts said it’s just a taste of what’s to come after the tax-cuts and spending spree of recent months.

Indeed, his next $1 trillion could come within a year, and one analyst said he could soon be staring at $3 trillion annual deficits if things go particularly badly in interest rates.

It’s a major reversal for a president who during the campaign had said given eight years he could eliminate the debt entirely, but is instead looking at setting records for red ink.

“We are in for a rude awakening,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Her organization calculated that with December’s tax cuts and January’s budget-busting spending deal, Mr. Trump has already signed legislation that will add at least $2.4 trillion to the debt in the next decade and, should Congress make those policies permanent, could add as much as $6 trillion.

At that rate, the government will be paying $1 trillion a year in interest payments alone.

Mr. Trump at this time last year was crowing over the debt, which stood at $19.947 trillion and quickly dipped after his inauguration. He took to Twitter to demand credit.

“The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.,” he wrote.

But the tally hit $20.957 late last week and stood at $20.958 trillion as of Wednesday — the latest numbers available from the Treasury Department.

He’s not the fastest to add his first $1 trillion. That would be President Obama, who did it in little more than six months, after inheriting a recession and the Wall Street bailout from his predecessor.

But Mr. Trump’s nearly 14-month span is worse than Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and all who came before them.

After touting his early successes Mr. Trump has gone silent this year.

He’s mentioned the debt just once, in passing and in relation to the country’s trade deficits, in his public appearances.

The White House budget office also didn’t respond to requests for comment Thursday about the increase or the worrying trajectory.

Analysts said presidents inherit the economy and policies of their predecessors — in Mr. Obama’s case, a recession and the ongoing Wall Street bailout — so the early debt figures don’t necessarily reflect the new administration.

But they also said Mr. Trump’s comments last year leave him open to the examination.

“The fact that we have now hit $1 trillion in additions to the total debt isn’t something he should be entirely accountable for, but it is a standard he put out there,” Ms. MacGuineas said.

What the president will have to answer for, she and other analysts said, is December’s tax cuts and January’s budget deal, which will combine for a hole trillions of dollars deeper than it would have been otherwise.

Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, said the tax and spending bills will add about $3 trillion to the debt, in addition to $10 trillion already baked in from previous government spending patterns.

“I project the budget deficit will top $1 trillion by next year, and reach $2 trillion within a decade – or even approach a staggering $3 trillion if interest rates rise back to 1990s levels,” he said.

There’s little sense that anything will change.

Mr. Trump’s budget director has said the president won’t consider changes to Social Security or Medicare. And when House Speaker Paul D. Ryan suggested in December that the GOP would use the fast-track budget process to attempt those changes, his idea was quickly batted down by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Yet the consequences of inaction could be serious.

In an open Senate hearing last month about the security challenges facing the U.S., Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats called exploding red ink a “dire threat” to the country. That put it on par with problems such as international terrorism and cyber warfare.

The Congressional Budget Office regularly issues warning to Congress that debt will eventually begin to crowd out private investment and there could come a point at which others become reluctant to purchase U.S. government debt.

But new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress last month that’s “not this time, by a long shot.”

“There could come a time where the public, the global debt buying public would come to the view that we either weren’t prepared to honor our debts or we couldn’t service them. But we’re a long way from that,” he said.

"America's hospitals will be overrun in just eight days, Obama's medicare boss warns",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8112063/America-braces-coronvirus-collapse-100-00-ICU-beds-10-MILLION-hospitalized.html,"America's hospitals will be overrun with coronavirus patients in just eight days and face months of strain, according to Obama's former Medicare boss.

Andy Slavitt, former Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, issued the dire warning on Twitter on Saturday along with a string of advice for the public, governments and health workers.

'Last night I was on with state & local officials around the US well into the night.

'By March 23 many of our largest cities & hospitals are on course to be overrun with cases,' he wrote.

Slavitt then listed highlights from the memo he had prepared which included telling people to self-isolate now, closing bars and restaurants, frantically sourcing medical supplies 'even from the black market' if necessary and gearing up for the 'tsunami' of patients that will soon arrive at hospitals.

'The stakes are higher than any most of us have ever experienced: wars, 9/11, whatever,' he later added.

MEDICARE BOSS'S FULL MEMO Advertisement

As of Saturday morning, there were more than confirmed 2,200 cases of COVID-19 in the US and 50 people had died from it but doctors are warning there are more like 500,000 already infected and that we just do not know it yer because so few people have been tested.

Andy Slavitt, Obama's medicare boss

Dr. Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, said that was likely a gross under-representation of the true scale.

'Don’t believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus. No, that means 1,600 got the test, tested positive.

'There are probably 25 to 50 people who have the virus for every one person who is confirmed.

'I think we have between 50,000 and half a million cases right now walking around in the United States,' he told Yahoo Finance.

Dr. Makary urged people to be more vigilant.

'I’m concerned when I hear a neighbor or a friend say that they’re planning to go to a kid’s swim meet in three weeks or going on vacation next week.

'No — we’re about to experience the worst public health epidemic since polio,' he said starkly.

The estimate of how many more people are going to become infected ranges wildly but congress's doctor has said as many as 150million people may become infected, and Johns Hopkins says as many as 10million may need to be hospitalized because of it.

NEW YORK CONFIRMS FIRST DEATH - AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO HAD EMPHYSEMA New York confirmed its first coronavirus death on Saturday, an elderly woman who had advanced emphysema when she was admitted to the hospital last week. Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement: 'Today, we are confirming our first death due to severe complications from COVID-19. 'The patient, an elderly woman with advanced emphysema, was admitted to the hospital last week as one of our first cases, and had been in critical condition ever since. 'We’ve known from the outset that these people are the most at risk in this pandemic, and today’s news is a sad confirmation of that reality. 'I want to thank the staff of Wyckoff Medical Center for their efforts to save this woman’s life, and all the medical professionals on the front lines protecting our most vulnerable. 'We all have a part to play here. I ask every New Yorker to do their part and take the necessary precautionary measures to protect the people most at risk' Advertisement

The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that 38 million Americans will need medical care for COVID-19.

Of that number, as many as 9.6 million will need to be hospitalized and about a third of them - some 3million - will need ICU-level care.

There are only 100,000 ICU beds in America and 790,000 ordinary beds across the country. Not all of those people will need to be hospitalized at the same time, and experts say the crisis could last up to nine months.

But hospitals are not sitting empty, waiting for severe cases of coronavirus patients to arrive. Many are still busy with flu patients, some of whom require intense levels of care.

'This is going to be a fairly tremendous strain on our health system,' Dr. William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said.

Dr. Gabriel Cade of Blue Ridge Regional said: 'We've got to expect that this is going to be bad. The situation in Italy is a huge eye-opener.'

A 'moderate' outbreak could result in 200,000 patients needing intensive care, Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency medicine specialist at George Washington said.

'The U.S. only has 100,000 intensive care beds, and most are already occupied. If tens of thousands become sick at once, people will simply not receive the care that they need,' she said.

Aside from people needing intensive care, USA Today predicts that there will be six people fighting for every ordinary hospital bed when the outbreak peaks.

But before anyone is admitted to the hospital, the testing phase needs to be completed.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said earlier this week that he was going to look at turning shuttered public venues into make-shift hospitals to treat the sick.

Trump's national emergency declaration on Friday allows hospitals to make fast decisions about hiring, freeing up hospital beds and resourcing supplies.

Trump tweeted on Saturday that he would be attending meetings in the White House all day

It also allows medical personnel to travel and work between states. Many doctors and nurses are coming out of retirement to help in the crisis

From the beginning of the outbreak, there has been consistent criticism of the way the government has handled testing.

As more tests are finally rolled out across the country over the coming weeks and months, there will be a surge in the number of positive cases.

To try to stop the spread, Trump has closed the border with Europe and people in the US are being told to practice social distancing.

On Saturday, he tweeted: 'Attending meetings on Covid-19 in the White House. Working with States and local governments, many of whom have done a great job. Full report latter (sic)'

He later tweeted: 'SOCIAL DISTANCING!'

There have been fears over whether or not the president himself has come into contact with the virus. Several people he has come into contact with over the last few weeks have tested positive for the virus.

At a press conference on Friday where he declared a national state of emergency, he shook hands with several of the people who had joined him to deliver information on a plan.

BILL PASSED TO BEAT CORONAVIRUS

A coronavirus economic aid bill was passed by 363 votes to 40 by the House of Representatives in the early hours of Saturday morning after receiving support from President Trump who declared a national emergency because of the coronavirus on Friday afternoon.

The sweeping relief package includes two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave as the coronavirus is now confirmed in 49 states. West Virginia is the only state not to have a case by Friday evening.

Trump threw his support behind the legislation which faced a vote in the House early Saturday morning, after announcing a national emergency over coronavirus and later designating this Sunday, March 15, a National Prayer Day.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday announced the deal with the Trump administration for an aid package from Congress that would provide free tests even for the uninsured, enhanced unemployment benefits by boosting food stamps, and federal funds for Medicaid.

It will also bolster food programs with additional food aid.

Additionally it will include two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave for Americans who work for businesses with less than 500 employees or the government and are infected by the virus.

The bill was passed by the House in a post-midnight vote on Saturday morning after a last-minute push to get details agreed. It will now go to a vote in the Senate when it returns next week.

Amid concerns from Republicans on Friday, who claimed they would not vote for the response bill without being sure of Trump's support, the president encouraged both parties to vote yes.

'I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers,' Trump tweeted.

'I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will Small Businesses be hurt. I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!

'I will always put the health and well-being of American families FIRST. Look forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!' he added."
"NASA: Greenland’s ice melt is accelerating, aligning with ‘worst case’ projections",https://www.clickondetroit.com/weather/2019/12/11/nasa-greenlands-ice-melt-is-accelerating-aligning-with-worst-case-projections/,"The Greenland Ice Sheet is rapidly melting, having lost 3.8 trillion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018, a new study from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) finds.

The study combined twenty-six independent satellite datasets to track global warming’s effect on Greenland, one of the largest ice sheets on Earth, and the ice sheet melt’s impact on rising sea levels.

The findings, which forecast an approximate three-to-five inches of global sea level rise by 2100, are in alignment with previous worst-case projections if the average rate of Greenland’s ice loss continues.

Changes to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are of considerable societal importance, as they directly impact global sea levels, which are a result of climate change. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, they add more water to the ocean. Increasing rates of global warming have accelerated Greenland's ice mass loss from 25 billion tons per year in the 1990s to a current average of 234 billion tons per year. This means that Greenland's ice is melting on average seven times faster today than it was at the beginning of the study period. The Greenland Ice Sheet holds enough water to raise the sea level by twenty-four feet.

The paper, published December 10th in Nature, is the result of an international collaboration between eighty-nine polar scientists from fifty scientific institutions supported by NASA and ESA. The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise, or IMBIE, used well-calibrated data from thirteen NASA and ESA satellite missions to create the most accurate measurements of ice loss to date. The team found that half of the loss is tied to surface ice melting in warmer air. The rest of the loss is the result of factors such as warmer ocean temperatures, iceberg calving and the ice sheet shedding ice into the ocean more quickly.

""There are climate projections that are based on models of varying levels of complexity and observations, but they have large uncertainties. Our study is purely an observational one that tests those uncertainties. Therefore, we have irrefutable evidence that we seem to be on track with one of the most pessimistic sea level rise scenarios,"" said Erik Ivins, second author and lead scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Greenland is home to the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. The sheet covers three-fourths of Greenland's land mass. But in the last twenty-six years, Greenland's melting ice has added 0.4 inches to sea level rise. Its cumulative 3.8 trillion tons of melted ice is equivalent to adding the water from 120 million Olympic-size swimming pools to the ocean every year, for twenty-six years.

""As a rule of thumb, for every centimeter rise in global sea level, another six million people are exposed to coastal flooding around the planet,"" said Andrew Shepherd, lead author and scientist from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. ""On current trends, Greenland ice melting will cause 100 million people to be flooded each year by the end of the century, so 400 million in total due to sea level rise.""

In addition to storm surges and high tides that will increase flooding in many regions, sea level rise exacerbates events like hurricanes. Another important fact to consider is that Greenland's shrinking ice sheet also speeds up global warming. The vast expanse of snow and ice helps cool down Earth by reflecting the Sun's rays back into space. As the ice melts and retreats, the region absorbs more solar radiation, which warms the planet. So, the planet’s warming is reducing Greenland ice which, in turn, will accelerate the planet’s warming.

The new study will contribute to the evaluation and evolution of sea level rise models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in evaluating risks to current and future populations. The results of the study currently appear consistent with the panel's worst-case projections for sea level rise in the next eighty years.

""The full set of consequences of future melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet remain uncertain, but even a small increase in sea level can have devastating effects on ports and coastal zones, cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, and aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt,"" said Ivins.

This is the third IMBIE study on ice loss as a result of global warming. IMBIE’s first report in 2012 measured both Greenland and Antarctica’s shrinking ice sheets, finding that the combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland had increased over time and that the ice sheets were losing three times as much ice as they were in the early 1990s. Antarctica and Greenland continue to lose ice today, and that rate of loss has accelerated since the first IMBIE study."
Best Carbon Capture Facility In World Emits 25 Times More CO2 Than Sequestered,https://cleantechnica.com/2019/06/12/best-carbon-capture-facility-in-world-emits-25-times-more-co2-than-sequestered/amp/,"Best Carbon Capture Facility In World Emits 25 Times More CO2 Than Sequestered

June 12th, 2019 by Michael Barnard

CleanTechnica has been publishing a series of my analyses on carbon capture and sequestration technologies over the past year, as well as some additional pieces. Two pieces on soil carbon capture and carbon farming have made the list, pointing out that these are beneficial, but incredibly slow and so while worth doing do not mean we can keep emitting greenhouse gases. I also published on the scale problem of carbon capture, in that to get a ton of CO2 you have to filter it out of a Houston Astrodome of air, and the Grand Canyon only contains about 1,270 tons of it.

Then there are the nine articles (so far) on the current darling of the air carbon capture or direct air capture crowd, Carbon Engineering. The first five start here, the three specifically on air-to-fuel start here and the last one on the expected use of pumping more oil and creating more greenhouse gases is here. That series showed that there’s no green in air carbon capture the way that Carbon Engineering is doing it, but that there are small niches where much wiser solutions like Global Thermostat’s make sense. That series showed in gory detail that mechanical air carbon capture is going to be a tiny wedge in the fight against global warming, so small as to be worth ignoring, regardless of the headlines that the fossil fuel industry’s PR flaks and the Global CCS institute (a subset of the PR flaks) are pumping into media sites. (As a note, I spent 90 minutes this week talking carbon capture and Carbon Engineering in specific with a CNBC crew that flew into BC to meet the CE team in Squamish and me in Vancouver. Film at 11.)

One of the articles looked at the 50-year history of mechanical carbon capture efforts, all entirely tied to the fossil fuel industry, most just used to pump more oil out of played out oil wells as enhanced oil recovery approaches. The assessment showed that virtually no CO2 by global standards has been captured by CCS and that a single year’s output of current wind and solar farms are avoiding 35 times the CO2 that has been ‘captured’ over 50 years of CCS history. Basically, all CCS is a rounding error on the actual solution, just stop emitting CO2.

But one of the global examples stood out, the Norwegian Equinor (nee Statoil) Sleipner facility in the North Sea.

It’s an amazing outlier in multiple ways. First off, it was put into operation in 1996, making it much older than most of the facilities. Second, it wasn’t being used for enhanced oil recovery, but was actually sequestering CO2 as far as can be told. Third, it has been in continual operation for 23 years and sequestering about a million tons of CO2 a year, leading to it being the biggest actual sequestration facility in the world. (The US Shute Creek facility is just being used to pump more oil, and as a result is at very best achieve 20% of its claimed sequestration.) Finally, it was dirt cheap by CCS standards, with a recorded capital cost of less than $30 million, compared to billions on some failed US efforts.

Sadly, things don’t look as rosy under the covers as they do. This isn’t the magic bullet on how to successfully and cheaply sequester CO2 that it looks like.

Sleipner’s CO2 doesn’t magically appear before being sequestered. It’s part of the natural gas that they pump out of fields offshore from Norway in the North Sea. The gas contains 9% CO2, more than is allowed in the natural gas distribution network. They can’t sell it as is.

Carbon dioxide is stripped from natural gas with amine solvents and is deposited in a saline formation. The carbon dioxide is a waste product of the field’s natural gas production. Storing it underground avoids this problem and saves Statoil hundreds of millions of euros in carbon taxes. Sleipner stores about one million tons of CO2 a year, so has stored about 23 million tons. Given the price point, that looks close to a dollar per ton, which is an astounding figure when Australia’s history is about $4,300 AUD per ton, and the USA’s history is worse.

Basically they couldn’t sell the natural gas without getting rid of the CO2 and they had to do something with it. Norway had a carbon tax even in 1996, so it made economic sense for Statoil to sequester it instead of just venting it to the atmosphere. They had to build most of the capability regardless, so I’m pretty sure the represented cost is just the extra cost of injection on top of what they had to do anyway.

But this is the kicker. All the natural gas that they are shipping turns into a whole lot more CO2. The math is straightforward. For every 1000 kg of natural gas, they grab 90 kg of CO2 and sequester it. Assuming zero leaks, the 910 kg of natural gas is burned by customers, producing a bit over 2500 kg of CO2. Net CO2 emissions are approximately 2410 kg for every 1000 kg of natural gas they pump out of the ground.

What does that turn into in terms of real tons of CO2 sequestered vs emitted? Well, they are producing 36 million cubic meters of natural gas per day. They’ve been producing that daily since 1996, so that’s about 300 billion cubic meters of gas. That turns into about 581 million tons of CO2 emitted by the natural gas, compared to the 23 million tons of CO2 that’s been sequestered.

That’s over 25 times more CO2 in the atmosphere than was sequestered. And Equinor is being paid for the natural gas and the sequestered CO2. Nice work if you can get it. Not so nice for the planet.

Every other carbon capture facility in the world is more expensive, sequesters less CO2, and has a much worse ratio than 25:1 for emitted vs captured. The fossil fuel industry and consumers of fossil fuels are producing vastly more CO2 emissions than the very best sequestration case study can manage.

“Terrifying” Climate Impacts 626% Worse Than Expected for Intact Forest Loss,https://scitechdaily.com/terrifying-climate-impacts-626-worse-than-expected-for-intact-forest-loss/?fbclid=IwAR04vIgXfnd3Uc2l7nXy1bHlH4NYXxCOs5cVvKM_J0NuLg5fC_rCh0-6Cgk,"The impact of losing intact tropical forests is more devastating on the climate than previously thought, according to University of Queensland-led research.

The international study has revealed between 2000 and 2013 the clearance of intact tropical forests resulted in a much higher level of carbon being emitted to the atmosphere than first believed – resulting in a 626 percent increase in the calculated impact on climate.

UQ conservation scientist Dr Sean Maxwell said this difference equated to two years of global land-use change emissions, and was previously unaccounted for due to a lack of full carbon accounting.

“Usually only ‘pulse’ emissions are considered – these are emissions released the instant intact forest is destroyed,” Dr. Maxwell said. “Our analysis considers all impacts such as the effects of selective logging, forgone carbon sequestration, expanding effects on the edges of forests, and species extinction.

“We were shocked to see that when considering all of the available factors, the net carbon impact was more than six times worse for the climate.”

The researchers analyzed maps of intact forest clearing across the tropics between 2000 and 2013, then calculated the areas’ pulse emissions and simulated the impact of previously unrecorded factors.

“We could see where selective logging was occurring based on where new roads have been built, the extent of new forest edges based on where deforestation had recently occurred, and the loss of large seed-dispersing animals due to them becoming more susceptible to hunting,” Dr. Maxwell said.

“The team then estimated the amount of carbon that these processes will release into the atmosphere between 2013 and 2050, labeling it ‘committed emissions’. “By comparing ‘pulse’ and ‘committed emissions’ with what these forests could have removed from the atmosphere if they’d remained intact until 2050, we determined the real impacts of deforestation.”

UQ and Wildlife Conservation Society’s Professor James Watson said the study’s approach better captured the true carbon impact of intact forest loss.

“Losing Earth’s remaining wilderness is devastating by itself, but climate impacts 626 percent greater than expected is terrifying,” Professor Watson said. “Humanity needs to better fund the conservation of intact forests, especially now we’ve shown their larger-than-realized role in stabilizing the climate. Our study will hopefully mobilize more funding from the climate finance sector, improving and expanding efforts to retain intact forests across the tropics.”

Dr. Maxwell said that Indigenous peoples and local communities will increasingly play a central role in efforts to improve and expand forest conservation.

“Intact forests are often critical to the material and spiritual aspects of traditional cultures,” he said. “Strengthening the land tenure of Indigenous and traditional peoples is a powerful way to protect intact forests.”

U.N. Predicts Disaster if Global Warming Not Checked - an article from 1989 highlighting just how far the goalposts have been moved and how accurate predictions were even 30 years ago,https://www.apnews.com/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.

Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ″eco- refugees,′ ′ threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, or UNEP.

He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control.

As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by up to three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat island nations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday.

Coastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh could be flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth of Egypt’s arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting off its food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study.

″Ecological refugees will become a major concern, and what’s worse is you may find that people can move to drier ground, but the soils and the natural resources may not support life. Africa doesn’t have to worry about land, but would you want to live in the Sahara?″ he said.

UNEP estimates it would cost the United States at least $100 billion to protect its east coast alone.

Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands, while the Soviet Union could reap bumper crops if it adapts its agriculture in time, according to a study by UNEP and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.

Excess carbon dioxide is pouring into the atmosphere because of humanity’s use of fossil fuels and burning of rain forests, the study says. The atmosphere is retaining more heat than it radiates, much like a greenhouse.

The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, said Brown.

The difference may seem slight, he said, but the planet is only 9 degrees warmer now than during the 8,000-year Ice Age that ended 10,000 years ago.

Brown said if the warming trend continues, ″the question is will we be able to reverse the process in time? We say that within the next 10 years, given the present loads that the atmosphere has to bear, we have an opportunity to start the stabilizing process.″

He said even the most conservative scientists ″already tell us there’s nothing we can do now to stop a ... change″ of about 3 degrees.

″Anything beyond that, and we have to start thinking about the significant rise of the sea levels ... we can expect more ferocious storms, hurricanes, wind shear, dust erosion.″

He said there is time to act, but there is no time to waste.

UNEP is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by the end of 1990, and the adoption of a global climate treaty by 1992. In May, delegates from 103 nations met in Nairobi, Kenya - where UNEP is based - and decided to open negotiations on the treaty next year.

Nations will be asked to reduce the use of fossil fuels, cut the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as methane and fluorocarbons, and preserve the rain forests.

″We have no clear idea about the ecological minimum of green space that the planet needs to function effectively. What we do know is that we are destroying the tropical rain forest at the rate of 50 acres a minute, about one football field per second,″ said Brown.

Each acre of rain forest can store 100 tons of carbon dioxide and reprocess it into oxygen.

Brown suggested that compensating Brazil, Indonesia and Kenya for preserving rain forests may be necessary.

The European Community istalking about a half-cent levy on each kilowatt- hour of fossil fuels to raise $55 million a year to protect the rain forests, and other direct subsidies may be possible, he said.

The treaty could also call for improved energy efficiency, increasing conservation, and for developed nations to transfer technology to Third World nations to help them save energy and cut greenhouse gas emissions, said Brown."
