Tuesday, August 18, 2015 11:27AM IST (5:57AM GMT) (BW)(SEIKO-INSTRUMENTS) Seiko Instruments (SII) Releases New LDO Regulator with Reset Function in Smaller Package for Automotive Applications - S-19311 Series allows customers to use TO-252-5S, a newly developed compact package with high heat dissipation - Chiba, Japan Seiko Instruments Inc. (SII) announced the release of the S-19311 Series automotive high input 36V LDO regulator with reset function, adopting a newly developed compact package TO-252-5S with high heat dissipation. The S-19311 can be connected directly to batteries, and the reset function allows for a reset signal to be sent when the LDO regulator voltage drops below a designated threshold. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150817005346/en/ The new TO-252-5S can be mounted on the existing pad area and has approximately the same dissipation as the industry-standard TO-252-5 (DPAK), however, the mounting area is reduced by 35% and the height has a near 50% reduction. An even more compact HSOP-8A package capable of high heat dissipation is also available. This IC is suitable for smaller automotive ECUs and typical applications include power supply for a microcontroller in a system directly connected to a battery. The S-19311 Series was specifically developed to meet the demanding high quality requirements for automotive use. The 36V maximum input voltage (rating 45V) and the operating temperature range up to 125 degrees C enable operation in high input voltage and high temperature applications such as engines. The IC can also withstand 45V load dump. The output and detection voltages are selectable in 0.1V steps. The output voltage (LDO regulator block) is also selectable from 3.0V to 5.3V in 0.1V steps with accuracy of ±2.0%, and the output current is 200mA. Customers can select the detection voltage (reset IC block) from 2.6V to 5.0V in 0.1V steps with accuracy of ±100mV and hysteresis width of 0.12V min. The current consumption is 60 uA typ. during operation. The packages are the lead-free and halogen-free TO-252-5S and HSOP-8A. The junction temperature range is from -40 to +150 degrees C, and AEC-Q100 is currently in process. The S-19311 Series has options available with a thermal simulation service which offers a suggestion of thermal resistance value and recommended wiring ratio to help customers select packages.
