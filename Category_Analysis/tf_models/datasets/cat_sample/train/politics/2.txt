4737679 Sunday night’s episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” revealed that Kris Jenner was fuming when Caitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair interview was published because he said she mistreated him during their marriage.
“We had this great life,” Kris told Kim Kardashian during the episode. “We had a great marriage, we had two great kids, we had a lot of fun. We raised babies. We had birthday parties. We traveled. We went to amazing ski events. Not one nice word.” (RELATED: Kris Jenner To Bruce: Why Get Married And Have Kids If You Wanted To Be A Woman?)

Later on, Kim complained to her sister’s boyfriend Scott Disick that Caitlyn didn’t apologize.
“The only thing she cared about was that her Twitter followers went up more in one day than Obama’s did,” Disick told Kim. “I’ll tell you why. Because the greatest athlete of all time turned into a fucking woman.” (PHOTOS: This Family Photo Kendall Jenner Shared Is A Little Awkward)
