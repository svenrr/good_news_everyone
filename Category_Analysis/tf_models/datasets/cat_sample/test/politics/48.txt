Virginia's borrowing rules leave room for about $1 billion in new construction debt over the next two years, and state agencies have identified more than $11.7 billion in projects. 
The tally comes from a Senate Finance Committee report presented Thursday, and the full wish list probably represents asks not just for the coming two-year budget cycle, but a year or two beyond that as well. The state's college and university system alone has $8 billion in construction on its list. 
Gov. Terry McAuliffe's administration is going through these projects now and will unveil a budget proposal in early December. Senate leaders, including Majority Leader Thomas K. "Tommy" Norment, said Thursday that none of the projects have jumped out as must haves, and that spending levels depend in part on what the state ends up spending on day-to-day operations. 
McAuliffe has promised to increase K-12 spending, for example. 
"Even though you've got the debt capacity, you've still got to do the debt service," said Norment, R-James City. "If he puts in a lot of new spending in … that's less money we have for debt service." The Shad Plank: Local Politics Blog Open link 
The state restricts its borrowing through a formula that takes annual revenue into account. That formula indicates the state could borrow somewhere between $459 million and $543 million a year over the next two years, according to a state treasurer's report. The numbers will be finalized later. 
The state could authorize far more debt – as much as $4.6 billion – if voters approved in a referendum, but the state hasn't taken that route since 2002. Norment and Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Ryan McDougle – both finance committee members – said they don't sense momentum for such a move this year. 
The Senate Finance Committee's staff shared a handful of potential projects with committee members Thursday during a pre-session budget presentation. The University of Virginia hopes for a new chemistry building that would cost $180 million, for example. 
The state's Behavioral Health and Developmental Services wants to replace Central State Hospital for $168 million. 
Christopher Newport University President Paul Trible asked legislators earlier this year for $47 million to expand the university's main library and $49 million for a new arts center. 
The College of William and Mary wants a $55 million music and arts center, with a 450-seat concert hall, a 125-seat recital hall and practice space for its music school.
