WASHINGTON — Texas Republicans said Thursday that they’ll stick together in the quest for a new House speaker, after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s abrupt withdrawal from the race reignited speculation that Dallas Rep. Jeb Hensarling could run.
“The goal is to keep us united and to get behind a conservative candidate — hopefully from Texas — who can unite the conference in a conservative way,” said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington.
Barton said he had a candidate in mind, but he wouldn’t say who. There are more House Republicans from Texas — 25 — than from any other state.
Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee and formerly the No. 4 House Republican, would not comment on his plans. He briefly considered a run after Speaker John Boehner announced Sept. 25 that he was resigning the post, effective at the end of October.
With McCarthy out, Boehner said he would remain speaker until a successor is chosen.
McCarthy’s surprise decision could freeze a leadership scramble that involved another Dallas Republican, Rep. Pete Sessions, who has been running for majority whip, the No. 3 post.
Sessions’ name also has been floated as a potential speaker candidate. He chairs the powerful Rules Committee and served two terms as chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, culminating in the party’s return to a House majority. Sessions’ spokeswoman declined to comment.
Texas Republicans huddled in a House conference room shortly after McCarthy’s announcement. Some told reporters that the delegation would unite behind a candidate and wants someone to serve through the end of 2016, not as a temporary caretaker.
Said Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth: “We had a shock today. We’re going to have to now elect someone as speaker who’s strong enough to lead us through this.”
Asked if that could be a Texan, Granger said, “It could be,” adding: “Texas will play a big part in this.”
Rep. John Ratcliffe of Heath said he would try to draft Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina before committing to a Texan. Gowdy, who has led the committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, has so far declined to run.
“This is all a very fluid situation,” said Ratcliffe, who said there were several Texans he would support. “If they enter race, I’ll consider them.”
Hensarling and 18 other House Republicans urged colleagues in a letter Thursday to “figure out what we are and where we are going” before rushing to pick a speaker.
“Too often decisions are made in a 24/7 news cycle where people do not have full information, and members are locked into a position that may very well change based on future circumstances,” they wrote.
