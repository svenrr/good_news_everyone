Opponents of HERO, organized as the so-called Campaign For Houston, have been escalating their rhetoric demonizing the LGBT community, and a new ad demonstrates just how far theyre willing to go to suggest that transgender women are violent sexual predators. A new ad spot posted on YouTube Monday shows a little girl entering a restroom. Any man at any time could enter a womens bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day, the ad falsely claims. Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom. As a man sneaks out of a separate stall and enters the girls stall, the ad ironically claims that HERO goes too far. Watch it: The extreme fearmongering in the ad is in line with the other kinds of statements the Campaign for Houston has been issuing of late. Whereas in September, the campaigns ads claimed that transgender women are filthy, disgusting, and unsafe and implied that HERO puts women and children at risk and in harms way, the groups statements have tried to raise the stakes even more since then. If they can't lie about it, if they can't lie and then create fear about it, it ain't a religious teaching. Thanks from foundit66 and Camelot I'm a good grrrl, I am.

Transgender men and women are not criminals, nor do they "scare" me. Horrible, soulless people who want to scare others into believing their crap do bother me. A lot.

They are the AlQaeda of our nation; the fundamentalists, least educated. They are the ones who LOVE judging others and being rich and NOT giving to the poor because their NIV god of the rich says they don't have to; the NIV god of the rich doesn't love the poor. Who is the NIV god of the rich? He's the interpretation of the Christian bible you get when you rewrite it 10 times... I wonder why thinkprogress failed to mention the Texas Supreme Court rulings regarding this? Last edited by Jimmyb; October 14th, 2015 at 03:10 PM .

LW, I wish I knew who this "god of the rich" is, because I've never run across him in any bible I've ever read. Are you sure your not imagining things? In all fairness I DO believe there is a cult of affluence in America, conspicuous consumption, but in my 50+ years I've not seen much correlation between that and the Bible. In my experience, religion has precious little to do with wanting a bigger house and a fancier car. If you think greed and self-indulgence is limited to people of faith, you need to come back to planet Earth. NOW, regarding these clowns in Houston. As a "born again" evangelical mself, I am of the humble opinion that these conniving political hacks don't know whether to poop or cry, and they'd probably have Jesus arrested for being a vagrant and a public nuisance. IDIOTS! Sexual predators doesn't NEED a law extending basic civil rights to transsexuals in order to follow a little girl into a public restroom. They do it already, and these bozos in Houston, as you correctly say, are using scare tactics in order to push a political agenda. If anyone is a public nuisance, it's them.
