COCOA BEACH — Stars shone, stars were born, records were set and Titusville was overwhelming at the Cape Coast Conference swim meet Friday at the Cocoa Beach Aquatic Center. 
Connor Smoak of Eau Gallie and Dani Keymont of Merritt Island broke their own records in the boys 50-yard freestyle and girls 100-yard breaststroke with times of 21.69 seconds and 1:04.50 respectively, breaking the marks they set last year (22.02 and 1:05.78). 
They also each won a second individual race — Smoak in the boys 100 free (47.22) and Keymont in the girls 200 individual medley (2:03.76). 
Dain Rust of Cocoa Beach established himself as a possible power to be reckoned with in the coming state series when he powered to a time of 59.30 in the 100 breaststroke, which broke Matt Holmes’ 59.70, set last year. Buy Photo

Another name sure to be mentioned again soon is that of Viera’s Peter Haddad, who went 58.69 to take the boys 100 backstroke. Caroline Dumoulin of Merritt Island took the girls 200 free (2:01.94). 
But, overall, Titusville owned the day, with convincing victories by Tyler Tatro in the boys 200 (1:48.76) and 500 free (4:55.60); his brother Evan in the 200 IM (2:01.03) and fly (55.26); Jordan MacDonald in the girls 50 (25.26) and fly (59.17); Julianna Graf in the 500 (5:34.66) and 100 backstroke (1:04.56); and Emma Colvin in the girls 100 free (56.68). 
To ice their cakes — the Terriers won the girls meet with 475 points and the boys with 438 — they also took the girls and boys 200-medley relays; the girls 200-free relay; and the girls and boys 400-free relays. 
On the girls side, Viera finished with 351 points and Cocoa Beach, 299. Cocoa Beach took second among boys at 362, followed by Rockledge, 262. 
Viera’s cause was aided by diving victories by Sarah Rousseau (466.30 points) and Ryan Just (465.35) Thursday at the same pool. 
Rousseau outpointed Ali Giuliani of Eau Gallie (390.40) and Maddy Simmons of Titusville (317.95), and Just finished ahead of Jeff Jones of Titusville (379.15) and teammate Dylan Parris (328.10). 
“I thought it was pretty good,” Smoak said after his sprint victory. “It was a personal best by almost two-tenths of a second. I pretty much knew I had it after the wall. I just kind of kept turning it on with my legs.” 
Their swims were especially gratifying for best friends Keymont and MacDonald, each of whom is coming off injuries. Keymont sported ugly marks from injections in her knee and MacDonald is recovering from a sprained ankle. 
“Oh, thank God,” Keymont said after she broke her breaststroke time, set last year, with a dominant swim. “Yes, I went out to break the record but, no, I didn’t expect it to feel like that. My knee hurt, but not as bad as it used to feel.” 
MacDonald, who was among a group of Titusville and other athletes to cheer Keymont after her victories, was happy to compete again. “I haven’t really kicked in two weeks,” she said. 
The home crowd went wild as Dain Rust approached the finish line in the breaststroke, but Rust took it quietly. “It’s been my goal for quite a while and it’s pretty cool,” he said. “But I really didn’t think about it while I was in the water. I was pushing to win the last 25 yards and I knew what was happening when I heard everyone screaming.” 
As for Titusville, winning conference championships has become habitual, something coach Natasha Kremer ascribed to her swimmers being “willing the make the sacrifices it takes.” 
Evan Tyler Tatro didn’t see the Terriers’ swims as strolls, however. 
“We had it a lot harder here than we thought we would,” he said. “Cocoa Beach put up a good fight, especially. But it was fun and it’s so gratifying to win.” 98 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1RyFVdC TOP VIDEOS
