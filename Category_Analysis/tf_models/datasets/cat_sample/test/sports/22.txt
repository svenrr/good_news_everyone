It was the fifth league title in the last seven years for the Panthers, but having moved on from that, Holliston's focus quickly turned to Step Two: earning the top seed in the Division 4 South playoffs, which guarantees home-field advantage throughout. Behind a pair of rushing touchdowns from senior Matt McIsaac and a key score right before the half, the Panthers got that top seed and finished the regular season unbeaten by trouncing TVL crossover opponent Norton 35-7 Friday night at Kamitian Field. “I'm proud of our kids,” Holliston coach Todd Kiley said. “It's a game that maybe the guys could have looked past this week, but that's not this team's style. We're excited about having that home field advantage. Now, it's about executing every week and making as much noise in the playoffs as we can. “It's extremely important to be at home. This is a phenomenal place to play. We've got our Red Sea, the community supports us big time, and it's a huge advantage, there's no doubt about it.” Holliston (7-0) received the opening kick and got its offense rolling on the game's first possession. Starting with the ball on their own 36, the Panthers put together a seven-play drive – five runs, two passes – which McIsaac (14 carries, 145 yards, 2 TD) ended by finding the end zone from 4 yards out. Grant Buchanan's (5-of-5 PAT) point after made it 7-0 just 1:48 in. Norton was then able to move the ball into Holliston territory, mainly thanks to quarterback Zach Feeney's 30-yard run on third-and-8. But four plays later, on fourth-and-6, Sam Ratcliffe got great pursuit on Feeney, who was forced to throw the ball away for a turnover on downs. That set up the Panthers with the ball on their own 32, and once again, they leaned on their rushing attack. The legs of McIsaac, Barrett, and Ratcliffe combined for 57 yards, with Barrett's arm accounting for another 21 (Holliston had a holding penalty). On second-and-8, Barrett sidestepped a defensive lineman nicely before finding Buchanan from 13 yards out to make it 14-0 with 1:01 left in the opening frame. Barrett was picked off on the Panthers third drive, but after the Lancers (3-4) were forced to punt, Holliston had an important drive before the half. The Panthers began on their own 11 yard line and methodically moved the ball down field, using a balance of pass and run. Their 12-play drive (seven passes, five runs), which took 2:55 off the clock, ended with a touchdown, when on 4th-and-10, Barrett rolled right, then came back to his left and threw one to the far side of the end zone to an open Ciarcello from 19 yards out. That made it 21-0 heading into the intermission. Page 2 of 2 - “We work on our scramble drill a lot during practice,” Barrett said. “You've got to improvise. We've got a lot of football savvy kids on this team and I know they can make a play. That was a huge drive, definitely the biggest of the game. You've got to have momentum going into the half.” On Holliston's first possession of the third quarter, the Panthers moved the ball 64 yards on eight plays, with McIsaac getting his second touchdown, this one from 10 yards out, to make it 28-0. “We've got some seniors on the line and we've got some talented underclassmen as well, so without that line, I wouldn't have been able to do much,” McIsaac said. “The blocking from the receivers was also huge. They worked hard. I've got to give credit where credit is due.” Defensively, Holliston's focus was on Norton running back Justin Ireland, who had accounted for 13 of the Lancers 19 touchdowns coming in. Ireland broke off a 73-yard score late in the fourth quarter, but prior to that, the Panthers held him to 53 yards on the ground. “It's no secret he's their guy and they want to get the ball to him in space,” McIsaac said. “We were preparing for it all week.” By Jared Keene/Daily News Staff   By Jared Keene/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:36 PM Updated at 10:46 PM
