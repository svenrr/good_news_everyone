Its safe to say that the latest version, Pan, directed by frock flick and action specialist Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Hanna), is the most sumptuous of them all and is loaded with the most dazzling set pieces, most of them taking place up in the air. But this origin story starts on the ground, where a sad and desperate-looking Mary (Amanda Seyfried) leaves little Peter, a pan pipe charm hanging on a chain around his neck, in a basket at a London orphanage. Suddenly its 12 years later, and Peter (newcomer Levi Miller, terrific in the role), one of dozens of boys sharing a huge dormitory space, has grown into a mischievous lad who hangs out with his pal Nibs (Lewis MacDougall), both of whom are usually on the run from the stern and cartoonish Mother Barnabus (Kathy Burke). Set in the midst of WWII London, air raids are a regular occurrence, but theres nothing regular about a huge flying pirate ship hovering over the orphanage and, at the stroke of one midnight, dropping white pancake-faced crew members (who are likely members of Cirque du Soleil) on ropes to snatch the sleeping lads and shanghai them off to Neverland. Its there, under the rule of the foppishly dressed Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) that theyll be put to work in the mines, chipping away to find the fairy dust that provides the nefarious pirate with perpetual youth. But the kids doing all of that work dont get to keep their youth; they grow up. One has been there so long, hes now the adult James Hook (Garrett Hedlund), who doesnt exactly befriend young Peter, but does offer a degree of advice concerning how to survive in Neverland. But Peters an excitable lad, and his brashness earns him Blackbeards punishment of walking the plank (over land). Really? Are we going to see our hero crushed to a pulp, way below, 20 minutes into the film? Not to worry. As he soars downward, characters in the film and viewers in the audience find out at the same instant that the boy can fly. Viewers gasp and blurt out, What? Blackbeard afterward invites him to his quarters and worries aloud that Peter is the legendary fellow whos come to vanquish him. Its at about that point that the story, too, like Peter, takes off into the air. Its Blackbeard, bellowing out his lines, chasing after Peter. Its Peter, joining up with Hook and another Blackbeard escapee, Smiegal (Adeel Akhtar), suddenly on a mission to find the mother that left him at the orphanage all those years ago. And in a very Avatar-like manner, we meet the warrior Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), one of the Neverland natives trying to keep Blackbeard from ruining the environment with his endless digging for that rejuvenating fairy dust. (Yes, theres also a political message about saving the land.) Page 2 of 2 - But its really an adventure film, filled with thoughts about staying true to yourself and doing the right thing and good triumphing over evil. Its also a film that celebrates the art of production design. The sets, whether theyre real or digitally created (I didnt check; I dont want to know), are spectacular, and the scenes of pirate ships flying through their airspace are breathtaking. Back down on Earth, theres even a bit of flirting between Hook and Tiger Lily. But its clear that shed rather be fighting for her people, with those thoughts eventually leading to a nicely choreographed down and dirty melee between her and Blackbeard. Some older viewers are going to say theres too much going on at once, while kids will revel in all of the action, and some folks will wonder why theres only a brief cameo of the Disney cartoons famous sidekick Tinker Bell. Should this film do well at the box office, there will be more of that action around the corner, and probably a bigger role for Tinker Bell, as Pan II is already in development.
