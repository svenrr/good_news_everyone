Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 9:41 AM Updated at 9:41 AM More Content Now Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 9:41 AM It has been a mere 15 years since we last heard from Don Henley, solo speaking. His latest album, “Cass County,” is a nice trip back to where it began for the man who grew up in the East Texas plains. Henley’s Southern country-fried rock roots were the framework that helped the Eagles soar to legendary heights during the ’70s. His drumming, singing style, and songwriting talents were second to none. But I’m probably going to wreak some havoc now with this next statement. I think Henley’s solo work is better. Shocking, I know. But the albums “I Can’t Stand Still,”“Building the Perfect Beast,” and “The End of the Innocence” are some of the best albums to come from the 1980s. “Dirty Laundry,”“All She Wants To Do Is Dance,”“Sunset Grill,”“The Boys Of Summer,”“The End of the Innocence,”“The Heart of the Matter” and “The Last Worthless Evening” are classics and are among my go-to songs when I need to escape for a while. Henley’s latest could join the ranks of his prior albums and become a favorite of mine. It’s a country album, too, with a massive list of impeccable artists behind the scenes and a few holding their own with the man himself. The moment I heard he was doing a full-on country album, I was curious to hear the new music. Obviously, the music of the Eagles touched on the line between country and rock, which may be the best explanation of the band’s massive appeal and success. But Henley has a cool way of bringing that relaxed Southern feel to the modern country era. I hope those vying for the country spotlight are taking notes. This is how it’s done. “Cass County” features 11 newly penned tracks and a few impressive covers, done in pure Henley fashion. The album’s first single, “Take a Picture of This,” is 100 percent Henley in his best true grit. I love it! You can’t help but get caught up in the straightforward harmonies of a marriage gone south when he sings, “… Take a picture of this/I’m leavin’/This is me walking away.” “No Thank You,”“Too Much Pride,”“Waiting Tables” and “Too Far Gone” could all be radio staples. The songs feature backing and harmonizing vocals by such artists as Vince Gill, Jamey Johnson, Alison Kraus and LeeAnn Womack. Page 2 of 2 - Henley shares lead vocals with country music icon Merle Haggard on “The Cost of Living” and Mick Jagger and Miranda Lambert for “Bramble Rose.” The highlight has to be the pairing of Henley with one of music’s strongest female voices, Martina McBride, for the rockin’ duet of “That Old Flame.” I see the two of them tearing up awards shows next year with this song. The chemistry in their vocals is what makes two people not just singing together, but powerhouse duet partners. I can see me putting “Cass County” on my GPS and getting lost for a while. Nicely done, Don. David T. Farr is a Sturgis, Michigan, Journal correspondent. Email him at farrboy@hotmail.com. By David T. Farr
