Ethiopia: Ministry Underscores ICT Role in Development 
To help conservationists protect lions from threats they face, The Lion Identification Network of Collaborators (LINC) a crowdfunded project from Lion Guardians, a Kenya-based conservation organization is using facial recognition software and images of the profiles of individual lions. 
LINC is also a collaborative effort with lion researchers across East Africa and software developers around the world. The software development was led by IEF R&D in the USA. LINC is also helping researchers monitor population levels and where different lions travel in their migrations. 
The tool will use an open database paired with the latest computer vision techniques, accessed via an online web portal. Users will upload lion sightings onto LINC. LINC will use facial recognition software to match the current observation with observations in the database by focusing on the specific facial elements that include whisker spots and eye markings. 
In the past, lions could only be identified through photographs taken with high quality cameras and focusing on specific identification zones, such as whisker spots. Facial recognition of lions would open the door to millions of photographs taken of lions by the public and provide a platform to share that information, thereby vastly increasing knowledge of lion populations. 
Lions movements throughout Africa are poorly understood, and tracking efforts come with a host of difficulties: GPS transmitters are expensive. In addition, unlike leopards, cheetahs and tigers--whose spots and stripes make identification fairly easy--adult lions lack recognizable coat patterns. LINC would therefore allow intensive monitoring of lions across their range, rather than being restricted to localized projects. Within the next few months about 1,000 lions will be added to LINC. 
LINC will also contain the lion's data on its presence (date/time and location 'a lion' was seen) , Lion demographics (was the lion a male or female? Approx. age? Were there cubs (indicator that reproduction is occurring in the area, or possibly just a dispersal area), Individual ID of lion (whisker spots and other identifying characteristics) Lion ID photographs including camera trap photographs 
These data will then be interpreted using advanced facial recognition technology to match photographs contributed by users. The automated system match will be verified by lion researchers in the initial stages. As the product matures, we envision that trained citizen scientists would also be involved in the verification process. 
The project was implemented over eight months from October, 2014 and was launched in June including fundraising, database development, and facial recognition software and website portal. With LINC, the conservation organization and other wildlife researchers will have an easier way to monitor the beasts' whereabouts. Kenya
